EAPR,Cambodia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Goal area 1: Every child survives and thrives
Targeted interventions are effective in tackling inequities between population groups and achieving concrete improvements in health outcomes. Interventions included outreach to hard-to-reach populations in north-eastern provinces, which improved equity in immunization coverage and reduced drop-out among the target population.
Evidence-based programming helps identify gaps and redirect interventions towards increased effectiveness. A longitudinal study continues to provide valuable information for programming, for example on the importance of changing people’s behaviour so that they separate human dwellings from animals and livestock. This reduces the risk of children coming into direct contact with animal faeces and ensures improved nutritional status.
Innovation is critical to tackling challenges. UNICEF supported the production of ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) through a local, private-sector food producer. This is now managed locally. The RUTF has been accredited for use in the treatment of malnutrition, reducing Cambodia’s dependence on international supplies.
Government ownership is crucial for sustainable program implementation. The advocacy effort resulted to get 170,000 USD from the Government treasury for treatment of sever acute malnutrition. Effort is underway for increased amount of allocation and to further take full ownership to ensure program sustainability.
 
Goal area 2: Every child learns
Through persistent work in consolidating and increasing donor support for UNICEF Cambodia’s education programme in 2019, UNICEF continued to implement programmes with MoEYS on a national scale, and in a wide range of areas that directly support the reform priorities of MoEYS. These included programmes relating to public financial management and the more efficient and effective use of scholarship investments, school-based management, teacher development, school inspection, and inclusive education, such as multilingual education. This continues to reach a greater number of students from a larger range of ethno-cultural backgrounds.
Evidence generation and policy dialogue continue to be important for policy formulation and implementation. Two evaluations of the MoEYS scholarship and multilingual education programmes were completed in 2019. An outcome evaluation, ‘Education Capacity Development Partnership Fund (CDPF) Phases I and II’ was awarded the UNICEF 2018 Best Evaluation.
UNICEF commissioned a participatory gender audit of MoEYS to promote organizational learning and action on how to realize gender-equitable leadership. These strategic investments support MoEYS policy makers to use research evidence more for policy dialogue, policy implementation and resource prioritization.
Goal area 3: Every child is protected from violence and exploitation
UNICEF continues to work on strengthening child protection systems at district and commune levels so that child protection services can be delivered even closer to where children live. This includes strengthening social service and child protection workforces, specifically their capacity, data management and monitoring systems.
Data management for child protection is fragmented in Cambodia. Through its good relationships with different government agencies, UNICEF supported the coordination of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Veterans and Youth Rehabilitation (MoSVY) and key ministries on how to systematically generate annual child protection data for the child protection information management system (CPIMS) as part of regular reporting systems.
 Adolescent and youth groups reviewed the progress made in the inter-ministerial Action Plan to Prevent and Respond to Violence against Children 2017-2021 and identified the gaps and recommendations through a series of consultations. These recommendations were complied into a Children’s Statement, which was handed over to the Ministry of Social Affairs, Veterans and Youth Rehabilitation at the launch of Cambodia as a Pathfinding Country in September 2019. The Ministry, with support from UNICEF, will ensure that relevant ministries will take action following these recommendations throughout the implementation of the Action Plan
 UNICEF worked with young people  and supported them to engage with the government institutions in policy dialogues and programme development. As a result, the Ministry of Women’s Affairs has included the child marriage issue in their plan as one of their priority areas. UNICEF also worked with the NGO CRC-Cambodia which supported young people to engage directly with communities in disseminating education materials, including short videos on the negative impact of child marriage as a first step towards  changing the social norms which condone the child marriage practice.
An innovative ‘Roundtable for the Pathway to Safe Childhood: Leveraging Partnerships to End Violence against Children in Cambodia’ was held on the same day that Cambodia was launched as a Pathfinding Country. MoSVY hosted the roundtable, in collaboration with UNICEF and the Global Partnership to End Violence against Children. It brought together more than 60 representatives of development partners, the private sector and government ministries.
Goal area 4: Every child lives in a safe and clean environment
Working with 15 local latrine businesses, and through pro-poor financing, UNICEF assisted poor households to purchase partially subsidized toilets.
There was promising initial progress in 2019 related to innovating with the private sector, government, and civil society organizations on future public-private partnership models for private piped water suppliers, as well as work with private bottled water suppliers. Work to support fuller realization is an important opportunity for 2020.
Goal area 5: Every child has an equitable chance in life
Building on lessons learned UNICEF will strengthen inter-ministerial collaboration for social protection programming. To ensure efficient data collection and capacity building, the use of technology in service delivery and training will be further promoted, including the use of tablets and mobile device management tools that were introduced in 2019. 
Funding under the SDG Fund for Social Protection, the sub-regional Public Financial Management Facility, and the EU-funded project on linking social protection and public financial management will lead to expanded coverage of social assistance programmes. UNICEF will work towards strengthening the existing disability allowance programme and the development of an integrated family package for social assistance.
Cross-cutting and integrated programming
A strong cross-sectoral focus was maintained in 2019, as collaboration between UNICEF Cambodia’s education and child protection sections continued to show substantial results in preventing and reducing violence in schools. Technical partnerships were deepened on WASH, health and nutrition, as schools are increasingly mapping and improving their WASH facilities, and on health education, including comprehensive sexuality education, which is moving closer to nationwide rollout in 2021.
UNICEF innovated to strengthen climate resilience in water supply programming through a climate-sensitive risk analysis, water source improvements, and the drafting of climate-sensitive technical and management guidance for piped water system operators.
The formative evaluation of the Integrated Early Childhood Development approach implemented from 2016 to 2018 provided both strategic and service-level recommendations for future implementation of the new National Action Plan on early childhood care and development.
In September 2019, UNICEF held a Strategic Moment of Reflection on how its programming could be modified and advanced to improve the lives of adolescents in Cambodia. The rationale for the reflection was to deepen the understanding of links and synergies regarding adolescents in urban areas, and how they are affected by climate change, environmental issues and violence.
"
EAPR,China,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Valuable lessons were learned in 2019 which will inform our future programme design, including the development of a new five-year country programme of cooperation with the Government of China. This includes both technical areas related to the current country programme in China (social work and Child-Friendly Cities), overarching areas such as evaluation, and leveraging China’s global engagement and investments.
Although the government is increasing its commitment to the provision of social services and child protection for children and families, we are continuing to learn about the challenges and gaps that remain in planning, developing and supporting the social service workforce (SSWF) to deliver quality services. UNICEF continues working with MCA to strengthen the workforce, with a focus on: (a) a clearer SSWF structure at different levels that corresponds to context and demand; (b) setting up a professional qualification certification system for social work for children; and (c) improving monitoring and evaluation for the SSWF through setting up standards, indicators and a professional code of ethics and conduct.
A number of cities, most notably Shenzhen and Changsha, have proactively initiated their own efforts on becoming child-friendly in accordance with the Child-Friendly City Initiative (CFCI) framework, while seeking a formal partnership with UNICEF to become part of a global network of cities that have been recognised, or aspire to become child-friendly cities. For this to gain momentum, a national partner by way of a ministry-level governmental entity needs to be identified. UNICEF has and continues to invest considerable time and efforts in consulting with possible national-level partners, while also facilitating the Government’s participation in international forums and exchanges focused on CFCI. UNICEF China has spent a few years planning for CFCI and made changes at the Mid-Term Review of the country programme to facilitate this, including staffing and management changes. However, in 2019, the central government issued a regulation on reducing certifying, appraising or ranking of cities to reduce the burden placed on cities by the national level. A lesson learned for UNICEF is that we need to be adaptable and creative in how we frame the urban agenda for children, and not be too narrowly-focused on only CFCI and better recognizing it as a useful entry point to a wider agenda.
 
UNICEF and the National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention (NCNCD) under the China CDC used personal tablets to collect survey responses for a provincial Violence against Children Survey (VACS), which made this the first self-administered household VACS globally. Employing this innovation made it possible to further protect respondents’ privacy, and improved quality control, response rate, the validity of the responses and data management, and lowered the financial costs. These are important lessons not just for the China country programme, but may have applicability to other countries.
 
The NWCCW-UNICEF joint evaluation on the CFS project was completed this year and recognized the success of the project in terms of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact, equity and gender equality, and sustainability for the welfare and protection of children and families, in particular through child participation and community empowerment. It also identified challenges of CFSs fully achieving their child protection functions in communities. The lack of a national level child protection system and coordination was also identified as a challenge. Recommendations have been proposed and discussed at a validation workshop with GoC. The validation workshop itself was identified as a good practice to engage government counterparts in all phases of the evaluation. And, the findings of the evaluation have informed discussions on the future approach of UNICEF’s support to child protection and child welfare in the next programme cycle.
UNICEF’s engagement in South-South cooperation and partnerships continued to grow in 2019 with staff onboarding and results being achieved, including the signing of a major implementation agreement with the government. The set-up of this function in UNICEF China has provided valuable lessons learned. For example, some policymakers and influencers in the Government of China need to know more about UNICEF and our value proposition for South-South cooperation. The time required to build a relationship with a new partner for supporting SDG attainment for children globally should not be underestimated.  Negotiation of the implementation agreement and technical evaluation of project proposals submitted to the South-South Cooperation Assistance Fund were lengthy. A lesson learned is that these negotiations and commitments for funding cannot be secured in short timeframes, and issues that initially seem straightforward can take many months of negotiation. Allocating sufficient time and resources to these areas is essential.
These key lessons have served to inform ongoing plans, as well as the development of the next five-year country programme. UNICEF also continues to play an active role within the UN system in China, ensuring that goals and targets set by the UN include those that aim to meet the needs of underserved children and women in China. And, that UNICEF through its assistance to the Government of China continues to work towards realising children’s rights in China while strengthening our engagement with GoC to advance the SDGs for children in other developing countries.
"
EAPR,DP Republic of Korea,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The DPRK-UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation 2017–2021 MTR was held in August 2019 with EAPRO support. Participants included senior Government officials, UNICEF senior staff from EAPRO (including the Deputy Regional Director), and all UNICEF DPRK programme staff, officers from other United Nations agencies and NGOs, along with members of the diplomatic corps. The MTR, which included the presentation of the new SitAn and a series of equity analysis products based on MICS data, was hailed by the United Nations and donor community as a programme milestone conducted with an unprecedented breadth of evidence and levels of openness and participation for the DPRK context.
The MTR report was presented to the Government mid-October and met with appreciation for the delivery of UNICEF-supported results for children greater than those committed in the CPD (IMNCI, CMAM, emergency response). Other jointly noted high-level areas of achievement and need for continued cooperation included the following.
Balancing humanitarian and live-saving supplies with high-quality technical assistance for equity. Supporting the delivery of essential services, including the provision of critical and life-saving supplies, has been at the centre of the country programme. This has led to change for children that exceeded targets, while systemically advancing the capacity of service providers and caregivers to identify, analyse and address humanitarian needs and risks and to deliver vital life-saving services to the most vulnerable.
Strong cross-sectoral and integrated approaches applied to reduce vulnerability. The country programme emphasizes strong cross-sectoral and integrated approaches to reduce multidimensional vulnerability in DPRK. The focus of this approach has been through application of the ‘first 1,000 days of life’ approach, linking nutrition, health and WASH interventions in nine Convergence Counties. The MTR found that in the Convergence Counties there had been more synergistic actions across the programmes, particularly in relation to capacity development, including more frequent monitoring and supportive supervision. The MTR found that there was a need for more cross-sectoral communication and formative research, ongoing monitoring and a strong commitment by Government and UNICEF to demonstrate the benefits to children’s survival and healthy development of stronger coordination and more integrated programming at local level.
Improved availability, quality and use of disaggregated data to better analyse the situation of children and women. A particular emphasis was placed in the first half of the country programme on supporting the Government of DPRK to improve the availability, quality and use of disaggregated data to better analyse the situation of children and women. These efforts, including conducting the 2017 MICS, have informed policy and strategy development, and improved design, equity-focused targeting, implementation and monitoring of services, particularly for those left farthest behind.
The MTR found that the programme focus on Health, Nutrition and WASH, supplemented with efforts to strengthen the quality and use of data and evidence for children, remained valid and should continue until the end of the country programme. Most of the strategic focus and emphases of the programmes were found to be solidly grounded and contributing to significant achievements for children and women, particularly those most vulnerable. The MTR highlighted the need for three overall strategic modifications to the country programme approach to enhance its effectiveness to support the Government in achieving greater results for children, particularly the most vulnerable:
1. Accelerate the move beyond access to services to a greater focus on quality of systems and services.
2. Strengthen integration, collaboration and multisectoral approaches.
3. Intensify support to fill gaps in timely data, evidence and analysis.
The follow-up to these opportunities, together with the Country Programme Evaluation slated for 2020, will form the key programme process priorities of 2020 and lead into the development of the next CPD for 2022–2026. In addition, sustaining compliance with audit recommendations closed in 2019 will remain crucial to UNICEF support in the specific DPRK context. This concerns continued advocacy to the Government about the need for expanded and flexible access to areas and people, while adhering to humanitarian principles in delivering vital services to children in areas without or with partial access. Concomitantly, it is necessary to maintain the strong UNICEF set-up for field monitoring and supportive supervision finalized in 2019, which comprises third-party monitoring, automated tracking of monitoring performance indicators and recommendations, as well as production of annual and monthly monitoring reports to mitigate risks, enhance assurance and increase accountability to donor partners.
Operations and accountability requirements in the specific humanitarian environment continued posing challenges. In relation to Government, improved access; follow-through with equity-focused draft strategies on WASH and Nutrition; flexible cooperation with technical-level counterparts; the need for more frequent and disaggregated routine data; and access to national policies and public finance information will form the 2020 advocacy agenda. Externally, challenges remain regarding in-country cash availability and unintended consequences of sanctions, which slowed down supplies and programme delivery, despite marked improvement thanks to Implementation Assistance Notice No. 7 of 2018, which aimed to operationalize exemption from international sanctions for United Nations humanitarian action. Continued efforts on proactive compliant approaches in the given set-up, along with field visits for all stakeholders providing insight into the situation on the ground, will remain important to advance the fuller realization of child rigths.
It is clear that strengthened external communication and advocacy highlighting the real situation and need to support children and women is required to sustain UNICEF DPRK’s combination of life-saving humanitarian programmes and its advocacy for social development. UNICEF DPRK communication expertise, including for in-country cross-sectoral communication on the ‘first 1,000 days of life’ approach, linking nutrition, health and WASH, and other child rights areas, is limited by the context and depends on Regional Office support. Going forward, ways to expand capacities for outreach and communication, including for the mobilization of crucial resources, need to be found if UNICEF is to support increased delivery on promises to children.

EAPR,Fiji (Pacific Islands),Lessons Learned and Innovations,"A unique Pacific regional multi-sectoral coordination mechanism on early childhood development (ECD) and its linkages with climate change
The high-level and multi-sectoral Pacific Regional Council on Early Childhood Development is an innovative model of coordination. Comprised of ministers and permanent secretaries from the finance, health, education and social welfare ministries, the council helps drive a collective agenda for ECD in the region, with plans to explore reporting to the Pacific Leaders Forum (the highest inter-governmental forum in the Pacific) through the Forum of Economic Ministers. In a first for the region, Pacific governments discussed the linkages between ECD and climate change at the 2019 Pacific ECD Forum. The Pacific is extremely vulnerable to the impact of climate change and Pacific leaders have taken a prominent role on the global stage to advocate for urgent climate action. Forum delegates recognized the critical role of ECD for climate change risk mitigation, resilience-building and adaptation strategies, in line with the call by 2019 Pacific Islands Leaders Forum focusing on climate changes, health and wellbeing of Pacific people.
Innovative media partnership on raising awareness around healthy eating habits
An innovative advocacy partnership between UNICEF and celebrity chef Robert Oliver’s reality television series “Pacific Island Food Revolution (PIFR)” using TV cooking challenge as a stimulating, evocative and entertaining medium to communicate healthy eating using locally available foods.  This represents an innovative strategy to engage with audiences in the Pacific on healthy eating.
UNICEF provided technical information on healthy eating and weight management during pregnancy and appropriate complementary feeding, while PIFR transformed the information into ‘edutainment’. The season one finale was dedicated to ‘Foods for the First 1,000 Days’. Contestants competed to cook the best foods for pregnant mothers and children under 2 years of age. The programme was free-to-air in 12 PICTs, with preliminary data indicating that women exposed to the programme were 146 per cent more likely to choose healthy food options.
The success of season one prompted the continuation of the partnership, with season two including a challenge on healthy school lunches. In parallel, UNICEF produced the ‘Pacific Youth Food Revolution’, featuring three cooking teams comprised of children led by celebrity chef Robert Oliver and UNICEF Pacific Ambassador Pita Taufatofua. The production shows Pacific children teaching other children how to cook clean, simple, inexpensive and nutritious foods. This production highlighted the importance of establishing good health during school as transition to adulthood and parenthood. Filmed in an instructional format for use by ministries, schools, health workers and communities, the production is aired during advertisement breaks of the reality TV show across more than 20 networks in PICTs
Beyond training: systems-based capacity building for PHC
To improve the quality of primary health and nutrition services, UNICEF is adopting a systems approach to building capacity in three countries: Kiribati, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu.  The approach has three elements: a continuous professional development system linked to accreditation/professionalization of the primary health worker, supportive supervision and accompaniment of PHC workers in their daily work to help translate learning into practice by solving problems in situ using the available equipment, medicines and skills at the PHC facility, and community engagement and accountability creating a dual platform for behaviour change and for communities and local governments to play a role in improving the quality of health and nutrition services.  As seen in Kiribati, this approach is proving powerful in its potential for positive change and inclusive engagement.
Reaching out to furthest behind and marginalized children 
UNICEF Pacific explores innovative solutions to address equity and to overcome challenges faced by children in the region. For example, UNICEF piloted the Vanuatu Drone Trial, designed to increase vaccination coverage by delivering vaccines by remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS). UNICEF formed a consortium with Vanuatu’s MoH and Civil Aviation Authority, with support from DFAT and the Global Fund. During 2019, phase two was successfully completed, demonstrating the potential of drones to improve vaccines delivery to the remote islands. A final report of the first two phases was launched in September 2019 by the Government of Vanuatu followed by a national workshop to compile lessons learned and to reflect on the planning of phase three for scale-up to wider coverage and service provision.
In addition, UNICEF started installing disability-friendly handwashing facilities at schools, designed and developed by Field Ready, an international civil society organization (CSO) with strong humanitarian innovation and engineering skills. Field Ready also designed a gender- and culturally-appropriate emergency latrine package.
Financing facility for evidence generation in the Pacific
UNICEF is collaborating with the South Pacific Community (SPC) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) to support evidence generation in the Pacific. In 2019, a joint proposal was developed for a Pacific Statistical Collections Financing Facility and presented to the Donor and Development Partner Group meeting and the Pacific Statistics Standing Committee (PSSC). This facility aims to support the implementation of the five-year regional statistical collection plan, 2019 to 2023 including censuses and surveys (MICS, Household Expenditures Survey, etc.). The facility will support PICTs to fill budget gaps related to data collection and will provide additional resources to technical partners (UNICEF, UNFPA, SPC, etc) to support PICTs to produce high quality and timely data collection. The PSSC directed the technical partners to propose a governance and financing architecture, which will be further discussed in 2020.
Addressing human resource gaps in multi-country context through volunteer partnership programmes
During the first two years implementing the current UNICEF multi-country programme, it has become clear that all 14 PICTs require long-term, in-country technical assistance to improve human resource capacity. To this end, partnerships with Australian Volunteers for International Development (AVID) and Volunteer Services Abroad New Zealand (VSA) have been developed on child protection. Seven volunteers from AVID have been placed in 2019 and one volunteer from VSA will be placed in 2020 in the social welfare ministries in six PICTs to provide technical assistance and on-the-job coaching to social welfare officers and managers. This approach is cost-effective to bring essential expertise to support the 14 countries.
"
EAPR,Indonesia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Sub-national engagement for UNICEF programmes has been strongly influenced by the effects of government regulation PP/10/2011 on procedures for acceptance of foreign grants. In practice, UNICEF and other development partners have not been able to transfer funds to sub-national level, thus making national line ministries the responsible parties for UNICEF workplans. Despite efforts to strengthen national cooperation, the decentralized nature of the country and continuing demand for UNICEF interventions have shifted the focus of implementation to sub-national civil society organization (CSO) partnerships that pilot innovative approaches to key development challenges for children. While this has somewhat reduced ownership by sub-national government over the UNICEF programme, it has also strengthened the innovation capacity of the FOs.  In 2019, this lesson led UNICEF and Bangda/MoHA to pilot a new sub-national fund channeling mechanism, developed with the Ministry of Finance, which allows Bangda to “implement” sub-national activities on behalf of the provinces.  By the end of the year it was clear that this approach was leading to strengthened capacity for engagement, coordination and monitoring of UNICEF programmes by sub-national government.
 
Vaccine hesitancy emerged in 2018 during the second phase of measles-rubella campaign: this shook public confidence in vaccines and highlighted challenges in reaching all children. To increase vaccine acceptance, with the support of UNICEF, the MoH has launched several innovative initiatives. Considering the decentralized government, as well as geographic and cultural diversity, a tailored bottom-up, Human-Centered Design (HCD) approach has been introduced. Staff from MoH, eight provinces, and CSOs have been trained in HCD methodologies, to inform a foundation for sub-national health programming.
 
In 2018, UNICEF conducted a formative evaluation of its partnership strategies [1]. The evaluation noted the vast array of partners, including government, civil society, academia, donors, private sector, media and other groups. Given the substantial growth in CSO partnerships noted above, the evaluation recommended that UNICEF consider its overall upstream theory-of-change in Indonesia and re-prioritize the role of central and provincial government to increase the impact of its work. The evaluation also recommended that UNICEF strengthen its overall approach to non-financial partnerships, since an effective advocacy agenda requires engaging partners for their catalytic influencing capacity, not simply as channels for fund implementation.  Management response to the evaluation in 2019 led to the improved fund-channeling mechanism noted above, improved partnership review procedures, and strengthened attempts at long-term partnerships beyond specific funding cycles.
 
In 2019, UNICEF conducted a formative evaluation of the CSD cluster [2], which noted significant progress in advancing results for children across the health, nutrition and WASH sectors, yet found little added value in the clustered approach at outcome level. The evaluation has therefore recommended that the next country programme have greater explicit attention to integration and collaboration strategies across all sectors, in addition to recommendations related to programme priorities, programme strategies, additional capacities, and gender analysis.
 
UNICEF response to the devastating earthquakes that struck Central Sulawesi and Lombok in mid-2018 led to significant refreshing of in-house emergency response capacity. The office raised approximately US$25m through the 2018 and 2019 Humanitarian Action for Children appeal, funds that were intended to be spent in the initial six months (October 2018–March 2019). However, implementation rates proved to be much slower since needs assessment, recruitment and partnership building in a region of the country where there was previously no UNICEF cooperation (Central Sulawesi) took time. The key lesson learned has been that preparedness and disaster risk reduction (DRR) need to be integral aspects of UNICEF cooperation in Indonesia, including at sub-national level, with focus on the humanitarian-development nexus to sustain the long-term benefits of investments that were made by government, UNICEF and partners during the response.
 
In 2019, two best practice UN partnerships were identified:
 
First, UNICEF worked in close collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) to provide support to the government to respond to the polio outbreak in Papua. Through a combination of technical assistance, communication for development and advocacy, nearly 1.2 million children in Papua and West Papua provinces received at least one dose of polio vaccine, achieving the required herd immunity of 95 per cent. This included, through Special Logistic Air Support, 32,000 children immunized in the remote Yahukimo district, the epicenter of the outbreak. The partnership between UNICEF and WHO proved vital in supporting the government to obtain these results. The main components were: joint planning with the government at national and subnational levels; close coordination with subnational authorities and a clear division of labour among key stakeholders.
 
Second, on nutrition, there has proved to be strong lessons learned on inter-agency coordination.  The Donor and UN Country Network for Nutrition (DUNCNN) of the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement is a coordination platform for donors and UN agencies that have significant contribution to the government’s nutrition agenda. The DUNCNN is chaired by UNICEF and the World Bank and meets quarterly to support the SUN Secretariat under Bappenas and share ongoing activities and good practices in nutrition. For example, the DUNCNN conducted an activity mapping exercise and knowledge compilation to inform the government on what nutrition-related programmes that donors and UN partners are implementing and what learning has emerged.
 
UNICEF also chairs the UN Working Group for Nutrition and Food Security. This year, the group focused on three nutrition and food security challenges (anaemia, overweight and obesity and food systems) and developed joint statements targeting both policy makers and the public. UNICEF also embarked on a new programme to develop nutrition literacy products for primary school children with the World Food Programme. Given the lack of investment in the nutrition of school-age children by the government, UNICEF and WFP have partnered to bring together nutrition and food security expertise to tackle the double burden of malnutrition among this age group. UNICEF and WFP have advocated to include nutrition education in the national curriculum and for nutrition literacy products.

EAPR,Lao People's Dem Rep.,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The 2019 Mid-Term Review (MTR) of the Country Programme of Cooperation of the Government of Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and UNICEF was conducted at mid-way through the five-year implementation cycle. The MTR took account of information and data from regular programme monitoring, evaluations, and sector consultancy reports, as well as specific MTR-related processes such as the 2019 Situation Analysis, visits and workshops with UNICEF Regional Advisors, and consultations with Government sector ministries, development partners, civil society, the private sector, and children and adolescents themselves. The objectives of the MTR were to identify required adjustments to accelerate the achievement of planned programme results; to align UNICEF support to national development plans and evolving global priorities, particularly considering Lao PDR’s impending 2024 “graduation” from Least Developed Country Status and its expected transition to “Upper Middle Income” status in 2030; and to accelerate action at scale to tackle child deprivations.
The MTR has been conducted in three phases. Phase one focused on evidence generation and a Situation Analysis to reflect changes in the national and sub-national priorities and policies, reflecting UNICEF global priorities, defining major new or emerging opportunities for programme cooperation strengthening, and indicating how these could be taken forward in the current and next Country Programmes. Phase two entailed synthesis and assessment of evidence from phase one, consolidating the findings, elaborating recommendations for adjustments, and ensuring alignment with UNICEF regional and global priorities. Phase three focused on implementing the proposed shifts during the remainder of the current Country Programme, contributing to the development of the Country Programme 2022-2026, the UN Common Country Assessment (CCA) and the UN Partnership Framework (UNPF) 2022-2026.
The findings of the 2019 Situation Analysis (SitAn) show that Lao PDR has made significant progress for children and adolescents, including achieving many of the targets of the global Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). However, significant shortcomings remain regarding child rights as a critical factor in developing Lao PDR’s human capital to permit accelerated development to achieve both national development objectives and the global objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030. Recent evidence and analyses (LSIS-II, MODA, etc.) demonstrate that, while there is good progress in several areas, significant disparities persist, particularly affecting children from rural areas, girls, and children from non-Lao-Thai ethnic groups, all of whom continue to fare worse than other children in health, nutrition, education and protection indicators. Another group of findings indicate that significant bottlenecks remain with respect to policy development and implementation, the availability of national budgetary resources, inter-institutional coordination, institutional capacity (especially at the provincial, district and community levels); shortfalls in service quality, low levels of demand for existing services, and the persistence of harmful social norms including violence against children, child labor, child marriage and negative attitudes against children with disabilities.
The 2019 MTR found that the Government of Lao PDR-UNICEF Programme of Cooperation is generally on track towards its foreseen results, with certain areas that need to be accelerated or strengthened, some new strategies that are required, and a few areas of UNICEF cooperation that should be phased out. Aligning with Lao PDR’s plans to graduate from LDC status by 2024, and in response to increasing urbanisation and climate change, scaling-up should be the focus for the remainder of the current Country Programme and the Country Programme 2022-2026, converging around (i) system strengthening, (ii) policy advocacy and partnerships, and (iii) demand creation and participation. Innovation and Technology for Development (T4D) will be mainstreamed across strategies.
Systems strengthening: As the country is moving towards middle-income country status and many programmes are in transition or graduation, it is imperative to focus on system strengthening. UNICEF will reduce its service delivery component and system support interventions in favour of system strengthening. A more robust approach to the implementation of demonstration and modelling projects will be adopted, linking them more closely to system strengthening and scaling-up strategies. For example, in health, a strategic shift from a programme-focused approach (MCH, Immunization and Nutrition) to health system strengthening, particularly at sub-national level, is required.
UNICEF will also focus on strengthening its work in Public Finance Management (PFM) to support scaling-up based on investment and sustainability plans, and planning/monitoring the implementation of budgets for children. UNICEF will also increase documentation of models of capacity building for provincial and district planning and coordination and make recommendations for its replication in the Country Programme 2022-2026, including for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR).
Policy advocacy and partnerships: UNICEF will develop innovative mechanisms to generate more frequent data and evidence to improve decision making on critical priorities for children, including use of new technologies and other new approaches. UNICEF’s new engagement in Social Protection – including Mother and Child Cash Grants modelling – requires a more robust Theory of Change for Social Inclusion, considering crucial linkages with the Child Protection System and Parenting Package.
UNICEF will continue to strengthen partnerships and alliance building in favour of children and adolescents, seeking enhanced accountability for the implementation of child-related policies and programmes, including with the private sector. As one of the key priorities for the 9th NSEDP and building on the strong alliance with key development partners, focus will be laid on the renewed commitments to CRC@30, to support and sustain investments in children and young people who will be born and grow up between now and 2030.
Demand creation and participation: The Country Programme will focus more on areas which are lagging, particularly improving ECCD practices, including health, nutrition, WASH and parenting, birth registration, and ending child marriage. In this regard, UNICEF will make use of expanded strategies for Communication for Development (C4D) to accelerate and expand convergent social behaviour change interventions, especially for remote, excluded and vulnerable children and populations. Moreover, UNICEF will expand its Youth and Adolescents programming, focusing on the most important factors affecting adolescent girls, primarily early marriage and adolescent pregnancies, which are closely linked to school dropouts.
"
EAPR,Malaysia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"There have been a number of key lessons learnt this year across UNICEF Programme. These have been mainly around strengthening integrated approach to policy advocacy through evidence generation and research. Under Social Protection, a system-wide approach is important in balancing child-focused advocacy. Beyond advocating for change from a child rights perspective, UNICEF advocacy required greater awareness of wider demographic, social, economic, institutional and fiscal factors to maximize relevance and effectiveness. It is particularly true in terms of social protection reform but is also relevant to UNICEF’s engagement on social workforce strengthening. Additionally, UNICEF policy engagements in support of reduced disparities among Malaysia’s children needed to be more informed by public finance and institutional analysis. Particular attention needed to be paid to developing a cogent, evidence-based case for increased public investment in programmes and services for children, and the implications of Malaysia’s fragmented and highly centralized institutional framework for the capacity building agenda. This cannot be achieved without the availability of quality disaggregated data and other requisite researches that provide a basis for sound policy analysis. This will be an advocacy agenda for the next few years especially as part of the next country programme planning.
 
In terms of building effective partnerships to influence policy change, it is important that a strategic and coherent vision; systematic and sustained advocacy strategies are built through technical, contextual and diplomacy capacities/skills. These skills were particularly crucial during the Out-of-School-Children (OOSCI) study whereby the partnership between UNICEF and Government complimented the approach on strategic collaboration particularly with MoE. This also created a shared ownership and sense of concern and understanding on equity issues in education. UNICEF strategically positioned the two OOSC studies for greater buy-in from the government. Inviting all stakeholders and government agencies together for every technical meeting led to a smooth endorsement for both studies when the two studies were combined as one report. A complementary partnership and ability to view challenges as opportunities by acknowledging the challenges was key in building trust and a solid working relationship especially with Government. The strength of UNICEF’s strategic collaboration with MoE has also resulted in nationwide school children participation in the Country Programme Document processes, Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Summit, CRC@30 and #StandTogether campaigns.
 
To sustain stronger partnerships, developing a partnership strategy prior to initiating a new programme could have helped broaden UNICEF’s partnership network for programming, and can help more effectively achieve programme results across programme sectors. This will be planned under the formulation of new country programme, especially since the new United Nations Sustainable Development Framework (UNSDCF) also warrants joint programmes and stronger partnerships. Under UNSDCF, closer collaboration with other United Nations agencies is imperative. It has been learned that the engagement to strengthen the child-sensitivity of Malaysia’s social protection system cannot be done in isolation from a wider work on social protection reform. Collaborated efforts with the International Labour Organization (ILO), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and World Bank will contribute in reaching the goal and advocating for intended change.
 
To overcome the lack of understanding on Communication for Development (C4D) and social and behaviour change communication among stakeholders, UNICEF has partnered academic institutions to further cascade C4D capacity in country. From the experience of Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS)-UNICEF C4D unit, UNICEF learned that establishing a C4D centre is the first step and requires an ongoing technical support and network building for sustainability.
 
Results on innovation were planned in the current country programme not only as a separate result but also as a cross-cutting area to strengthen change for children. Experience and achievements so far indicate that there is value add through innovations that need to be strategically embedded within the core programming. UNICEF also recognizes the opportunity for innovation to serve as a convening force across the United Nations (UN) system in Malaysia as part of the wider UN reform. There is the opportunity for UNICEF to join forces with the UNDP Accelerator Lab initiative – as part of the global partnership – to ensure that relevant UN innovations take children into account children and young people, and to co-create and implement solutions for serving children and young people. Furthermore, promising solutions and initiatives can benefit from the global UNICEF Innovation Fund where needed.
 
Disability-Inclusive programming has begun to be mainstreamed across the whole country office. This is based on the preliminary recommendations from a formative evaluation of the #ThisAbility Flagship initiative and a theory of change exercise on disability, both conducted during the year. The evaluation preliminary recommendations indicate that UNICEF needs to: fully embed disability into key planning documents and ensure that children with disabilities are included and monitored across all areas of programming.
 
Joint efforts with government and civil-society partners further strengthened disability-inclusive programming.  A partnership between UNICEF and Special Olympics Asia Pacific (SOAP) was established to pilot and seek feasible modalities on inclusive health, education and sports services for children and families with and without intellectual disabilities in Sabah In addition, commitment has been made with the Sabah Welfare Department to develop a 2-year workplan to strengthen their disability-inclusive service provision and knowledge.
 
Lastly, UNICEF Malaysia has begun the preparations for a Climate Change and Environmental Sustainability programme that will be included in the 2021-2025 programme cycle. The programme was borne out of the UNICEF global commitment to addressing the global climate emergency, and at the same time to address climate and environmental issues such as air and water pollution affecting children’ health and wellbeing in Malaysia. Several consultations have been held with key stakeholders including the Ministry of Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change, Ministry of Health, UNDP and youth organisations to inform the programme, with a partnership being established with the national university UKM to conduct a study in 2020.

EAPR,Mongolia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"1. Lesson learned from UNICEF Mongolia’s Inclusive Education Programme Evaluation
UNICEF carried out an evaluation of ‘Inclusive Basic Education in the UNICEF Country Programmes 2012–2016 and 2017–2021’, with the aim of generating evidence about the results achieved as well as lessons learned. The evaluation concluded that UNICEF support and work in this area is still relevant and valid, and that supporting inclusive education may be even more relevant than before because inclusion and equity are still emerging in education sector development in Mongolia. It further stated that the programme was effective and successful in terms of strengthening legal frameworks, enhancing capacity on and around inclusive education, creating behavioural change towards children with disabilities, and increasing learning opportunities for children with disabilities as well as those from ethnic minorities. Partnerships with MECSS, development partners and civil society organizations have been successfully established and used to implement activities.
However, there is still room for improvement in enhancing effectiveness and ensuring the sustainability of the programme. For instance, further efforts are needed to ensure that the concept of inclusive education is translated into pedagogical practices and learning outcomes. More support is needed in translating inclusive education policies into action and strengthening EMIS to enhance the monitoring system, particularly for children from vulnerable groups, both in and outside of the school system. UNICEF efforts, thus far, have focused on piloting a model for inclusive education in target areas and developing relevant policies and regulations. Moving forward, more focus will be placed on supporting the Government to ensure implementation of these policies.
It was also observed from the programme implementation process that there is no common understanding and interpretation of inclusive education among different stakeholders in Mongolia, which often leads to debate and argument during meetings and discussions, affecting the effectiveness and quality of the initiatives. Also, lack of coordination among development partners could be seen as another weakness, where MECSS’ lead is essential to avoid duplication and ensure complementarity of different donor organizations’ investments and efforts. It was also evident that local government commitment in terms of human resources and funding is critical to sustainability of the initiatives, particularly in the target areas.
Moving forward, UNICEF will continue to support the development of inclusive education, particularly for children with disabilities. Several policies, regulations and/or Minister’s orders in support of mainstreaming children with disabilities in regular schools have been issued recently. It is essential that UNICEF supports MECSS in ensuring implementation of these policies in 2020–2021..
In relation to system strengthening, MECSS, with UNICEF support, recently commenced a study/research to examine basic concepts and terminology used around inclusive education in Mongolia. This research, which will conclude in early 2020, will help ensure a common understanding of inclusive education and interpretation of terminology around it. Recommendations from this study will inform the Education Law (currently under revision) and other relevant policies on inclusive education. UNICEF support for the EMIS system will continue to integrate data on children with disabilities. It was agreed that the MICS 2018 methodology for the disability functioning module will be used to expand EMIS with data on disability.
Regarding partnership and coordination among donors, at the initiative of the Japan International Cooperation Agency and UNICEF, key stakeholders and partners including MECSS have recently set up a coordination mechanism to discuss and exchange ideas and experience and to improve the complementarity of each other’s work. For instance, MECSS sees UNICEF-supported Child Development Centres as a good model and is planning to replicate this model in 21 provinces with World Bank support in the next two years.
2. Innovation
Throughout the winter of 2018/2019, UNICEF continued its ger innovation challenge to improve energy efficiency in traditional homes (gers) to reduce air pollution caused by the burning of coal in these gers. With support from international and local partners (Arc’Teryx, The North Face, University of Pennsylvania and KieranTimberlake Architects, Gerhub), a number of prototypes were designed, constructed and tested and their performance was monitored in real time throughout the winter of 2018/2019. The results were promising.
Building on the results, UNICEF together with the Bayankhongor government, Mongolian University of Sciences and Technology (MUST) and the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN) and the local private sector and community, developed clean and efficient “CHIPS”: Cooking Heating, Insulation Products and Services. As described in the results section, the objective of the CHIPS package is to support all 6,000 ger households in the Bayankhongor provincial centre to replace their coal stoves with clean and efficient electric cooking and heating, supported by good insulation and ventilation. There is growing interest from other provinces and Ulaanbaatar to learn more about CHIPS and try it out. If there would be a substantial demand beyond Bayankhongor, it would likely be possible to significantly reduce production costs and thus make it more affordable.
To date, 200 households have received the CHIPS package and the initial response from the end users has been very positive. In 8 gers, real time energy performance and indoor air quality monitoring sensors were installed and electricity consumption and bills are closely monitored as well. These data will provide key insights in the performance of CHIPS and affordability of electricity bills.
In partnership with Washington University of St Louis (WUSTL) and MUST, UNICEF installed a high-end air quality monitoring station in Bayankhongor. This reference grade station measures pm2.5 levels hourly throughout the year. Initial data (November–December) show that pm2.5 levels in Bayankhongor are equal to and frequently higher than in Ulaanbaatar, highlighting the urgent need for action. The reference station is also being used to develop an innovative low-cost approach to citywide air quality monitoring: six different brands of low-cost monitoring devices are tested against the reference station to assess if any of the devices can produce reliable measurements in the extreme environmental conditions of Mongolia (extremely high levels of pollution, extreme temperatures in summer and winter). Initial data indicate two low-cost devices show promising results. Final conclusions are expected to arrive mid-2020.
"
EAPR,Myanmar,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Two major evaluations this year contributed to important lessons learned that will guide future programming. The first is the formative evaluation of the Maternal and Child Cash Transfer (MCCT) programme. This country-led evaluation was designed to produce lessons learned from the initial phase of the programme, in Chin and Rakhine, which could then inform the planned scale up of the programme countrywide. The MCCT is the flagship social protection programme of the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement, so the evaluation also has wider applicability to inform other national social protection initiatives. The evaluation produced four key recommendations:

Integration and coordination amongst different departments and ministries needs to be strengthened through clearer designation of roles and responsibilities.
Investment should be made into IT-based options to replace paper-based systems, to better facilitate management of larger beneficiary databases, process timely payments and support monitoring and evaluation.
Since the broader aim of the MCCT is to improve nutritional status of children and mothers, more work is required on the social and behavioural change communications (SBCC) package,  to ensure better understanding by the various communities in a culturally and ethnically diverse context. As well as targeting pregnant women and young mothers, the SBCC package should target and involve male community members, to promote and gender appropriate and shared approach to child wellbeing.
Limited operations funds and shortages of field personnel caused implementation gaps that reduced effectiveness and efficiency. Certain key responsibilities were neglected. This needs immediate attention if the scale up is to be effective.
These recommendations were validated by the various partners supporting MCCT. In 2020, MCCT will expand to the two most populous areas of the country: Ayeyarwady Region and Shan State, so the results of the evaluation are crucial to ensure a successful scale up.
The second evaluation was on the non-formal middle school education programme (NFMSE). According to the 2014 census over 2 million children age 13-17 are missing out on schooling. Non-formal approaches aimed at bringing children back into education and/or providing them with skills that will equip them for adult life. Thus, the findings of the evaluation will make a key contribution to the Government's scale up plans for alternative education options. The key findings of the evaluation were that NFMSE was:

Relevant to the education goals, priorities and policies of the MoE and the needs of out-of-school children in Myanmar. 
Effective in ensuring vulnerable children receive an opportunity to complete middle school.
Efficient in achieving its outputs and has demonstrated an effective partnership model applicable in increasing access to middle school equivalency education for vulnerable children
These findings help justify the launch of the alternative education policy framework, which includes opportunities for private, non-state service providers to also take up roles and support the introduction of NFMSE in areas where government may not be able to immediately expand to.
Air pollution is an important emerging area for UNICEF programming. UNICEF worked with partners to host the first Partner Meeting on Air Pollution, which took place in Yangon in May. The UNICEF Mongolia Representative participated in the event, to share experience and help shape the way forward. UNICEF and U Reporters partnered with UNDP /EU/Oredoo/Connect University/West Yangon University for several days of outreach for 2019’s World Environment Day focused on the theme “Beat Air Pollution”. UNICEF and Save the Children facilitated the participation of key Government staff from ministries responsible for health and the environment to attend a regional conference on air pollution and child health, which took place in Mongolia in October. A scoping study on air pollution was carried out and the results will be presented in early 2020, to help shape the future action plan.
One exciting innovation developed during the year was the 'Banana Bag'. This initiative, supported by a generous donation from the Shenzhen World Health Foundation, initially considered the introduction of the 'Baby Box' concept, as used in several other countries around the world. However, intensive participatory engagement with mothers of young children led to rethinking the concept, to be more focused on promoting good nutrition practices at the time of introducing complementary feeding after the 6-month period of exclusive breast feeding. The Banana Bag, which doubles as a play mat, contains several items to promote and support such practices. Protypes have been produced, piloted and will now be refined and made ready for larger scale production and distribution in 2020.
UNICEF also supported innovation through its partnership with Telenor, to introduce electronic Vital Registration (eVR), including the use of tablet-based birth and death registration by front-line health staff. This is being piloted in Mon State and the feedback from the health staff is encouraging. Midwives use the tablets to collect/share vital data with the Township Medical Officer, who then reviews data online and issue the certificate. The mobile system allows for faster and safer registration, while reaching more children.
The process for the preparation of the revised CPMP, as mentioned in Section 2, included a review of programme strategies, to ensure that the resulting management plan matched the required programme direction. It was found that the programme strategies remained relevant in addressing key child rights issues in the country. However, the limited full-time presence of UNICEF in the capital Nay Pyi Taw meant less than optimal engagement with government counterparts. Also, it was found that UNICEF's field presence was not being used as effectively as it might, with recommendations regarding greater delegation of authority to the field level, improved clarity over roles and responsibilities of field and country office staff, and improved methods for tracking budgets and expenditure at field level. The subsequent CPMP has addressed these issues and mechanisms will be put in place to operationalize the management decisions in 2020.

EAPR,Papua New Guinea,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Leveraging Partnerships and Advocacy: PNG’s WASH sector is in the foundational stage in-terms of establishing institutional arrangements, service provision and building a WASH technical workforce. Government and external partners’ have experience limited to their respective operational locations. Although PNG’s National WASH Policy catalysed collaborative efforts to provide direction to the sector, public investment for WASH services improvements is lacking. UNICEF’s partnerships strategy was key to progressing the WASH sector agenda. UNICEF partnered with international CSOs and key Government institutions to deliver results for women and children. Through this modality, some local Governments financially contributed to improve WASH services as a demonstration of their commitment towards programme sustainability.
Recognizing that a qualified social service workforce is the first line of response for children and families and the most important element of a well-functioning child protection system, UNICEF has been supporting OCFS to lay the foundations for LPA-mandated child protection workforce. With UNICEF’s technical assistance, OCFS established a Working Committee on Child Protection Case Management overseeing the completion of the Child Protection Case Management Minimum Standards and the Case Management Handbook, to ensure that case workers (including CPOs) met minimum qualification standards. This ensured Government ownership and buy-in providing an advocacy tool. In building a social services workforce, Government-led working committees are an invaluable tool to provide strategic advocacy and coordination and advance the child protection agenda.
Evidence-based advocacy is key to spearheading the child protection programme and achieving results for children. Based on UNICEF’s assessment, the Working Committee members recognized the critical knowledge and skills gaps of CPOs. This led to advocacy with OCFS management to institutionalize the Standards and Handbook and the partnership with PILAG.
High level advocacy with politicians and decision makers at national and provincial level is the driving tool to improve the ownership and resource allocation for health service delivery and achieve of Universal Health Coverage.
Innovation: Traditionally school WASH infrastructure lacked comprehensive planning and implementation. In most schools, latrines and water taps are discretely located and handwashing facilities are rare, with no clear link to a whole school learning environment. Under the EU-UNICEF WASH project innovative WASH facility designs were developed and aligned with national standards for WASH in Schools. These designs are inclusive, gender segregated to ensure privacy/security and age appropriate. WASH facilities are planned as integrated blocks combining latrines with handwashing facilities, MHM room and incinerators. For health centres, WASH facilities design integrated solar panels to power a water pump and vaccine cold chain equipment. All designs come with a bill of quantities and costing based on current market rates analysis. Thus, the approach to institutional WASH services is resulting in standardized designs and market costs that are nationally acceptable by Government.
Despite progress, nutrition reporting is a challenge with inconsistent nutrition care services in most provinces. A new online data collection platform, developed by UNICEF, is tracking monthly nutrition reporting to support NDoH in capturing all required indicators. This online data collection platform uses Kobo Toolbox to digitize formerly manual data collection feeding into Power B.I. for automated data generation and analysis. The data collection system is being integrated into the National Health Information System.
The SLSS programme delivered an innovative package of services promoting hypothermia management in preterm low birth weight babies and preventing post-partum haemorrhage for mothers who encounter prolonged second stage of birth, including use of hypothermia alert device and non-pneumatic anti-shock garment.
Positive social norms, community mobilization and ownerships: The CLTS approach proved a strong entry point for mobilizing community members for positive hygiene behaviour change. Throughout project districts, communities welcomed and readily shifted to the new normal of improved sanitation and hygiene practices. Community members utilized local materials in building household VIP latrines and tippy taps. Communities formed vigilance committees to monitor ‘ODF’ status. Their cooperative efforts are channelled to rapidly transition to healthy communities by incorporating various aspects such as solid liquid resource management and environment beautification.
UNICEF used U-Report, a platform for the public to express their concerns, for various programmes including promotion of immunization. Having implemented the Polio-MR campaign, provinces now better understand the role of health promotion in creating demand for immunization and other health services.
Capacity Development: Maintaining nutrition-specific services at sub-national levels is still a struggle as health workers are not actively integrating nutrition services in their daily routine care. Therefore, thoroughly explaining during mentorship and on-job coaching visits the importance of nutrition services alongside other health care services improves their understanding greatly. Leadership and capacity of PHAs during mentorship and monitoring visits are critical. Approaches of capacity development embedded in the National Nutrition Policy and integration of nutrition service delivery into routine health services was found to be effective.
Integrated approaches: To design service delivery arrangements for WASH a common agent/agency proved beneficial. The consultative process resulted in Government departments and WASH stakeholders working to identify existing service delivery mechanisms and barriers then define mechanisms for progressing WASH service delivery from national to local Government level and vice versa, creating a feedback loop integral to results-based management.
At the district level, the use of village cluster approach and local motivators in delivering WASH services proved successful. CSOs field functionaries deliver WASH services in a cluster consisting of a school, health facility and surrounding communities with help from a local motivator. The consistent approach promoted quicker local ownership of WASH interventions and behaviour change.
Due to frequent demand from certain provinces requesting for nutrition supplies, it was agreed by NDoH that provinces implementing nutrition interventions should be prioritized in supply provision, including provincial hospitals that are contributing to the annual paediatric report. This avoids wastage of supplies in provinces/health facilities that are not implementing nutrition interventions. Integration of nutrition services (e.g. Vitamin A Supplementation) with routine immunization outreach and mobile sessions was critical in 2019 and can be strengthened with the Accelerated Immunization and Health System Strengthening programme currently rolled out in 12 provinces in PNG.
Establishment of Emergency Operations Centres and other coordination mechanisms at national/subnational levels is an opportunity to ensure strengthened Supplementary and Routine Immunization planning, implementation and monitoring.
"
EAPR,Philippines,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"With a greater focus on adolescents and youth in the new country programme, several initiatives were launched in 2019.
In June, UNICEF and its partners launched U-Report in the Philippines, specifically in BARMM. It comes at an important time during the region’s transition period which presents unique opportunities to empower children and adolescents to influence the development of policies, plans and budgets that can improve their situation. 
In the first-ever U-Report poll in the country, adolescents and youth in BARMM reported their biggest concerns in education and livelihood opportunities, ranking higher than their concerns related to violence and armed conflict. To address these concerns, U-Reporters recommended that the regional government improve and expand services and support initiatives and advocacy for adolescents and youth.
The annual target of 5,000 U-Reporters for the reporting year was met and around 80 per cent of registered U-reporters took part in each poll. The results of five U-Report polls fed directly into the formulation of the new Bangsamoro Youth Agenda finalized in August and into the preparation of the Call to Action by children and adolescents against which the BARMM Government responded though its adoption of Resolution 48 at a Special Parliamentary Session on Children’s Rights.
The enrolment of U-reporters quickly spiked to 3,000 following the June launch but slowed down in the last quarter of the year due to funding limitations. To sustain the early momentum and meet the target, U-Report promotion was included in other activities such as the 30th anniversary of the CRC. The initiative will continue to engage U-Reporters in upcoming activities such as engaging religious leaders, training youth volunteers by the Office on Bangsamoro Youth Affairs, and training teachers for Alternative Learning System.  
In November 20, U-Reporters were actively involved in celebrating the 30th anniversary of the CRC and will continue to play an important role in following the progress on the Children’s Declaration and the provisions of Resolution 48 passed by BARMM Parliament. The U-Report polls provided real-time information to the BARMM government, specifically the Office on the Bangsamoro Youth Affairs (OBYA) in developing the Bangsamoro Youth Agenda and the programs of the Ministries of Higher, Basic and Technical Education, and of Social Services and Development. 
“U-Report is an exciting innovation to help us understand the concerns of youth and adolescents in BARMM. This tool can foster open communication and make sure that we prioritize issues that children and youth are passionate about,” said Dr. Marjanie Mimbantas Macasalong, Executive Director of OBYA.
Youth volunteers make up for limited resources in responding to the polio outbreak 
When faced with the herculean task of quickly and efficiently reaching the most vulnerable children during the polio outbreak amid lack of resources, UNICEF and DOH were able to count on youth volunteers. These volunteers worked with national and international NGOs, civil society organizations, and the whole UN Health Cluster partners – Philippine Red Cross, Rotary International, Health Organization of Mindanao – in community mobilization, vaccination and monitoring of the polio outbreak response.
More than 1,000 youth volunteers from various universities in Manila, from Cavite State University and St. Edward Integrated School-Cavite, and from the Positive Youth Development Network (PYDN) were given orientation, mobilized and deployed as vaccinators, recorders, educators and monitors to do Rapid Coverage Assessments (RCA) during the polio outbreak campaign in various communities and areas.
The PYDN is a group of youth volunteers from Unilab Foundation who handles various health projects and groups all over the country. UNICEF Philippines engaged the volunteers for the measles outbreak to do RCAs and because they have experienced conducting such, they were once again engaged to help in the polio outbreak RCA and to be part of the vaccination teams.
The volunteers from Cavite joined the vaccination drive through a UNICEF staff with the Health and Nutrition section who invited them to help be part of the vaccination teams and to conduct RCAs. They also served as trainers/educators for other members of the teams. The volunteers also helped significantly by printing their own campaign shirts and IDs.
UNICEF and DOH conducted a Training of Trainers to prepare youth leaders to train other volunteers. The first group of trainees were composed of 25 from PYDN and Cavite State University, 30 from various universities in Manila, and 39 from St. Edward School conducted a series of trainings which resulted in more than 1,000 volunteers in the National Capital Region by the end of the campaign. They were all deployed mostly in the hard-to-reach and densely populated slum areas.
This experience is a testament to the power of volunteerism especially when help is needed most. In this case, during a national health crisis where the volunteers had the potential to contract the disease, but it did not hinder their commitment to help.
Neither UNICEF nor DOH offered incentives to the volunteers, but they will be given recognition through certificates of participation at the end of the campaign.

EAPR,Thailand,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The overarching goal of UNICEF’s Country Programme is to contribute to national efforts to enable all children in Thailand, especially the most disadvantaged and excluded, to have their rights progressively fulfilled, developing their full potential in an inclusive and protective society.  The Country Programme contributes to the Government’s vision articulated in the 12th National Economic and Social Development Plan (NESDP) and to the outcome strategies of the United Nations Partnerships Framework (UNPAF) 2017-2021. The Country Management Team undertook a review of the Country Programme in 2019 (the “mid-term review” or “MTR”) and established the following goals:  

Articulation of a longer-term vision aligned with the Government of Thailand’s 20-year National Strategy.  
Assessment of results achieved at mid-term of the programme cycle and a review of the validity of the programme logic and priorities. 
Sharpening and elevation of the strategic focus of the Country Programme in line with national and global priorities. 
Ensure that programme results and strategies are strategically aligned with UNICEF’s Strategic Plan 2018-2021, Second Decade Programming Guidelines and the Global Education Strategy 2019-2030.
Prioritization of changes in the programme and operational environment and their programme implications: delivering better results while maintaining the same level of resources.  
An over-arching theory of change linking all programme outcomes was developed in line with the identified long-term vision, as well as an updated delivery model, as laid out in the foregoing sections.
The MTR confirmed the continued need to strengthen coherence of the programme to link the first and the second decades, especially to address inter-generational cycles of inequity and deprivation, and to reinforce the systems building approach to ensure sustainability of efforts towards building an inclusive and protective society and contributing to human capital development. The experience and partnerships gained from the Country Programme demonstrate the relevance of not only national but also sub-national level engagement with government. 
In specific programme areas, the following strategic shifts were agreed. Early Childhood Development (ECD) will see a greater focus on reducing inequities by further evidence generation on the drivers of malnutrition. Education will focus on scaling up inclusive and equitable access models for mother tongue transition to Thai learning, remote rural communities, and migrant children. Child Protection (CP) will engage in more complex and higher-level systems building and policy advocacy to support the government to develop a vision of the CP system and its implementation. Priority issues for adolescents are cross cutting and a strengthened and reinvigorated focus will be put on second decade programme, both increasing its scope and elevating its engagement to systems building. Social Policy will increasingly play the lead role for strategic policy and public finance engagement on behalf of the office with the government’s strategic planning bodies, to ensure coordination and to amplify the synergies and complementary roles of all sectoral programmes. Social Protection will focus on capitalizing the success of the child support grant to strengthen the network of social services for disadvantaged children. 
The MTR process included an analysis of all demonstration projects implemented during 2017-2019 to understand their alignment with strategic priorities of the Country Programme. This analysis found that 65 percent of projects had clear scale up strategies from inception, while the remaining 35 percent had not. This analysis contributed to recommendations of handing over approximately 40 percent of ongoing demonstration projects to the government. These included capacity building of health professionals on the breastmilk substitute code in ECD, the Swimsafe initiative in education and development of HIV PrEP operational guidelines for adolescents. All of these had involved government participation in the initial design, contributing to their sustainability.
While the Country Programme document 2017-2021 does not articulate a clear geographical focus, apart from the child protection programme which targets the conflict-affected Deep South, prioritisation on where to work has been defined and led by the equity focus of the programme. UNICEF Thailand’s pilot and demonstration projects collectively operate in nearly all provinces in Thailand, however with little coordination among them.  
In future, the Country Programme will need a greater geographic convergence and coherence of programmatic interventions in prioritized provinces reducing the number of demonstration model sites and the need for resources dedicated to decentralized level modelling across all programmes. Capacity building at local level to better leverage local government funds and ensure sustainability will be prioritized.  
An area-based approach will be defined with target areas selected based on evidence (e.g.: MICS provincial data). To avoid overloading local authorities, support for capacity building, planning and monitoring must be ensured. Given that 35 percent of the national budget should in principle be allocated through local authorities, there is an opportunity to engage and leverage local-level decision makers to invest in priority areas for children.  A detailed analysis on the structure and function of the local administration needs be undertaken to decide the level of decentralisation for UNICEF focus.   
The MTR concluded on the need for the office to strengthen its advocacy capacity by adopting and implementing a change management process, with stronger coordination and guidance capacity to bring better coherence in programmatic policy and public advocacy efforts to harness the power of mobilizing public support for the cause of children. Strengthened internal capacity and resources will ensure that public campaigns are part of a measurable longer-term strategy with robust audience insights, M&E, and comprehensive supporter engagement.
The creation of a private partnerships section with matrix management between PSFR and Programme will bring together staff working in financial and non-financial partnerships including all corporate fundraisers, philanthropy, NextGen and Corporate Responsibility and Business Principles (CRBP). The creation of this section is in alignment with the global direction for B4R. The team focus will be on opportunities to promote corporate pathway to pledge (CP2P) grants, customer fundraising, cause related marketing and other donations. The office will move to a new customer relationship marketing (CRM) (Salesforce) in 2020 and start using complex audience marketing tools (marketing cloud) for both financial and non-financial supporters. Reporting and analytics will be improved to help the individual giving, volunteer and digital donor teams develop more strategic planning.

EAPR,Timor-Leste,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Uncertainty continued to be a dominant government feature in 2019, with a late start of the government budget implementation negatively impacting the coverage of social sector interventions. Similar constraints are expected in 2020, with significant uncertainties around the proposed 2020 budget and therefore the viability of the current government. While change and uncertainty within government led to some implementation challenges in 2019, it also provided opportunities to advance on cross sectoral issues. Moving forward, expanding alliances with CSOs, especially local ones, and with the private sector, could be a way forward to partly mitigate the impact of long-term political instability on programming.
Partnerships remain key toward successful programme implementation, with partnerships expanding with a range of UN partner agencies, CSOs and development partners in the areas of law and policy development, community engagement, adolescents, gender and violence against women, girls and children. Leveraging partnerships with high-profile organizations and institutions has shown to be beneficial in obtaining access to and advocate with high-level officials. For instance, in the nutrition sector, UNICEF engagement with a range of partners and the Prime Minister’s Office has opened a new avenue to advocate for allocation of resources for children.
While UNICEF continues to support a broad range of programmes to expand access and quality to care and services for children, partner capacities remain an obstacle to scaling up and sustainability. As an example, the parenting programme has been well accepted by communities and local officials, but current capacities and lack of government resources create challenges in its expansion. UNICEF and partners are taking these constraints into account both in the design and implementation phase of programming, working to develop workable models within existing capacities and expanding capacities as needed. 
Recent years have seen increased engagement at community level, in both modeling innovative programming and in social and behavior change. Active engagement of local leaders has facilitated stronger community participation in programming, but increased engagement at the design and planning levels has been shown to have a much greater impact and community ownership. Decisions, such as who will perform construction work and which community members can best facilitate activities, can have a large influence on community buy-in and ownership.
2019 saw increased participation and partnership with adolescents and youth, particularly through nation-wide engagement for the situation analysis of children (SITAN). The large-scale adolescent consultations around the SITAN integrated several innovations: they were conducted by youth facilitators and artists; facilitators’ training included a session on ethical research involving children; consultations integrated real-time data collection through Kobo Collect; workshops were independently monitored by youth group members in three municipalities; and workshops integrated drawing, videos and theatre for adolescents to express their situation and act out the change they would like to see. In the end, not all these innovations were successful. The youth facilitators had excellent facilitation skills, but limited analytical/synthesis capacity, which resulted in UNICEF taking on time-consuming data entry and analysis. Similarly, some of the drawings produced by young artists provided powerful illustrations of the situation and desired change, but the video and theatre activities did not yield the expected outputs. These are useful lessons – on the need to strengthen youth group’s analytical capacities, and to provide guidance and possibly cameras/tablets to ensure better audiovisual products.
Another lesson learned through engagement with adolescents was that while adolescents pointed to many expected issues, their causality analysis at times differed from UNICEF’s. Their analysis also showed how interconnected issues were, requiring UNICEF to rethink its positioning in some areas, and to work with partners to ensure that matters of significance to adolescents are acted upon. Finally, adolescents see themselves as change makers, as evidenced by recommendations addressed to their age groups rather than to adults, showing that supporting their actions, and not just their participation, should be prioritized.
UNICEF strengthened its level of engagement with the field in 2019 and gained valuable insights. In particular, field monitoring helped UNICEF identify challenges in the application of new knowledge and skills provided through trainings. In some areas, it also pointed to limited ownership and maintenance of UNICEF-supported programmes both by the Government and community. Altogether, it highlighted the necessity and value of regular monitoring, but also pointed to the need to establish more systematic partnerships at the local level to sustain dialogue and feedback loops. Taking advantage of innovative technology and participatory approaches could provide a way forward.
While a system is in place for monitoring the implementation of the National Child Action Plan, it is insufficient to spur strong follow-up, due to the gradually lower institutional positioning of the Commission on the Rights of the Child and to the low priority given to this action plan. This points to the need for high-level advocacy, but also calls for greater engagement with civil society and other partners, to diversify and amplify calls to prioritize children’s issues.
Building on the 30th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and utilizing key tools such as the UNICEF Café helped raise the profile of child rights across arrange of stakeholders in government, development partners, children, adolescents and youth. In addition, in a country where access to information remains an important challenge, the expansion of partnerships with community radios has helped reach more communities, children and families across Timor-Leste with messaging on nutrition, immunization, birth registration, education, prevention of violence against children, and water, sanitation and hygiene.
Data use remains a central challenge, with a wealth of statistics and analyses remaining under-used in decision-making. The production of visual, comprehensive products can be a good practice in this regard, as evidenced by requests from Parliamentarians to obtain copies of the SDG Child Databook publication to support the 2020 State budget debate. This publication owed its appeal to the visual representation of statistics, with infographics, graphs and charts, and to its comprehensive nature, as it compiled all key child statistics related to the SDGs.

EAPR,Vietnam,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"One of the objectives of UNICEF’s 2019 MTR was to highlight lessons learnt and emerging opportunities to reach those children furthest behind and deliver results at scale.
The first lesson, achieving the planned outcomes of the CP, will require shifts in how UNICEF works. UNICEF will work to transform its programmes to be more strategic, relevant and impactful. This means prioritizing fewer, more-focused results for children that lead to policy changes the government can implement at scale. The key opportunity for this is the two-year rolling work plan 2020-2021. This shift aligns with Viet Nam’s status as a lower-middle-income country, and UNICEF’s resource environment.
For delivering at scale, improved planning of pilot projects will be introduced, with greater focus on evaluation, costing and securing government commitment up front to take pilots to scale. UNICEF looks to government to take increased ownership of and responsibility for service delivery and quality assurance in programme areas where major UNICEF assistance is no longer required. During the last two years of the CP, the Country Office will evaluate and consolidate pilots under the key programmes, including IECD, CFCI and child-friendly courts, to come up with optimum models and detailed guidance for further scale up.
Another lesson will see UNICEF and government enhance the equity focus of the programmes bymaking the case for increased public investment in human capital. This will be based on strong data, evidence and analysis of the root causes of ongoing challenges faced by children being left behind (e.g. ethnic minorities, children with disabilities, and children affected by internal migration) and human trafficking. UNICEF’s strategic advocacy will target policy makers and the public with messages on the costs and major public and private returns of investing adequately and early in areas such as early childhood care, water quality and sanitation, especially for disadvantaged groups, and on how to expand partnerships, including working with the private sector for increased resources for children’s programmes. A self-critical, independent gender assessment of UNICEF’s programme and approaches indicated several areas for stronger, better targeted gender sensitive approaches. It also indicated that UNICEF has some excellent gender aware work – but is failing to reach donors and others with information and evidence of this work.
The MTR concluded that in the current context of Viet Nam, policy change and results at scale for children, especially for disadvantaged groups, will not be achieved without addressing challenges of climate change and air pollution, urbanization, and adolescent development and participation.These areas will get additional attention within the framework of the current CP. Emphasis will be on knowledge generation, testing new programme approaches and building new partnerships, leading  to the development of the next CPD.
For more effective policy influencing and results at scale, the Office is reviewing and revamping its advocacy plan usinglessons from the last three years. For example, in 2019, UNICEF successfully influenced the SPC Judicial Resolution on sexual violence and adjudication procedures for cases of sexual violence against children. One of the lessons that enabled the success was UNICEF’s flexibility to seize opportunities aligned with its core advocacy. Leveraging the increased attention on child sexual abuse, the office re-focused planned policy dialogues and the online training, to the specific issue of handling child sexual abuse cases. As a result, UNICEF was able to attract the engagement of the Chief Justice of the SPC. UNICEF engaged the Family Court of Australia (FCA), pro-bono, to share expertise and experiences with the SPC and wider justice sector actors. In this way, UNICEF was able to demonstrate its value by securing high-level expertise and brokering an institution-to-institution relationship for more cost-effective capacity building.
To ensure UNICEF is fit for purpose and engaging in more dynamic and innovative partnerships, Technology for Development (T4D) emerged as a demand from several programmes that are improving their reach with apps, online tools, databases, etc. For example, the Disability Survey used apps to disseminate knowledge and data to much larger audiences, many of whom live in hard-to-reach areas. Online training has become the norm for many sectors, reaching tens of thousands of government officials in provinces, and providing flexibility and efficiency for large-scale capacity building. Online training has been done effectively under the Child Protection Programme, which was scaled up by the government using its own resources.
For expanded impact with limited resources, it is critical to invest in building UNICEF’s influence and brand positioning. The following areas were identified as critical enablers for achieving equitable results for children: clear advocacy priorities, with a combination of planned campaigns and sharper focus on engagement and identification of influencers; targeted Communication for Development that addresses social norms and behaviours; the need to build brand; grow partner engagement, including actively partnering with media and corporate partners; strengthen knowledge management and enhance donor visibility; and plan for and increase digital capacity and outreach.
2020 is a pivotal year in Viet Nam, with the country leadership preparing for its new strategic planning cycle and the Party Congress in 2021. While there are delays in decision making and programme activities due to government personnel changes, the new planning cycle will benefit from UNICEF’s in-depth analysis of child-related issues and evidence-based solutions and priorities to address them. Viet Nam will have to make great efforts to achieve the SDGs by 2030, including on nutrition, quality of secondary education and child protection, ensuring no child is left behind.
Viet Nam will chair ASEAN in 2020, representing not only a major opportunity for Viet Nam to showcase its successes in poverty reduction and child rights implementation, but also to learn from other countries and promote joint approaches in the region. UNICEF will work closely with the EAPRO to seize this opportunity to advance its regional priorities on children, including addressing issues related to migration, children trafficking, urbanization, social welfare workforce strengthening, and education for the 21st Century.
"
ECAR,Albania,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"There has been a minor slow-down in programme implementation because of the resignation of opposition parties from Parliament in February 2019 and the subsequent local elections in June that were also boycotted by the opposition. In recognition of the government’s strong drive towards EU accession, UNICEF CO, throughout 2019, continued to support GoA in moving forward the reforms. The main focus was to progressively align the national legislation, policies and action plans with EU accession priorities and the 2030 Agenda. However, there continues to be low budget allocation for the social sectors, a determining factor for success of reforms in these areas and for Albania to reach the standards of the EU and other countries in the region.
There has been no change in the data gaps of 2018; these continue to remain a critical barrier to assessment of the extent to which new laws and policies have been implemented, and, most importantly, whether progress has been achieved in realisation of children’s rights. UNICEF has put in place efforts to strengthen the sub-national (municipal) systems to generate data on children. Consequently, statistics on children have been published for the municipalities of Korca and Shkodra, for at least 20 indicators, none of which had been previously published or accessible for policy makers.
Recognisant of its unique role in oversight of accountability, Albania’s Parliament has emerged as an important partner of UNICEF in the strengthening of governance for children. The parliamentarians’ Friends of Children Group was this year vocal on behalf of children and passed a Resolution on Children. In addition, it speeded up legislative changes to the USI law, despite strong lobbying from the food processing industry, and to the law on social and economic aid. Effective parliamentary engagement is a long-term process that needs to be integrated regularly into UNICEF CO’s programming.
The PISA results for Albania indicate the need for a renewed impetus towards improvement of learning outcomes, with a focus on science and reading (where the country’s performance was weakest), and with regard to the relative performance of boys and girls. UNICEF has already engaged in interventions aiming at a more qualitative and inclusive education with curricula reviews and design of training in inclusive education. Nevertheless, the need for more investment in differentiated learning practices and professional development in how to implement the new curricula based on competencies would need to be pursued more arduously by UNICEF.
Low quality education provided in small and remote schools using multi-grade teaching continues to be an issue for quality education, based upon the results of an assessment made available by MoESY. Rural children living in remote and isolated areas are provided with lower quality teaching due to a lack of training opportunities and resources and a shortage of qualified teachers. To boost improvement in children learning outcomes, UNICEF is testing implementation of a digital learning platform that provides digital support to facilitate delivery of the official curricula through making the process of teaching and learning more interactive and child centred.
With regard to early childhood development, no institutional anchor to coordinate across the different sectors exists in Albania. There is lack of definition of responsibilities cross the central and local levels following on from the process of decentralisation reform. While this reform has given increased powers to municipalities to plan and administer pre-school services, it, unfortunately, has not been accompanied by the needed financial transfers and mechanisms for implementation.
Reflecting on the numerous challenges facing UNICEF, the most complex concerns the work on law enforcements (mostly the prosecution) and the judiciary. This has been caused by the vetting process (part of the ongoing justice reform process in Albania), which side-lined a large part of the workforce from these two important stakeholder groups. Regardless of the agency’s efforts, the majority of strategic discussions, large-scale capacity building efforts and long-term investment plans have not scaled up. In response, UNICEF counterbalanced this situation with more in-depth technical work with specific groups of professionals, and investment in identification of sector ‘champions’. As a result, the three prosecutors (including the Chief Prosecutor of Tirana) who have been actively engaged in UNICEF efforts to address child online sexual abuse, facilitated establishment of a special task force to address the shortcomings of the system’s failure to response to cases of online sexual abuse of children.
In advancing the de-institutionalisation process, UNICEF managed to trigger a decisive political shift, as a result of which the government has openly committed to reorganising the child care system and end child institutionalisation. UNICEF addressed this issue first through coalition building efforts, gathering the most reputable local child care organisations and experts and enriching this group with high-level international expertise. This resulted in very strong advocacy efforts which made possible to fully revise the national de-institutionalisation action plan, which is now submitted for the approval of the Council of Ministers. The most important lesson learnt in the process was the ultimate significance of establishing a powerful coalition that, besides being a unified voice advocating a child’s right to a family environment, ensured strong local ownership of the process from the very outset.
In terms of innovative approaches, the web-based platform for psychological and mental health counselling deserves special recognition. In a less than six months, 1,996 people (mostly adolescents) benefited from the service. The voluntary work of professionals (doctors) willingly contributing a few hours of their time every week to providing this service is another very promising element in this initiative. UNICEF will expand its scope in 2020 to cover an additional group of key beneficiaries, namely victims or potential victims of human trafficking.
The strengthening of capacities of municipalities to plan, deliver and monitor services for children as required by their new mandates remains central to the reform agenda. Service delivery at the local level has been coupled with UNICEF’s advocacy at the central level to find solutions for sustainable 
financing of social care services through proposing a feasible financial mechanism so that funds from the central social protection budget can be channelled to local governments. A positive example in 2019 was UNICEF advocacy that resulted in allocation of an additional USD 1.5 million from the national social protection budget to fourteen municipalities for social care services for children and the vulnerable population.
In the pursuit of establishing grounds for a Child Friendly City (CFC) initiative as an entry point for introducing a more cross-sectoral perceptive in planning and delivering services for children at the local level, UNICEF partnered with Korca Municipality, resulting in the first CFC Action Plan 2020–2021 at this level. Concurrently, the budget approved by the municipality for 2020 reflected additional investments to be made in more playgrounds, green spaces and implementation of the Child Friendly Hotel and Restaurant initiative for ten private businesses. The last of these is an innovative approach to transforming premises into child-friendly spaces and providing minimum criteria for safety, play and healthy eating.
In health sector restructuring, a National Operator of the Health Services was established with overall responsibility for the management of the health services in Albania. While the regional and district operator structures introduced rationalisation of the health sector management and integration of primary, secondary and public health services under single management, they also created in short-term delays in obtaining necessary clearances and finalisation of joint activities, as new lines of responsibility and management approaches were introduced. To ensure timely implementation and sustainability of interventions, it has been crucial to gain a clear understanding of the functions of this new structure and how to involve the operator early in the planning, implementation and monitoring processes.
For the legislative and policy reforms to have a lasting positive impact on children’s lives, the scope should be taken further and used to generate a shift in perception in Albanian society, where not only policy makers, but also the community at large, as well as particular professionals working with children—teachers, doctors, law enforcement officials and social workers—view them as individual rights holders, and empower them and their families to claim their rights. To this end, public dialogue on child rights, awareness raising and dissemination of information concerning the CRC and child rights-related domestic legislation are needed.
Last, but not least, 26th November earthquake has demonstrated weak national response capacities and coordination. Therefore, UNICEF is investing increased resources to strengthen emergency preparedness and disaster risk reduction focusing on education, child protection and risk-response social protection system.
 
"
ECAR,Armenia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In a number of areas there are important lessons learned, smaller and bigger, which should be considered for future planning. The key lesson seems to be about staff capacity to respond and benefit fully from the multiple new opportunities created in a fast-changing environment and dynamic partnerships with the wide range of partners.
Working in the environment of multiple and fast policy changes
In 2019 UNICEF in Armenia worked in a radically changed policy development environment, with new Government partners who were committed to introduce changes in all spheres of development and human rights.. The Government Cabinet that was formed at the beginning of 2019, after a landslide victory on the parliamentary elections, was quickly faced with high, often unrealistic expectations of the general public in terms of improvement of the living conditions. On the other side, very ambitious plans to embark on multiple reforms, change policies and strategies were sometimes met with resistance. UNICEF staff and modest budget were stretched in order to respond to these simultaneous and extraordinary opportunities, adjustment were needed  to respond  quickly, putting UNICEF standard procedures at test.
New impetus to business sector and diaspora engagement
Another important lesson learned for the CO was a great success in engaging CEOs and owners of successful business entities in UNICEF Business Advisory Board. While earlier attempts to approach private sector for fundraising were not very successful, because UNICEF and the rest of UN are primarily perceived as donors in the Armenian society, the response to this new and different role was very positive. All Advisory Board members expressed their readiness to engage fully on the benefit of children, bringing in their expertise, influence and other resources. In particular the potential to innovate for children and with involvement of adolescents has been significantly increased. At the same time, after several years of exploring, there seems to be a much greater openness to engage with the Armenian diaspora. The challenge for UNICEF is to dedicate sufficient staff capacity to respond and harness these positive new developments. 
UN working together
In the year of important changes in terms of UN Reform, UNICEF CO continued developing joint programmes and initiatives with other agencies. While valuable results were achieved, there were also challenges and lessons learned. Different capacities, workstyles and sometimes different regulations require additional time to resolve. Working with 5 other agencies on human security proves to be the most challenging for the mere factor of communicating and coordinating actions in the selected communities.https://www.un.org/humansecurity/whats-new/
However, the joint programme “Future Today” was a particular test for the capacity of CO, since UNICEF has the leading role and bringing together all the actors presented enormous strain on staff time. A small but very positive example was the enhanced joint work with UNDP on GenU and GirlTech initiatives, where it was clear that even with modest resources the potential for impact can be demonstrated.
UNICEF continued as the lead agency on behalf of UN as co-chair of the extended UN Gender Thematic Group, together with the MOLSA and the WB. The Group was very active in 2019 and became more operative, three subgroups were created on prevention and services for domestic violence victims, women’s economic empowerment and voice and agency for women. The strong engagement on gender issues was time-consuming, however it greatly contributed to positioning UNICEF as a relevant actor in this area.
Innovative use of technology
In terms of innovative technology-based solutions, the CO considered development of an application to support healthy life-style of children, however the cost was too high. GirlTech pilot project demonstrated a very good potential, showing that girls age 10-15 can quickly learn programming and come up with creative solutions. This approach should be pursued, funding permitting. In partnership with Enterprise Incubator Foundation an initial phase of consultations is taking place, concerning assistive technologies and approaches to engage children and adolescents with disabilities in the UpShift-type of work. Again, capacity of programme staff to engage in technology-based solutions and their co-creation needs to be upgraded.
While these nurtured and expanded partnerships certainly contributed to UNICEF visibility and reputation as the lead agency for children in Armenia, from the management point of view the question of staff capacities and work-life balance was often reflected on. Some areas would require stronger investment in learning (such as private sector partnerships/ Business for Results), while it is also necessary to consider the workload more realistically to sustain the pace and the impact.
"
ECAR,Azerbaijan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In a context where economic development continues to dominate the national agenda, UNICEF has strived to forge partnerships with national and international actors in support of advocacy for critical social investments. In addition to ongoing partnerships, agreements were signed with the respected Heydar Aliyev Foundation to promote early childhood development, with the State Agency for Public Service and Social Innovations to promote child rights awareness with the public, with the Embassies of Italy and Belgium to challenge misconceptions over disability amongst children and with the Embassy of the Netherlands to promote girls’ equality. 
Institutional capacity strengthening remains key to sustainability of the investments being made in child and adolescent development, and this has been supported through UNICEF’s work in connecting international expertise with national partners and establishing additional partnerships with academic institutions in the areas of inclusive education, youth development, social work and data analysis. Partnerships with educational institutions should embed routine capacity strengthening into existing pre-service and in-service training and create a continuum of technical capacity amongst professionals in these sectors, year after year. Within the UNICEF Country Office, efforts were made to share knowledge and experience of staff with other countries in the region, including two Azerbaijani colleagues engaging in staff exchanges and technical missions to other UNICEF offices during the year. 
UNICEF continued its efforts to provide a robust evidence base for investment in children and young people, linked to the national focus on economic growth. A cost-benefit analysis of the integrated community-based social service model was started to make the case for the medium and long-term benefits of scaling up the social service workforce and social service provision to the most vulnerable populations. A formative evaluation of the School Readiness Programme will also provide evidence for more effective alternatives to expand the coverage of basic pre-school learning to all children. 
Efficiency and effectiveness have also underlined the investments made during the year in the NGO and civil society sector, through a European Union supported programme. The partnership with the EU has enabled UNICEF to expand collaboration with civil society partners to support the most vulnerable children and their families, while also offering management capacity support in areas such as financial planning and management, reporting, and prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse.  
The Country Office also benefited from expert guidance and strategic support from the UNICEF Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia, through visits by technical advisers in health, education, adolescent development, Technology for Development and social policy. This engagement supported the development of the new Country Programme vision and allowed for technical inputs to programme implementation. The Country Office also invited a visit by UNICEF’s Regional Staff Counsellor as part of its commitment to staff wellbeing. This range of support by regional experts allowed the Country Office to benefit from technical know-how and regional good practices that contributed to achieving better results for Azerbaijani children.
The Country Office ensured robust oversight of organizational financial, administrative, human resource and information technology procedures to maximise efficiencies, ensuring that the bulk of the time and human and financial resources available could be expended on programmes for children. During the year under review, UNICEF Azerbaijan allocated a total of US$ 2.9 million (approximately 5 million Manats) for its work in 2019 - of this, less than 20 per cent was spent on operating costs.
"
ECAR,Belarus,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Over 2019, the CO accelerated its channels for engagement into programming and overall awareness raising about child rights.
Importance of Parents and Communities as Critical Partners in Outreach and Service Design:  Across the programmes, experiences continued to underscore the importance for parents to not only be ‘subjects’ of services or outreach, but also active partners in design and implementation of responses.
Experiences in ECI service delivery revealed the need for effective partnerships among governmental institutions and NGOs and parents’ proactive participation in the decision-making processes, where UNICEF engaged a parental organization to mobilize and support parents of premature babies.  This parent organization has become another chain in the ECI referral mechanism.  To enhance effectiveness of the existing ECI system, legislative provisions on cross-sectoral collaboration is required to improve access, outreach and scale-up of ECI services to all eligible children under three years old.
At the same time, research also highlighted the critical role of parents and the subsequent requirement to build their nurturing capacities.  For example, the 2019 ECD KAP study highlighted adult-child interactions and parent support for ECE, where parents had more limited engagement in learning activities such as reading or looking at picture books, and musical activities such as playing music, singing or dancing.  Despite limited involvement, nearly all parents reported that ECE experiences are “important for their child's development and learning,” which points to the need for building awareness and capacity among parents.  Likewise, the CO’s 2019 research findings showed that parents (particularly fathers) play a critical role in adolescents’ mental health and well-being, with parents being strong factors for adolescents’ depressive and suicidal behaviours.
These lessons underscore the role that parents can have for other parents to raise understanding and positive practices.  The CO is taking this lesson learned within its designing of the 2021-2025 programme cycle with the incorporation of a programme that will strengthen efforts to build parents’ and caregivers’ capacities for nurturing and protective care through partnerships with government and CSO channels as well as parents themselves – mothers, fathers and other caregivers – to enhance their knowledge on good parenting practices.
Leveraging Allies in Private Sector: Over the last few years, the CO has taken significant efforts to build on-going relationships with partners in the private sector which has opened up the child rights dialogue to community spaces not reached earlier.  Partnering with businesses is only about leveraging financial resources, but also building outreach and awareness.  Examples have been the national campaign with Prior Bank in more than 40 bank branches across the country on, “Family for Every Child,” and the cyber safety exhibition jointly conducted with MTS.  Through the cyber safety exhibition, the CO with MTS was also able to gain more than 7,000 children’s practical experiences on the internet to inform better further programme responses.
At the same time, the CO has partnered with community influencers such as goodwill ambassadors, UNICEF friends and celebrities on critical child rights interventions such as the social inclusion campaign, “Just Kids.”  These colleagues and others accelerate UNICEF messages to broader population groups and raise attention in new contexts.  The CO has also initiated an advisory board comprising business people and other high-level community figures to serve as a sounding board who can provide critical insights.  Involvement of these partners have brought new perspectives to the CO’s interventions and created innovative approaches that have raised overall public engagement in child-related issues.
With Belarus’ hosting of the 2nd EuroGames, the CO built on the momentum to expand its work in sports partnerships.  Continuing to build its partnership with existing clubs such as Dinamo Minsk Hockey and the Association of Belarusian Football Federation, the office also entered new collaborations with the Bate Borisov Football Club as well as started negotiations with National Olympic Committee.  The popularity of sport in Belarus is immense and leveraging the power of brands has proven to be beneficial for promoting key messages around children’s rights.  In this capacity, the CO is partnering with sports organizations to also enhance outreach and reduce the threshold for accessibility of services, integrating sports for development in areas such as restorative justice.
Advancing Public Events to Bring UNICEF Closer:  To raise visibility and outreach to the broader community, the CO has participated in large events such as the Minsk half-marathon, the EuroGame fan zones and the CO’s annual Gala dinner.  These events connect UNICEF messages and issues to people of different ‘walks of life’.  Furthermore, they set the issues in a manner where people have fun yet learn about critical child rights issues.  In this capacity, people are more motivated to learn and to become involved.
The CO built on its existing volunteer group through the EuroGames.  Having initially a group of approximately 30 volunteers of adolescent and youth, through the CO’s collaboration with the MEGOC (the organizing agency) the number of volunteers grew to over 150 for the Games with participation in regions across Belarus.  On this momentum, the CO continued to reach out to volunteers and has established over 200 ‘regular’ volunteers (from 16-24 years) and more than 500 signed up for volunteering.  At the same time, the volunteers are participating at different levels – being located across the country and not just in the capital.  Volunteers participate in different events and have started to also become more involved in programme implementation.  In 2020, the CO is taking steps to further systematize it volunteering process and involve in more regular programme processes.
"
ECAR,Bosnia and Herzegovina,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In 2019, the delay in formation of the State and Federal Governments after the 2018 general elections significantly affected progress in most legislative and policy initiatives and the implementation of programmatic interventions by the Country Office. Overall programme implementation often remains complicated due to the multi-layer government with responsibilities at many different levels.
Lessons learned and innovations
1. Working with communities, influencers and young people:
During 2019 UNICEF BiH reached out directly to young people, parents and communities in a variety of different ways, such as through social media, U-Report polls, the IT Girls initiative and by organizing local level dialogues and debates with young and not-so-young people from diverse backgrounds. This kind of direct outreach brought very positive results in terms of engagement. One good example is the engagement of social media ‘influencers’ to promote the 30th anniversary of the CRC. This rather innovative approach proved to be successful in reaching a significant audience and engaging the social media influencers’ followers. As part of the Joint UN Programme ‘Dialogue for the Future’ popular musicians from BiH and Serbia produced the engaging song and video ‘Choose your words’, addressing hate speech. The catchy music video went viral with 101,000 views since its launch in November 2019, and over 4,000 comments without a single hate comment. To promote U-Report among the target population of adolescents, UNICEF BiH engaged with popular Youtubers at the ‘Balkan Tube Fest’, and consequently attracted around 1,000 new U-Reporters aged 12-18 from Bosnia and Herzegovina. UNICEF’s partnership and capacity development of media professionals during the year included the two most popular young YouTubers, engaging over 400,000 of their followers and opening a new communication channel with children and adolescents. The first ‘live’ session with these YouTubers generated over 100 written questions and comments in only 20 minutes of airtime. This practice will be further explored and extended in the coming years.
2. Innovative approach to improve vaccine coverage: 
Some of the other innovations include the country-wide roll-out of an ‘Immunization App’ in collaboration with Ministries of Health and Public Health Institutes. This provides parents/caregivers with information on when the next vaccine for their child is due and the closest health centre to make an appointment. This was complemented by support the development and operating of a blog, through a local NGO, to provide parents/caregivers with essential facts on vaccines in user-friendly local language.
3. Multi-sectoral approach:
UNICEF continued to leverage its comparative advantage by convening and supporting multi-sectoral programmes and partners. Examples include: the advocacy for early childhood development and for social inclusion of children with disabilities; the promotion of the ICF methodology; strengthening multi-sectoral coordination and mainstreaming child-specific vulnerabilities in local analysis, action planning and implementation under the Joint UN-Swiss Disaster Risk Reduction Programme; a multi-sectoral response to the refugee/migrant crisis; and  technical advice for policy development and systems strengthening across the spectrum of child rights, at both state, entity, cantonal and municipal levels. Government counterparts as well as multilateral institutions such as the EU, and bilateral donors recognised the expertise and capacity of UNICEF BiH in advancing the realisation of child rights. As one of the main lessons learned over the past years the cross-sectoral and multi-sectoral approach will remain an essential strategy of choice in the new CPD for 2021-2025.
4. Applying lessons from studies and evaluations to programming:
This includes the findings of the first PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) test for BiH and the recommendations from the evaluation of the 2016-2019 EU-supported programme ‘Transformation of Care Institutions and Prevention of Family Separation’. The latter confirmed that prevention is a priority for childcare reform and must be appropriately balanced against the provision of alternative care. UNICEF will advocate with government partners across the country for specific goals for childcare reform based on the evaluation recommendations. The recent media attention to violations of rights of certain children with disabilities in institutions generated a new momentum to further advocate for the deinstitutionalisation of all children. Additionally, there is a need to advocate for the overall child care system to be more inclusive of unaccompanied children on the move, considering the inadequate reception capacities and the absence of alternative care for them (foster care, small group homes).
5. Coordination challenges for refugee/migrant response:
Most of the humanitarian response, as in 2018, was provided by international actors, including the UN and NGOs. This pertains to accommodation in temporary reception centres, food, health care, protection and temporary education. UNICEF has been advocating consistently for the protection of children on the move including the many unaccompanied children. Although the crisis has gained some international media attention, it has still been very difficult to mobilise funds for the humanitarian response: UNICEF BiH managed to raise only 45 per cent of the projected needs for 2019. There is an urgent need to leverage commitment and resources for the humanitarian child protection response, considering the overwhelmed child protection system and the increasing cases of (gender-based) violence, abuse and exploitation, and for improved coordination among all protection actors, both in terms of advocacy as well as service delivery on the ground.
6. Limited availability of recent data to inform evidence-based decision-making:
A continuing challenge with regard to data in BiH remains the scattered availability of statistics and a lack of up-to-date comprehensive country-wide surveys and data collection systems in a number of sectors. For example, in 2019 there was still no agreement reached with government partners on moving ahead with the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS). This has affected evidence-based decision-making in several ways, although some of the challenges were mitigated by maintaining solid partnerships with the statistical institutes and supporting different types of assessments such as PISA, which generated a wealth of new information. 
 
Strategic prioritization and forward planning  
During 2019 the Country Office developed an updated Situation Analysis of Children in Bosnia and Herzegovina based on the latest evidence available and in consultation with key stakeholders. Based on this a strategic prioritization was conducted, as part of which a number of Programme Strategy Notes were developed to inform the content of the new Country Programme for 2021-2025. Regional Office advice was taken into consideration and gender considerations were duly taken into account in the programme design. The new UNICEF Country Programme is also informed by the UN Common Country Assessment and derived from the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework for 2021-2025. The Country Programme Document will be finalized in 2020, incorporating key lessons learned and setting out the main programmatic priorities, including a range of cross-sectoral interventions.

ECAR,Bulgaria,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The country office continued to use the well-established strategies of testing/modelling innovative services, continuous monitoring and learning to gather the evidence and influence thepolicy development and legislative reform. However, excelling in the program did not lead to scaling up results for children. This approach (model -test – innovate – evaluate- scale up) was challenged, mainly due to reliance on the project-based approach and negative narrative on innovations. The office will change the strategy in 2020 and consolidate the results from modelling and invest stronger efforts in elevating models of engagement. More proactive advocacy, higher level of technical assistance and better negotiated financial tools for targeted modelling will be used.
A “new normal” - growing and well-organized anti child rights /human rights movement in the country significantly influenced the decisions of the government to put on hold the two major strategic legal documents – National Strategy for the child 2019-2030 and Act on Social Services. The both documents were supported by UNICEF and civil society and their adoption would allow for better protection of vulnerable families and children as well as the greater investment in diversification of quality services for children.
As a response to the changing environment, UNICEF focused on skills and tools and preparedness for the new dynamics and trends. In that regard, a partnership with the local agency was established for developing a crisis communication response.
Training for UNICEF staff , UN agencies and NGOs partners was organized and common agreement reached – to change the strategy , from being reactive to development of  a preventative approach , i.e more present and positive messaging on child well being and good practice of the realization of children’s rights .
A joint communication and strong alliance of all the partners is necessary to mitigate the negative impact of fake news and anti -rights movements. This will be further supported by investing more in winning support for the cause of children from the wider public and decision makers.
Also, the new trends and dynamics in the country will require the expansion and innovation of partnerships and greater use of European, regional and national influencers. UNICEF will explore these opportunities in 2020, including using the power of religious leaders. UNICEF met representatives of the three main religious leaders in 2019 and agreed to invest in awareness raising session on children`s rights for religious scholars in 2020.
Additionally, the main approach towards innovation of social services for children is still project based, including the use of EU structural funds which leads to a very limited and short-term impact on children. The government needs to be better supported in planning and designing the budgetary process and ensuring that the vulnerable municipalities, families, youth and children are benefitted from the constant services guaranteed through the secured budget.
 
UNICEF laid the ground in 2019 for leveraging the power of business and markets for children. The extensive series of meetings with the Presidents and leaders of the main Chambers of Commerce took place where UNICEF positioned itself and strengthened the links between the child rights, business and development /achievement of sustainable developmental goals. This will lead to the creation of Advisory Board of Business for children in 2020. UNICEF will use this newly created space to present the program products and call for co-creation with the business.
 
The Country Office launched a CRC@30 national campaign “With Eyes Open for All”, dedicated to children with disabilities where adolescents and young people were empowered to be role-models and change agents in shifting public attitudes. The campaign culminated with a national summit on 20 November 2019 and placed adolescents and young people with disabilities at the center and amplified their voice. Following the Summit, the Country Office received a very strong and positive feedback about the uplifting impact of the event. The event was attended by all partners and diplomatic community in the country. This contribution of the office in building important and positive moments in the country is well noted and will be further strengthened in 2020. The office will invest more efforts in bringing together different   profile of citizens to discuss and raise awareness on the main issues for children in the country and offer a facilitated dialogue to present solutions and show case positive practice.
 The office will use the 2019 tested approach for stronger communication - integration of public communication and advocacy, mixing different communication channels (traditional media, digital, outdoor, UNICEF’s channels), with a mix of Communication for development (C4D) channels/approaches and Communication for partnerships approaches. This will be as the  key strategy to achieve and communicate results for children.

ECAR,Croatia,Lessons Learned and Innovations," 
In partnership with the Ministry of Justice and the NGO Roda, new models of support for children of imprisonedparents were promoted. In Croatia, 12,500 children are growing up without one or both parents who are imprisoned. These children face a unique set of challenges, discrimination, stigma, social exclusion and increased poverty. With UNICEF’s support, the Ministry of Justice introduced video visitation and strengthened the capacities of prison officials to support and help child-parent relationships in such circumstances. Prison officials were trained on communication skills, importance of family links and child-friendly procedures that meet both security requirements and children’s needs. Within the programme, IT equipment for video visitation was installed in 13 correctional facilities, while in 7 correctional facilities visits rooms for family/children’s visits were redecorated, furnished and equipped to create more child-friendly environments for children visiting their parents. All 23 correctional facilities received posters to inform children and adolescents about the daily life of their parents in prison and alleviate the fears and concerns of children. In total, 800 children benefited from these interventions in 2019. Video visitation is not a substitute for in-person contact, but it can support the continuous bond between the child and imprisoned parent. This innovation has already brought significant positive changes and, based on this, the Ministry of Justice has drafted a new law on prison sentences that incorporates video visits.
Investments in raising awareness and knowledge of corporate social responsibility and children’s rights are changing the way in which the business community sees children and their rights in Croatia. This will be further enhanced through the work of the Advisory Board for Children's Rights and Corporate Social Responsibility. Strategic role of this board is to influence other businesses and be a platform for dialogue with government and other partners on key issues. It is composed of the main national CSR and business networks and platforms and Croatian companies which have committed themselves to the Action Plan based on the recommendations of the first national survey on the impact of the business sector on children's rights carried out in 2019.
Significant potential has been identified in the implementation of the first Corporate Pathways to Pledge initiative with a bank. UNICEF in Croatia will continue to explore this efficient option for the future engagement of regular individual donors, as it also helps diversify outreach methods.
The strategic and integrated approach to the planning of key CO campaigns and initiatives, through the alignment of advocacy, fundraising and programme priorities and the optimisation of resources, has enabled multiple synergies in the engagement of key stakeholders, individual donors, corporate partners, digital influencers, offline supporters and the media. The immediate effects of an enhanced media presence, amplified messaging, stakeholder commitments, donations, as well as the offline and online engagement of key audiences, prove the efficiency of such an approach in achieving country programme outputs.
In 2019, integrated campaigns led to enhanced cooperation with media companies, focused investments in multimedia content and relations with influencers, which resulted in the stronger amplification of UNICEF key advocacy and brand messages, as well as engagement with key audiences. UNICEF engaged with 34 per cent more people to take offline action for children than in 2018, with young people representing more than 60 per cent of the total.
Strategically planned and meaningful participation of children and adolescent boys and girls in key initiatives has brought new dynamics, perspectives and ideas to public events and campaigns organised by UNICEF and partners in 2019, thus opening new opportunities to engage with key decision makers, broaden private and public partners, as well as to utilise new channels to mobilise resources and advocate for the better lives of the most vulnerable children in Croatia. Thus, the CO will intensify its work with partners on the creation of innovative partnerships and platform for child and adolescents’ meaningful participation and contribution in the realization of child rights in Croatia and in development of their 21 century skills.
In cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs, the CO is working on the establishment of formal mechanisms – Junior Ambassadors to the EU Programme, a sustainable platform to help raise awareness of policymakers on issues of adolescent boys and girls and on the importance of youth participation in decision making processes that will particularly be important in the context of the Croatian Presidency of Council of the EU in 2020.

ECAR,Georgia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"3.1 Lessons Learned                                                                               
Code on the Rights of the Child
The adoption of the Code on the Rights of the Child was the result of an effective partnership between the Parliament Committee on Human Rights and Civil Integration and UNICEF, with political and financial support from the EU. While fully respecting the sovereignty of the Parliament in deciding on Georgian legislation, UNICEF, as guardian of international child rights standards, worked closely with the Parliament to ensure full compliance of the Code with international and European child rights standards. UNICEF also engaged with the EU as Georgia’s close partner to get political support. Through constructive and respectful engagement with all relevant stakeholders, the challenges to the draft Code from various actors were overcome.
Key aspects of this successful engagement were:

UNICEF maintained an influential gatekeeping role and was not compromised by any specific national narrative.
UNICEF advocated for and ensured a fully consultative process in the development of the Code with all relevant Government agencies, NGOs, religious communities, and Parliamentarians.
Consultations were held with children from east and west Georgia, which proved to be an important step towards adoption of the Code.
UNICEF’s continuous engagement with all stakeholders, including political support from the EU, facilitated discussions on controversial topics and agreement on articles to include in the Code.
Conservative groups believed the Code was undermining Georgian traditional family values. UNICEF engaged in an open dialogue with conservative groups and religious institutions to explain the meaning and benefits of the Code. This resulted in the full endorsement of the Code by the Patriarch of the GOC. Consultations were also held with the Muslim community, and a partnership established with the State Agency for Religious Issues, under the Prime Minister’s Office.
UNICEF supported the Parliament in launching a communication campaign on the Code and developing key messages for the public.
3.2 Innovations
Engagement with religious leaders
Opposition faced from some Parliamentarians, political conservative groups and the Georgian Orthodox Church (GOC) during development of the Code on the Rights of the Child, highlighted the need for UNICEF to engage in an open and mutually respectful dialogue with all parties, including the GOC and other religious communities to raise awareness on child rights, including access to health services such as immunizations, and respond to widespread stereotypes and misunderstandings about alleged contradictions between child rights, the rights of parents, and traditional family values. In response to these challenges, UNICEF undertook efforts to build a new innovative value-based partnership with religious leaders and communities and remained open and transparent in engagements with all concerned parties.
However, as the GoC is the most trusted institution in Georgia, these new efforts of UNICEF go beyond awareness raising and diffusion of stereotypes and misunderstandings, as they aim at mobilizing the enormous potential of religious leaders to become actors of social change promoting child rights practices in their communities. Several workshops with priests, imams and representatives of Churches were organized covering all topics of interest related to the situation of children in Georgia, international child rights documents and standards, the benefits from the adoption of the Code on the Rights of the Child, as well as UNICEF’s work in Georgia and its position on major issues faced by children in Georgia. This new engagement eventually ensured the open support of the GOC for the adoption of the Code on the Rights of the Child. In August 2019, UNICEF signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the State Agency on Religious Issues, which will allow expansion of the emerging partnership to all religious denominations in the country and the development of specific joint guidance documents on child rights.
The process and lessons learnt are being documented and a short video will high-light key steps in the process.
Study of Lead Exposure Sources
Following up on the MICS results on blood lead levels in children, a study of sources and pathways of lead exposure was designed during 2019. Based on cross-sectoral analyses of lead and other MICS indicators, GIS mapping, as well as stable isotopic ratio analyses of lead particles found in venous blood samples of lead exposed children, hypotheses on potential sources of lead contamination will be formed. Homes, kindergartens, playgrounds and other areas where children with high lead levels spend time will be investigated for lead contamination. Investigation of testing sites will start by screening walls, toys and other objects using XRF analyzers. Specimen of food, water, etc. will be collected and analyzed using atomic absorption spectrometers (AAS). Once results of XRF and AAS testing are available, they will be entered in an Integrated Exposure Uptake Biokinetic (IEUBK) software to compare modeled lead prevalence among children with lead prevalence found during MICS. 
To establish a control group, children with high lead levels will be matched in a quasi-experimental manner to children with lead levels under 5mcg/dL. The same lead contamination investigation procedure and technique will be used in households, kindergartens and other sites where control group children spent their time.
New approach to staff learning and development (L&D)
In 2019, UNICEF introduced a new approach to staff learning and development (L&D). Along with traditional individual and group trainings, two innovative models for L&D were introduced: cooperative learning sessions (CLS) and partnerships with universities (PwU). CLS are facilitated by UNICEF staff members/consultants within their field of expertise. They effectively contribute to learning and development of staff, but also help to deepen cross-sectoral work. PwU envisions mutual knowledge sharing between UNICEF and universities aimed at promotion of child rights in universities and at supporting L&D of UNICEF staff for more efficient delivery of results for children. UNICEF’s L&D Plan for 2020 was developed by the L&D Committee in a highly participatory way based on a survey on L&D needs and subsequent discussions with all staff members and long-term consultants.

ECAR,Kazakhstan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Social work
To sustain the multi-sectoral social workforce quality assurance operational procedures, cross ministerial policy work is required. For better support to children with special educational needs the “whole school” approach should be employed, covering inclusive ethos and inclusive education teaching and learning. In identification of children at risk of dropping out of education, the improvement of data tracking and recording mechanisms is needed with the focus on accuracy of dropout predictions by combination of multiple risk factors.  The capacity building strategy should focus on development of knowledge and skills of professionals at school and regional levels about the early warning mechanism and monitoring of children at risk to sustain the continuity of practices. UNICEF will support the documentation of the “whole school” approach and guide data tracking and recording mechanisms. In coordination with government partners, the tested early warning mechanism and monitoring of children at risk will be prepared for scale up, including through development of in-service training manuals.
Violence against children
Recent changes in the legislation related to mandatory reporting  of violations of child rights and sanctions for non-reporting are positive, but both the system and the frontline health, education, and social protection workers are not fully ready to accommodate the new regulations. The roll-out of such legislation needs careful planning. If not supported by a dedicated and trained social service workforce for managing child abuse and neglect cases hasty roll-out can lead to unnecessary separation of children from their families. 
Migrant children
A new study on the child rights protection system for children affected by migration in Kazakhstan yields some interesting lessons. Among Kazakhstani children reasons for becoming unaccompanied or separated include intra-family violence, neglect or abandonment, parental addiction. Among non-national children: independent job seeking and work in family enterprises. National children have greater chances to be identified by the child protection system compared to non-national children.
Partnership with business
In 2019, UNICEF identified new ways to partner with business in Kazakhstan. For example, a new partnership with the national post service Kazpost focuses on promoting positive parenting practices among staff and customers.  To promote inclusion and the rights of children with disabilities, UNICEF and ‘Samryk Kazyna Trust’ launched a joint campaign #ItsAllAboutAblity.  The campaign envisages that businesses will contribute to creation of enabling environment for inclusion in their communities and provide equal opportunities for persons and children with disability. The campaign was supported also by MEGA Silk Way shopping center, MYD production, Kazpost, Astana Football team and Akimat of Saryarka district of Nur-Sultan city.
To advance our partnership with the private sector, more evidence is needed. Thus, Kazakhstan CO has started a landscape analysis of business and its potential impact on child rights realisation to enable more strategic engagement. Also, additional investments are required in operationalising shared-value partnerships with the private sector.
Innovations
In close collaboration with the Innovation Fund, DFAM and ICTD, Kazakhstan CO jointly with ITU through the Innovations Lab has developed a smart contract, based on blockchain technology, applied to Direct Cash Transfers according to the HACT procedure. The solution facilitates increased transparency and accountability in transferring resources and goods to UNICEF partners.
The UNICEF Kazakhstan Innovations Lab continued hosting various educational events, including workshops, lectures, a Data Science Challenge and an 8-week summer residency to develop skills of over 125 young people (under 25 y.o.)  in the areas of Big Data, project management, critical thinking, while strengthening their knowledge on SDGs and child rights. Three projects, developed by young people with the support of the UNICEF Kazakhstan Innovations Lab mentors, have been presented at the Digital Health 2.0 Forum organized by the Ministry of Health. For example, the Sequence application, developed by two young girls, helps to monitor a person’s daily intake of medications and has been ranked among the top-20 ideas by the global Google Science Fair. Also, a case management prototype has been developed to create a unified interlinked database of social services for families with children. 
In 2019, UNICEF continued to support the established drone corridors in Kazakhstan. In partnership with the Central Asian Center on Emergencies and Disaster Risk Reduction (CESDRR), several rounds of UAV testing flights were conducted with participation of experts from government agencies (for emergency situations, forest and environment protection, avalanche and landslide prevention), province and local level administrations. Use of drones in search and rescue of a child, wildfire identification and response and flooding risk assessment was tested in the southern and northern drone corridors. Local emergency specialists gained knowledge and experience on how UAVs can help them during disaster risk reduction and emergency response. An international round table event on the drone testing experience and knowledge sharing was held in Nur-Sultan in May 2019, with participation of disaster risk reduction experts from Central Asia, Russian Federation and from several international organizations. Through the activities of the UNICEF CO the authorities in Kazakhstan and the CESDRR, have started to explore the use of and strengthened their capacities on UAVs. As a result, the Government of Kazakhstan established a dedicated drones unit under the Committee for Emergency Situations. UNICEF will continue providing technical expertise to the responsible staff in the Emergency Committee. Drone testing corridors will be used by the CESDRR to test the drone technology before engaging in specific contracts with the government and new use-cases.
In 2019 nine new partnerships have been established, involving Government, academia, and local business to inform, help and co-design solutions with an impact on children. In partnership with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, UNICEF Kazakhstan Innovations Lab continued to work on strengthening innovative skills of young people by hosting various educational events, including workshops, lectures, Data Science Challenge and 8-week summer residency. As a result, 125 young people (under 25 y.o.) from different regions of Kazakhstan developed skills and knowledge in the area of Big Data, project management, critical thinking, and strengthened their knowledge on SDGs and child rights. 
A new partnership was established with the Kazakh National University Technopark to cooperate in the area of STEM, with specific focus on girls. Under the new programme, supported by UNICEF Innovations Fund, an educational course on building nanosatellites will be developed, and a group of girls and young women will participate in the training and will build a nanosatellite prototype. 
"
ECAR,Kosovo (UN SC resolution 1244),Lessons Learned and Innovations,"During 2019, UNICEF’s overall strategic approach in Kosovo shifted, based on lessons learned and opportunities to address the bottlenecks and barriers hindering realization of rights for all children. The interventions were designed and informed by these four broad strategic thrusts: (1) Influencing national policies and advocating for more public investments in children; (2) Demonstration of promising interventions at the municipality level; (3) Partnerships for scaling up promising solutions and; and (4) Knowledge management, innovation, monitoring and evaluation. These strategies were developed and implemented within the framework of the UN reform process. This provided a clear framework for the implementation of converging interventions and activities in a multisectoral approach, at both central and local levels.
While national legislation and policies are largely in line with international standards, they are not necessarily translated into concrete actions, hindering the realization of the rights of children and adolescents. It is therefore critical for UNICEF to continue to strengthen national systems and advocate for increased public investments for children at the national level which are based on evidence and address the needs of the most vulnerable. 
To maximize results for children and adolescents and to reach the most vulnerable groups, UNICEF Kosovo increased its focus on demonstration of promising solutions at the municipality level. Five municipalities were selected where UNICEF - in partnership with mayors and other relevant stakeholders - initiated the modelling of quality programming approaches based on the leave no one behind principle, resulting in the establishment of four Innovation Hubs. The Hubs will serve as the gateway for engaging with adolescents and young people in these municipalities and further strengthen the convergence interventions. For example, an UPSHIFT programme was conducted in one of these locations, with juveniles in conflict with the law at the Educational Correctional Centre. Additionally, the collaboration of UNICEF Kosovo with the CSR Network on mentorship scheme will serve as a good entry point for venturing shared value partnership with the private sector.   
Another promising solution developed by UNICEF and partners addresses the misalignment between education outcomes and labour market needs which results in a high degree of unemployment among university and vocational education graduates is the Kosovo Volunteers App[1] Empowering both young people and employers to bridge the gap between education and employment, Kosovo Volunteers, which translates volunteer work into actual work experience,  has been fully embraced by the government and continues to grow in popularity among the population.
Increased investment in and focus on strengthening evidence generation is necessary to ensure adequate monitoring of child rights issues in Kosovo and inform the scaling up of promising local level solutions. For example, UNICEF Kosovo supported KAS for the implementation of MICS, which will inform SDG baselines and the subsequent decade of action, including the development and monitoring of national strategies. Additionally, the successful completion of UPHV evaluation will influence the design and implementation of the home visiting programme to ensure greater reach of children 0-3 years and pregnant women. Additionally, the introduction of “e-Tools” significantly contributed to strengthening internal knowledge management systems through a real time entry and monitoring of inputs from field visits. It is therefore essential to further strengthen the focus on knowledge management, innovation, monitoring and evaluation in support of evidence, research, studies and evaluations, while working closely with academia to ensure quality and with media for wider dissemination of findings.
Building on the critical importance of cross-sectoral interventions for maximizing results for children and adolescents, the Sit-An developed in 2019 followed a life cycle approach methodology with the “whole” child at the centre of analysis. This contributed to identification of key bottlenecks and opportunities that require multisectoral approach interventions and were translated into three key priority areas for the new Kosovo Programme for 2021-2025: ECD; inclusion of children with disabilities; and empowerment of youth. In addition, engagement of all relevant stakeholders, particularly young people, on the development of the Sit-An and the Kosovo Programme for 2021-2025 boosted ownership by Kosovo institutions and other partners on identified priorities for the upcoming programme. It strengthened the relevance of the process and ensured that broader perspectives were clearly analysed and incorporated and the voices of stakeholders - especially children and young people - were more accurately reflected.
In the context of UN reform, UNICEF played a key role in terms of its strategic positioning and strengthening its collaboration with the Development Coordinator aka Resident Coordinator and all other UN Agencies. The close engagement on the preparation of the evaluation of the current UNCDP, the development of the Common Kosovo Analysis and the internal prioritization exercise for the new UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework through the thematic groups led by UNICEF, namely Adolescents, Social Inclusion and M&E/SDG groups, ensured that the child rights agenda was fully mainstreamed. This also contributed to intensifying the partnership between UN agencies on joint projects such as Empowering Youth for a Peaceful, Prosperous and Sustainable Future with UNV, UNICEF, UN Women financed by the UN Secretary-General’s Peace Building Fund; MICS implementation with UN Women, UNDCO, UNFPA; and the Generation Unlimited workshop organized in collaboration with UNDP. UNICEF in collaboration with UNMIK co-organized the third UN Youth Assembly that became the biggest annual multi-ethnic platform for young people from different communities in Kosovo.

ECAR,Moldova,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The Key Role of Middle Management in Government Partnerships  
In a context of high political instability following parliamentarian elections and local elections in the year 2019, the country experienced three different governments in less than one year. Though this was a considerable challenge for the country office’s programme implementation context with its strong focus on accelerating delivering tangible results for children, many of the planned activities could still progress as set out in the Joint Rolling Work plans for 2018-2019.
For instance, in Education, UNICEF Moldova was able to continue its support for further advancing the implementation of the education reform, including the finalization of the comprehensive Education Sector Analysis funded by the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) and the application for additional funding by GPE for the development of the new Education Sector Development Plan. While some delays in implementation were inevitable, the key role played by the middle management in the Ministry of Education, Culture and Research (MECR) and its institutional knowledge were determinant in overcoming the impediments faced due to the political context faced. As a conclusion, more focused and intensified interaction with the government’s middle management in time of high political turmoil can substantially mitigate the adverse impact on country office programme implementation, especially when it concerns activities which are less politically sensitive and can generate a form of consensus.    
Preventing Brand Erosion  
The country’s middle-income status constrains the availability of Overseas Development Assistance for the Country Programme and thereby to a certain extent also ongoing efforts to make UNICEF’s brand more visible among development and multilateral partners. Moreover, both the increased competition for available resources and focus of donors on their own brand’s visibility, pose additional challenges. Moreover, the conditionalities of an increased number of donors to predominantly work under a One UN brand within a shared pool of resources, may also further blur the lines between the mandates and expertise among the various UN agencies.  
While the ‘Communicating as One’ Global Guidelines, have been to some extent helpful in this respect, such context may call for a further rethinking of UNICEF’s brand strategy, role and engagement with local partners in a middle-income country context. This could entail the identification of innovative ways of communication with development partners, governments, other UN agencies and the general public under a much-required unified UN system, while at the same time preventing brand erosion and the loss of the unique identity that sets UNICEF apart from other UN agencies.    
On a different but related note, nurturing and loyalising new and existing Implementing Partners can also be challenging, as well as keeping ownership over the jointly developed products and overseeing both their use and distribution. While trying to access adequate funding and also supporting the implementation of the joint Government of Moldova and UNICEF Country Programme, our various implementing partners are often also interested in building and further strengthening their own brand. Accordingly, they may further recycle and build upon the platforms and products, earlier jointly developed with UNICEF, which can create confusion for the general public, and entail further brand erosion for UNICEF. The extent to which such use and distribution could be considered a fair use is sometimes complicated to assess, especially given a relatively weak related legal framework within the country in case attempts made to apply such concepts in negotiations with partners did not work. Therefore, there is a need for further enhanced guidelines on copyright over the products created within a partnership agreement between UNICEF and Civil Society Organization partners.   
The Value of Edutainment  
Edutainment, a portmanteau of the words “education” and “entertainment” refers to tools and techniques that combine education with entertainment. During this reporting period UNICEF Moldova increasingly worked with its partners on various edutainment activities, including several innovative initiatives involving music, theatre and photography, which proved to be very efficient communication tools. As part of a partnership with the MECR, National Theatre “Mihai Eminescu” and Art Centre “Coliseum”, children and adolescents learned about online safety. The general public was sensitized about the rights of children in conflict with the law through a photography project involving boys in Goian penitentiary.
Furthermore, during the year 2019, UNICEF Moldova in close partnership with the Parliament of Moldova effectively used an innovative tool – an interactive games platform – to raise awareness about the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the Sustainable Development Goals, while simultaneously engaging children and young people in related inspiring dialogue with members of the Moldovan Parliament, opinion leaders, media personalities, business people, and other influencers.  
 
"
ECAR,North Macedonia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF has contributed to the realisation of powerful results for children in North Macedonia in 2019.  Landmark successes have been seen in social protection, in education reform, in early childhood development and in the movement of public opinion toward building positive and violence free families and communities.  This has only been possible, however, because of a wider momentum for change, with  reform-minded Government and highest-level commitments for action.  The lesson for UNICEF in this is the need to be deeply aware of its context, and agile, ready to act and build on wider opportunities for change.  With decisive and timely action, UNICEF’s work can catalyse a wider breadth of consensus. 
 
Though 2019, UNICEF has leveraged evidence for action to overcome potential barriers to this on-going change.  In the Education sector, UNICEF was able to use the UNICEF-OECD 2018 analysis Review of Evaluation and Assessment in Educationwhich ostensibly centred only on educational assessment to bring wider dialogue and reform of the education system as a whole.  When faced with potential derailing of the new Social Protection reforms providing cash benefits to all children in need, UNICEF worked with the World Bank to leverage convincing evidence to bring opponents on board, paving the way for approval of the new law.  In the process of de-institutionalisation, a commitment of the current administration, UNICEF was similarly able to act immediately in support of the Government, embedding technical assistance within the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy to support rapid planning and change, and building depth of action across community services to make the rapid reforms potentially more sustainable.  These instances are examples where UNICEF, tuned to the immediate context and potential, can leverage its particular comparative advantage and credibility to build on child rights momentum for wider change.
 
Despite this success, the dramatic progress seen in 2019 will only be truly positive if it is continued. UNICEF now faces the need to build long term capacity, institutional reform and sustainability to ensure that momentum, collaboration and commitment to change for children continues. 
 
This will require on-going political will, and long-term systems change – development of mechanisms and capacities that will continue to grow and allow reforms to be embedded.  It will also require social change – real and renewed commitment for action.  Public opinion is fragile.  Despite many voices in favour of change, there have been examples of resistance to child centred reforms through 2019 – public complaints when de-institutionalised children have been re-housed in communities, and on-going opposition to vaccination and to inclusive classroom. 
 
These risks are heightened in the climate of on-going political change in the country.  The failure to gain an EU accession date as expected in October has strengthened voices of criticism to the reforms earlier in the year, and the early elections called after that disappointment mean the very real danger that reforms may be overhauled in 2020.  UNICEF must work with partners in a strategic manner at this fragile and crucial juncture to ensure that progress for children is not reversed, but rather strengthened well into the future. 
"
ECAR,Rep of Uzbekistan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons Learnt
During the current country programme UNICEF has been actively engaged with government in creating an enabling environment for fulfilling and promoting rights of children. A considerable number of laws, policies and programmes have been revised or developed with UNICEF support. UNICEF experience in the country has shown that without pairing such efforts with well-planned capacity development exercises during and after reforms, change might not come easily. The improved policy and programme environments require competent staff to sustain them throughout the reform process. The capacity development interventions can vary from direct training of staff, to facilitating exposure to international best practices or handholding during the reform process. Introduction of management information systems, curriculum reform, and introduction of a national assessment system in education are examples where combined implementation strategies have been crucial for success.
In major change processes where bottlenecks and barriers present themselves not only as gaps in enabling environment and capacity of duty bearers, but also in social norms, a comprehensive impact strategy and advocacy plan needs to be developed to support the change process. For example, despite the President’s call to renew approaches towards young people, and UNICEF’s ongoing advocacy and initiatives on youth engagement, policy development and implementation remains centralized and top-down.
UNICEF has been successful in inclusion of child protection agenda in the policy of the Government at national level. However, while a systemic approach is important, the development and provision of services at family level are mutually reinforcing. Throughout 2019, interaction between UNICEF and district authorities has not only confirmed that services at local level must be strengthened, but also that demand for services and awareness of families and children needs to be increased in parallel. This requires involving communities and civil society in increasing awareness of children’s rights, as well as changes to social norms that prevent the separation of children from a family environment.
One of the programmes supported by UNICEF, namely establishment of an effective coordination mechanism in social protection was challenged by political disagreement and differences of opinion on urgency and timing as well as its structure and main functions. Main lesson learnt has been that a very wide range of national partners and development actors should always be involved in the discussions and consultations.
Generating evidence and using findings of studies in advocating for policy and programme reforms has been instrumental beyond expectation. UNICEF completed a good number of studies in the reporting period, such as the National Learning Assessment Study or the National Nutrition Survey. The findings of the first study were very much expected by UNICEF and therefore did not fundamentally affect its programme, however, they had considerable impact in increasing ownership of the Programme by Government and trust in UNICEF cooperation. In health sector, nutrition programme gained higher level of prominence in Government programmes and stronger ownership once results of the national survey were disseminated.
In fast-paced reform contexts like that of Uzbekistan, remaining responsive to diverse and increasing demands by partners, and at the same time staying focused on results is a major challenge. At initial stages of such reforms, agility and responsiveness play an important role, however, once trust is built, it is time to decide more selectively on areas of strategic interventions. This shift requires a good understanding of the development context and the political economy combined with calculated risk taking.
 
Innovations
Introduction of the Single Registry is an example of innovation in integration of social protection system and more effective delivery of social protection programmes. Integrating the single registry with databases of such agencies as Tax Committee, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of Employment and Labour Relations allowed instant verifications of the applications. It enabled the Government to replace the current practice of paper-based and subjective community targeting with more transparent and efficient means of testing based on verifiable criteria. Eventually, bringing all social protection programmes into the Single Registry will enable it to become an effective case management tool for social workers and relevant ministries.
Representative and valid data in development programming is important, but not always available. Lack of information can pose challenges for the success of programmes. To design and implement campaigns on violence and gender equality, when there is limited data, UNICEF developed campaigns based on voices of young people. U-reporters were called upon to send their views and campaigns were rolled out based on their perceptions.
In the reporting period, UNICEF developed a conceptual framework for alternative and innovative preschool programmes. The one-year pre-primary schools are already modelled by MOPSE. The preschools using Public Private Partnership models were also designed with UNICEF’s technical inputs. For the first time in the country, the concept and tools for self-assessment of educational institutions were introduced alongside external assessment. Uzbekistan national educational assessment system has always been based on traditional non-standardized testing methodologies. With UNICEF support, new tools and methods in line with international best practices were introduced, making analysis based on multi-variate models possible.

ECAR,Republic of Kyrgyzstan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Innovation 
Through the Youth and Child-Friendly Local Governance (YCFLG) initiative (globally known as Child-Friendly Cities), and in close collaboration with municipal authorities, UNICEF has succeeded at bringing issues raised by children and young people into local planning processes, and this has resulted in concrete actions.  The initiative began in Kyrgyzstan with 700 children and young people in 10 pilot rural municipalities in 2016, and now covers 42 urban and rural municipalities, reaching 11,000 adolescents and young people (around 60 per cent girls).
The expansion was enabled by solid buy-in from central Government, strong leadership from local governments, constant advocacy efforts and understanding of how youth inclusion is beneficial for long-term social cohesion.
While the YCFLG pilot model provided children and youth with opportunities to bring their issues to the attention of local governments and for them to be addressed through budgeted plans, the UPSHIFT social innovation tool is building the capacity of children and young people to become direct actors in the changes they want to see in their towns. At intensive workshops, 2,340 young people (67 per cent female) learn how to creatively turn issues into solutions and prototype them with communities and decision-makers. The best solutions, which can be converted into concrete projects, receive funding from UNICEF, local governments and private institutions for implementation. In the process, young people acquire creativity, innovation, analytical thinking, resilience and adaptability skills.
In 2019, the Government used the YCFLG initiative to implement a contest in the 18 cities included in the Presidential Regional Development Concept. The award will go to the best Child- and Youth-Friendly City, based on the municipality’s performance against a set of indicators, including children and youth participation, protection from violence, and access to education and health. This contest reveals the clear recognition by the Government of the value of the YCFLG, but beyond this one-off competition, the Government and UNICEF need to discuss the YCFLG initiative’s sustainability. YCFLG requires not only commitments but also clear deliverables from municipalities to improve services for children and young people and emphasize their participation in planning and delivering these services.
UNICEF is directing advocacy efforts and technical support to drive the institutionalization of youth- and child-friendly planning and budgeting locally. The long-term strategic objective of the YCFLG is to ensure mandatory collection of age and sex-disaggregated data on children’s and young people’s needs and demands, and that they are addressed through local development.
In Kyrgyzstan, local self-governments receive a significant proportion of their budgets from the central level. Thus, it is important that funding for these local governments can be earmarked to support more action in favour of children at the local level. Analyzing budgetary allocations and roles and responsibilities at the central and local levels of governance could be useful in this regard. 
The transformative value of the process lies in supporting more participatory processes for decision making and offering adolescents and young people opportunities to be heard before they can express their opinions through the electoral system. In turn, participation and active citizenship among youth will help reduce the gap between politicians and civil society, thus leading to a more cohesive and peaceful state.
Lessons Learned
In 2019, Kyrgyzstan was selected as one of the case study countries for the Global Gender Action Plan (GAP) Evaluation. This review process has been useful for internal reflections on progress in both gender programming and institutionalization of gender mainstreaming during the first two years of the country programme. It was recognized that the Gender Programme Review in 2016 was a critical moment for UNICEF Kyrgyzstan to better consider the need to improve its gender programming, and this resulted in the establishment of the post of Gender Programme Officer in the new country programme (2018-2022).
Key observations from the GAP review are that the work in 2018 was dedicated to establishing internal systems for reviewing key programme documents, including terms of reference, work plans, partnership documents and communication products, to ensure that gender is integrated across all interventions. The Country Office Gender Strategy was developed and endorsed to contextualize the Global Gender Action Plan within the Country Programme Document (CPD) and identify key gender inequality issues and strategic entry points for programming. Accountabilities for advancing gender programming were included in the performance plans of Outcome Leads. The CPD also focused on ensuring cross-sectoral work to improve gender integration. These efforts resulted in greater sensitization of Country Office personnel and partners on the gender mainstreaming approach.
Building on these improved review systems and greater awareness and buy-in from staff, UNICEF Kyrgyzstan achieved important integrated results for gender in 2019, specifically in education. The Ministry of Education and Science institutionalized an internal mechanism to review all new draft teaching and learning materials for gender-neutral, gender-positive and anti-discrimination principles. The new Education Sector Strategy has also integrated gender equality considerations. UNICEF also supported the development of a new national plan to end child marriage as a follow up to the previous 2017-2018 plan. The document is expected to be endorsed in 2020, providing a framework for the health, education, social protection, youth, law enforcement and judicial sectors to address child marriage with a multi-sectoral response. Resource mobilization for gender-targeted initiatives has resulted in new funding for advancing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education for girls and addressing violence against women and girls. UNICEF is recognized as one of the key partners for advancing gender equality, among both development partners and national stakeholders.
Some gender initiatives currently remain at the discretion of motivated programme staff. To further enhance this focus on gender, systematic gender integration, monitoring and reporting on gender results will require revision of the country programme at the output level to better articulate integrated results within sectors, and specific results targeting adolescent girls. Gender results, indicators and clear targets will need to be formulated to adequately capture and report on the work being undertaken by the Country Office, accountabilities will need to be clarified, and resources will need to be secured that are dedicated for transformative gender results.
"
ECAR,Republic of Montenegro,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"During 2019 UNICEF Montenegro focused sharply on two cross-sectoral priorities, ECD and child poverty, and effectively employed cross-cutting change strategies to achieve results at scale for children. Key insights, lessons learned and conclusions include: 

Early childhood development. A key cross-sectoral priority in 2019 was advocacy for increased investment in ECD and integrated ECD policies and services. A high-level conference on ECD sought to influence Montenegro’s economic reform programme and promote cross-sectoral collaboration. UNICEF’s  arguments for investing in the early years, supported by renowned international speakers, resonated strongly with key stakeholders. Given the country’s constrained fiscal space and need to improve the effectiveness of public spending, UNICEF’s ECD arguments proved to be very effective. The conference resulted in a government commitment to develop Montenegro’s first national ECD strategy. During 2020 UNICEF will support strategy development and scaling-up of integrated services.
Child poverty. Poverty has emerged as a significant underlying cause for child rights violations in Montenegro, confirmed by recent data and the multi-dimensional child poverty analysis (MODA) initiated by UNICEF in 2019. Without addressing child poverty through cross-sectoral approaches, little can be done to sustainably improve child rights. Preliminary findings also revealed emerging issues linked to multidimensional poverty, such as: the impact of shame and stigma on poor children; poor children being often unable to access basic services; social welfare entrapping children in poverty, and substance abuse and mental health issues are critical concerns among adolescents. The full results will be published in 2020 and – together with the ongoing assessment – will inform future reform of the social protection system.         
Alignment with EU accession process. Aligning advocacy and programming to overriding national priorities, particularly EU accession, was a useful strategy. By highlighting the contribution of child rights to Montenegro’s progress on the EU accession agenda UNICEF achieved important gains (e.g., integrating children’s access to justice in the new justice reform strategy – a key EU benchmark). UNICEF’s contributions to the EU annual enlargement package also helped to draw attention to urgent challenges, including gender-based violence and violence against children. UNICEF and the EU jointly advocated on several key priorities, including: justice system reform, child and social protection reform, ECD, youth empowerment and CRC@30. UNICEF Montenegro expects to leverage and mobilize EU resources in 2020 and beyond.
Private sector partnerships. As a middle-income country, Montenegro has the potential to mobilize and leverage resources from private sector partnerships and promote child rights in business. Mapping of strategic opportunities for private sector engagement and resource mobilization undertaken in 2019 revealed interest by the national and sub-regional corporate sector in partnering with UNICEF. Engagement with business councils proved to be an effective way to reach individual businesses. However, private sector engagement demands full-time staff capacity; without additional resources opportunities for small country offices to meaningfully engage and generate resources are limited. This challenge needs to be addressed so that all country offices can tap into local funding and partnership opportunities.
Using evidence to drive change continued to be a key strategy for creating a solid foundation for evidence-based policy making and monitoring of child rights. Given Montenegro’s weak culture of data collection, analysis, use and monitoring, strengthening capacities at MONSTAT and within line ministries (for sectoral information systems) remained a key priority. An important lesson learned in 2019 was that evidence-generation activities should be combined with strengthening national capacities. UNICEF invested in strengthening data-related capacity within MONSTAT and line ministries, and will continue to do so in 2020. A related strategy was teaming international consultants with national experts to ensure sustainable knowledge transfer and capacity building – to support, rather than supplant, national capacity.  
Looking forward 
To scale up successful programme approaches and address key challenges and lessons learned highlighted in previous sections UNICEF will focus on several priorities in 2020:

Implementation. Following important progress toward bringing Montenegro’s legal and policy framework in line with international standards, now the focus should be on ensuring that laws, strategies and policies are implemented. UNICEF will continue to build the capacity of policy-makers and professionals to implement and monitor policies aimed at achieving equitable results for all children in Montenegro.
Cross-sectoral collaboration. To enable policy-makers and professionals to address complex challenges affecting the most vulnerable children, UNICEF will continue to promote cross-sectoral collaboration. Achieving a collaborative work culture and cross-sectoral results takes time. Political commitment will be key to clarifying responsibilities and accountabilities for cross-sectoral collaboration.
Public finance for children. Given shrinking aid from overseas, limited fiscal space and the need for improved effectiveness of public spending, UNICEF will strengthen its capacity in the area of public finance management. Linkages established in 2019 with the ministries of finance and public administration and the Government Secretariat will require strengthening in coming years. This investment should contribute to leveraging domestic resources and improving public sector planning, budgeting and monitoring practices.
Situation analysis. Building on the wealth of evidence generated over the last two years on the situation of children in Montenegro and underlying causes of exclusion, UNICEF will synthesize data, knowledge and analysis in a situation analysis to inform the 2022–2026 country programme and the UN sustainable development cooperation framework .
Private sector engagement. While there is clear potential for developing private sector partnerships in Montenegro, the culture of giving by private sector and individuals is not yet well developed and requires nurturing. To sustain shared-value private sector engagement in achieving results for children UNICEF will invest in dedicated staff capacity .
As we enter the Decade for Action on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, these efforts should equip UNICEF Montenegro to deliver results at scale –  ensuring that all children in Montenegro can realize their rights and leaving no child behind.

ECAR,Romania,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Romanian Children's Board and Junior Ambassadors to the EU
As part of the EU Presidency UNICEF established the Romanian Children’ Board comprised of 20 children (under 18) from all parts of Romania, from different socio-economic background and ethnic groups. Members were selected mostly from existing child led organizations and councils, such as the Romanian Students Council. The main objective of the Children’s Board was to draft and lead the consultation and finalization process of the Bucharest EU Children’s Declaration and to promote child participation in Europe. UNICEF facilitated the training of the Board as well as several workshops, consultations, press statements, communication and other activities of the Board. As part of the process UNICEF also established a support group comprised of the National Child Rights Authority of Romania, the National federation of Child Rights NGOs and several NGOs. Part of the overall design also included the selection and appointment of 4 Junior Ambassadors to the EU in partnership with the Child Rights Authority and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They were appointed in January, were members of the Children’s Board and represented Romania at several national and international meetings, such as an expert level meeting on child participation, the EU Child Rights Forum, and 2 formal meetings of Council of Ministers.
Lessons learned from the process:

The performance of the Romanian Children’s Board really exceeded anyone’s expectations. Leadership take by the children was impressive, and in all events, they were able to debate and stand their ground with senior Government and EU leaders;
Messages on child rights and child participation are so much more powerful (and legitimate) when they are formulated and presented by children themselves;
The Romanian Junior Ambassadors to the EU were very well received by EU Officials and a great way to get access to the most senior levels of decision makers, beyond what we in a UNICEF can reach;
There is a tendency to confuse child and youth activists. We focused on children only as this is the group (nearly a quarter of the population of Europe) that is in no other way represented, as they have (in most cases) no voting rights and in most societies are perceived as ‘still learning and not responsible nor educated enough to make decisions’ (quote form a Minister);
Partnering with children is nothing like partnering with adults. It requires careful adapted approaches and facilitation, and is not simply about bringing children into an adult situation. A new space needs to be created to bridge the world of children and adults in order for successful sharing of ideas and forming of new ones to happen;
It also requires dedicated safeguarding measures at all levels, including a full-time safeguarding focal point for each event, and significant additional funding;
Globally and in Europe experiences and lessons in area of child participation are still extremely limited and without additional dedicated resources, human and funding, there will be no meaningful child participation.
Lessons learned from MPS Evaluation
Mid 2019, the external evaluation of the Minimum Package of Services (MPS) model was released, showing extremely positive results of the modelling on a wide-variety of child rights indicators in areas of child-poverty, health, education and child protection. The evaluation is the key document around which the scale-up strategy was based. As part of the scale-up, strategy, UNICEF Romania is pursuing multiple avenues in Romania and at the level of the EU. Advocacy with the President of the lower house of Parliament and several MPs of all key ruling and opposition parties, resulted in a MPS law being drafted, which by the end of the year had received endorsement from all political parties. The text was ultimately included as an amendment to the Law on Social Assistance. At the time of writing this report, the law amendment was submitted to the Senate for approval. Advocacy for the law was supported by several communication materials, which included a briefing package as well as a virtual reality movie and installation on the MPS programme.
 
"
ECAR,Serbia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In 2019, the Serbia Country Office (CO) conducted an evaluation of the Country Programme (2016–2020). It found that the country programme is highly relevant to Serbia’s national priorities and EU aspirations, and that UNICEF is responsive to government’s and social partners’ needs and priorities towards closing equity gaps. It also found that the programme has a wide theory of change, which could have benefited from further integration of programmatic interventions and coherence within and across its thematic portfolios. UNICEF’s fitness-for-purpose was challenged by CO thematic and staffing structures that were not fully fit for the nature and scope of its portfolio. Monitoring of child rights in Serbia is a strength of UNICEF; however, monitoring and capturing of UNICEF’s own contribution to the protection of child rights is weak, and analysis and monitoring of assumptions and risks also needs strengthening.
UNICEF has succeeded in positively affecting legislative and policy frameworks as well as institutional capacities across all sectors of support. Improvement of access to services has been achieved through modelled and/or supported services, albeit mostly in the short term as the majority of model services have not been scaled up thus far. A further evaluation of models to identify potential for scale is taking place and will inform the current CPD planning. UNICEF’s strong attention to child rights and their gender dimension ensures that equity principles are applied and helps reaching out to the most vulnerable groups in an appropriate manner. UNICEF is a strong advocate for child rights, though the CO capacity to tackle rooted social norms is limited, affecting the level at which UNICEF can address social change more broadly.
The impact and sustainability of UNICEF support in terms of realization of child rights is fragile. Many factors affect materialization of sustainable impacts, including the level of government absorption capacity and commitment to uptake models; and contextual and financial constraints that surround implementation of adopted legislation and other socioeconomic challenges that the country faces. Importantly, realization of child rights is challenged by rooted social norms and social distance, particularly towards the most vulnerable children, including CWD, minorities and migrants.
The country programme evaluation’s findings are assisting the design of UNICEF’s supported programmatic interventions for the next country programme (2021–2025) and, in particular, the required mix of strategies and roles that are expected from UNICEF in an upper middle-income country. The evaluation was also relevant for further reflection on particular strategies that can facilitate taking programmatic interventions to scale, therefore maximizing results for children and ensuring no child is left behind.
While the Government and line ministries recognize the strategic need for data and evidence-based decision-making, the operationalization and institutionalization of data collection systems requires commitment at different levels of governance. Strong coordination is needed, but sometimes fails due to competing priorities and diverse interests in the long-term planning for data. The partnership in 2019 with the Standing Conference of Towns and Municipalities and the National Academy of Public Administration may partially fill this gap by ensuring that future civil servants are trained not only on child rights, but also on gathering and analysing data.
Ensuring longer-term sustainability of initiatives for children is recognized as a challenge in any context with multiple national priorities. A focus on sustainability and scale-up of programmes and services for children and families will be essential as the current programme nears completion. Advocacy for increased financial commitment from the Government will be needed to create the fiscal space for improving access to and quality of services – especially for vulnerable groups and those living in rural and remote communities. To accelerate results for children, UNICEF is also currently exploring opportunities to develop public–private partnerships.
In a financially constrained environment such as is Serbia, it is understandable that investment in child development should be linked to a clear fiscal framework. For this reason, UNICEF will prioritize cost-benefit analysis across sectors in future advocacy priorities, particularly when increased public expenditure is needed to fulfil children’s rights. Looking ahead, UNICEF Serbia will place stronger emphasis on public finance for children and consider the inclusion of sustainability costings in the scope of pilot programmes, so that a focus on the longer-term investment needed to scale up successful programmes is included from the inception phase.
During 2019, UNICEF Serbia has worked on creating wider capacity for initiating innovative projects in the local environment through mapping teams that are developing innovative solutions which can benefit children. The mapping of innovative companies will help for future cooperation on ideation and implementation of innovative projects that UNICEF Serbia wants to pursue. UNICEF will continue to pursue the use of innovative means for communicating, monitoring programmes and making the voices and power of children and adolescents heard. The priority placed on digitalization by the Government offers multiple opportunities to advance children rights, notably in the field of education, child health and climate change/environment protection.
Climate change, energy access and the environment are also equity issues and addressing them is therefore vital for building a more sustainable future for children. Past national climate, energy and environment analyses have largely been carried out without a child-focused lens, and there are currently no available estimates of the losses incurred by children through underfinancing of climate change action in the short and long-term. In order to fill this gap and to create an evidence base for further child-centred climate action, the Ministry of Environmental Protection and UNICEF will conduct a climate landscape analysis for children, with a particular focus on the effects of climate, environment and energy on children and inequality, identified as an emerging area in Serbia. The analysis should identify specific actions and bankable projects to leverage IFI’s partnerships in this area.
While EU accession is currently the most important strategic objective for Serbia, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has also gained prominence. The renewed focus on the ‘social dimension’ of the EU Western Balkans strategy provides a unique window of opportunity to advance children’s rights by leveraging the EU accession process in conjunction with the 2030 Agenda. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) localization process served as an opportunity to bring together the two key drivers for reform: EU accession and SDG achievement. Nonetheless, more needs to be done to accelerate action to achieving sustainable change, and clear prioritization is required to focus on its main drivers.
Finally, in the framework of UN coherence, the need for more frequent dialogue among agencies on progress and perspectives is crucially needed. Increased frequency will allow for improved analysis of cooperation opportunities and a stronger appreciation of results against the United Nations Development Assistance Framework. Going forward, UNICEF Serbia views UN reform as an opportunity to further embed children’s rights in the UN narrative and action.
 
Staff Wellbeing and Learning
 
Staff wellbeing and learning priorities have been included in the Annual Management Plan of the Country Office and systematic efforts have been put throughout the year in ensuring staff participation in developing a better working environment.
 
With the support of the Staff Association an interim staff survey has been conducted and as a result an Office Improvement Plan has been developed in a participatory manner with consultation with the staff.

 
The office has reintroduced the Learning and Development Committee and devised a 2-year learning plan including, among other, a Business for Results journey for staff which is deemed instrumental to enhance engagement with private sector beyond resource mobilization.
 
The staff structure of the office has been strengthened as a result of the recommendation of RO HR mission that took place in Q4 2018 that has conducted an analysis of the staff structure versus consultants and individual contractors. In the spring PBR submission 5 staff positions have been requested and approved by the Regional Office. All 5 positions have been successfully filled during the year.
 
A Skills Mapping exercise has followed in the last quarter of the year with the support of RO HR providing useful insights on learning needs, especially on the overall influencing competence of the office and change management requirements to ensure a smooth transition to the following Country Programme.
"
ECAR,Tajikistan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The milestone of one-quarter of the SDG lifespan was reached in 2019. It is doubtful if progress towards SDG targets is similarly advanced, in any country. What has, however, become very clear to everyone is that the progress will be impossible without duly nationalising and localising the SDG targets, identifying financing at scale, and efficiently measuring progress.
In Tajikistan in 2019, the CO made significant effort to advance both the SDG nationalisation and localisation agenda. This was through:

supporting the Government’s commitment to develop a National Programme for Children (NPC), fully aligned with SDGs, inclusive of analysis of the financial gap to achieve SDG targets by 2030, and;
initiating or consolidating operationalisation of several global UNICEF partnerships at the country level, including with China, Russia and a number of IFIs;
Nationalising SDGs
As part of the launch of the NPC, all stakeholders were informed on the outstanding financing gap to achieve the agreed SDGs for children in Tajikistan, which amounts to $16.75 billion. Expanding fiscal space to incrementally reduce the financing gap was underscored to be the most important element of further policy planning and programme implementation in Tajikistan. Limited budgetary allocations, in particular to social sectors, compounded by inefficiencies in planning and spending, impede achieving tangible results for children in the country. It is a certainty that if SDG targets are not met for children, the SDGs will not be achieved overall. If a business-as-usual approach continues, the gap in financing will accumulate to an unmanageable volume by 2030 with long-term detrimental effects to the human capital of the country – its biggest asset.  Paradigm shifts in planning, budgeting, financing and implementing must start today.
The need for exploring innovative ways of financing is vital for Tajikistan. UNICEF’s focus on global level partnerships with international finance institutions (IFIs) facilitated discussions with these institutions to localize the partnerships at the country level. UNICEF’s memorandum with the National Development and Reform Council (NDRC) of China created a solid policy framework for transforming infrastructure investments into child-friendly initiatives. This will serve to operationalise commitments at the national level, to test new approaches for better results for children and to localise and ensure financing for the SDGs, which is in the interest of all partners regardless of mandate.
Localizing SDGs
UNICEF, EBRD and AIIB agreed to test our common partnership around the Roghun Bypass Road Project scheduled to be started early in 2020 in two districts of Tajikistan. The partnership involves generating evidence on the vulnerabilities of children living in the catchment zone of a large-scale infrastructure project: assessing the likely impact of infrastructure, consulting with local communities on an action plan to transform the infrastructure area into a child-friendly territory, and ultimately crowding in other investors to create a child-friendly zones using the infrastructure as the catalyst. Implementation of the action plan will be supported by local governments and development partners. The partnership case around the Roghun Bypass Road Project will be studied and a toolkit will be developed to guide UNICEF’s partnerships with IFIs in other countries and contexts.
This collaboration forms the proof of concept for the Belt and Road Initiative for Children (BRI4C), which if successful has the potential to transform the lives of the 235 million poor children living in BRI countries.
Tajikistan CO – with strong engagement with the Dushanbe Mayor’s Office – is finalizing a roadmap to transform the first cohort of 13 cities and districts in Tajikistan into child friendly cities and districts. The CFC initiative will serve as a framework for the implementation of the NPC at sub-national level. The implementation and results will be assessed through a nation-wide child rights monitoring system, currently at beta stage of development with MEDT and the Tajstat.
Advocacy
2019 marked 30 years since the Convention on the Rights of the Child was adopted and went on to become the most ratified piece of document, guiding UNICEF’s work across the continents. Based on global milestones and locally relevant initiatives, UNICEF Tajikistan amplified its advocacy and communication making the 30th birthday of the CRC a theme of the year. It consistently engaged key stakeholders from government, media and business to raise issues of children and win the public support for the cause of children - as part of Vaccines week in April, Parenting month in June, Peacebuilding and (UPSHIFT) Peshsaf Forum on adolescent development, Migration forum on children and families affected by migration. A multifaceted disability inclusion campaign was started across the country reaching over 3 million people (approx. third of the population) through TV, radio and press coverage.  The broadcast was about and with children with disabilities living in the communities, attending school and their interaction with peers. A dedicated Facebook account (with over 106,140 views) induced animated online debates about rights and empowerment of persons with disabilities. 7,000 local officials and community members including youth, adolescents, men and women with/without disabilities were sensitised on social inclusion, with focus on children and women with disabilities. These advocacy efforts culminated in the National Summit for Children co-hosted together with Deputy Prime Minister, where Government publicly presented the national SDG programme for children with the costed analysis and funding gaps. The occasion was also used to introduce new Champions for Children – team of ambassadors who agreed to advocate on pertinent issues related to children in Tajikistan on political platforms and high visibility events throughout 2020.
"
ECAR,Türkiye,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"2019 is the fourth year of the programme cycle and UNICEF Turkey has initiated the planning process for the new CPD along with the UNSDCF in collaboration with the UN system.  Therefore, rather than focusing on 2019, many of the lessons learnt and innovations emerging this year draw on recent evaluations and other evidence-generation activities as part of a broader effort to reflect on this programme cycle in order to inform plans for the next one. . In 2019, UNICEF Turkey completed two evaluations (on community-based child protection services and on UNICEF’s support to education personnel) and is in the process of completing the Country Programme Evaluation, which also evaluates the humanitarian response to the refugee and migrant crisis.
Regarding the humanitarian-development nexus and the use of system-strengthening approaches in a crisis context, the draft CPE report concluded that “the decision to integrate the refugee response within the wider country programme was a bold one and depended on the ability to make existing government policy frameworks and social welfare systems work both for Turkish and refugee populations. The evaluation concludes that this was the right approach and has been largely successful”. The report adds that “this approach on its own could not have met the more acute needs of refugee children in the short term. Support to ‘bridging’ services such as integration of refugee children into the education system, teacher incentives and the community-based child protection scheme, has been a necessary complement to the system-strengthening work”. The evaluation highlights that the success of this approach required flexibility and adjustment to the changing context, saying that “the [humanitarian-development] nexus involved adopting a changing mix of implementation strategies over time, with a relative shift over time away from service delivery and towards system strengthening and capacity development”.
One activity that exemplified the use of systems-strengthening approaches within a crisis context is the collaboration with MoNE on the Education Personnel Management Strategy, particularly in the development of a strategic vision for the Syrian Volunteer Education Personnel’s engagement during and after the transition of Syrian refugee children from TECs to TPSs. Both the CPE draft report and the education evaluation identified the EPMS as a key initiative which contributed substantially to enabling the education system to respond and adjust to the crisis as it evolved
This shift in the portfolio of strategies needs to continue, while still ensuring close monitoring and consideration of the evolving programme environment. The evaluation recommends that UNICEF Turkey capitalize on its proven comparative advantage and play an even stronger role in advocacy and policy dialogue to influence policy and system change for all children living in Turkey. In this respect, the CPE draft report highlights that “UNICEF’s technical advisory role is particularly effective (and appreciated) in this context” and “the trust established has been crucial to UNICEF’s ability to play an expanded role in a context where government has exerted particularly tight control”.
Another important lesson learnt relates to the need for a multi-sectoral approach to programming to ensure an integrated response to children’s needs. The draft CPE concluded that UNICEF “has played a role that perhaps no other international organisation could play in working across sectors and ministries, and in helping bridge the gap between national, provincial and local layers of government”.
An example of this is the CCTE programme, which brings together education, protection, and social policy sectors, and specifically the integration of child protection services into this cash transfer programme.  The draft CPE report states that “the inclusion of a child protection component is innovative and potentially path-breaking”. It further explains that “UNICEF has put effort into strengthening the linkage between child protection and social protection at ministry level. This also creates a potential platform for advocacy to adapt the child protection component to the national CCTE programme, which is lacking this feature so far”. 
Another example of the effectiveness of a multi-sectoral package of interventions and the mobilization of diverse stakeholders is the attempt to bring out of school (OOS) children back to a form of education.  MoNE, MoYS and other government and non-government entities were mobilized at national and local level to identify OOS children, while the Accelerated Learning Program established by MoNE with UNICEF’s support provides certified alternative learning pathway for these children. In addition, recognizing that economic factors are very often the lead cause for school drop-out, the ALP was connected with a social protection scheme (in this case the CCTE). Today, nearly half of the OOS children participating in the ALP have already concluded the relevant ALP cycle and have been referred back to formal education.
In line with the recommendation of the draft CPE to continue working on strengthening cross-sectoral linkages, the new CPD is being designed with a strong intent to promote multi-sectoral strategies and coordination mechanisms. It has also a clear aim to mobilize a broad coalition of different actors - government, CSOs, private sector, human rights monitoring mechanisms and the society at large – that is committed to the children’s agenda in the country.
Another important lesson learnt in 2019 relates to the work on behavioral change and social norms. This area is still incipient as C4D approaches were only recently integrated in the current programming, but are attempting to use a combination of upstream and downstream approaches to promote behavioral change through different platforms such as government services, community systems, and digital,  particularly when it comes to gender norms and promotion of social cohesion between refugees and host communities. These efforts are a good basis to refine the office’s approach to C4D in the upcoming program cycle. As was recommended in the draft CPE, “UNICEF should in the new CPD devise a more coherent and consistent approach to influencing relevant social norms and to promoting social cohesion, in close collaboration with UN and other actors”.  The new CPD is therefore being designed with a strong focus on behavioural and social norm change as key strategy across multiple outputs, especially for programming for early childhood and adolescents.
"
ECAR,Turkmenistan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Long-term transformational planning
As mentioned in the 2018 report when summarizing the SMR discussions, UNICEF started to engage in longer-term planning and scenario building exercises that might not necessarily cover the period of one country programme but were of strategic nature and made sure that our ongoing work with partners were not short-sighted and could be more clearly linked to the country’s development vision and the 2030 agenda. Examples have included the development of an operational plan for the introduction of universal pre-primary education and a ten-year action plan for the development of social service and social services workforce. Both represented important priorities of the country programme, with slow progress so far.
This long-term transformational thinking has already proved to be useful. First, it generated a clearer, more strategic and down-to-earth evidence-based advocacy agenda for UNICEF to follow. Moreover, it helped partners to better understand the pathways and investments needed for the change to happen.
Both partners and UNICEF were thus ready when the opportunity presented itself. The action plan for the development of social services and all the background work it entailed constituted the basis for the development of a joint UN programme, not only ensuring the very much needed financial support from the Global SDG Fund but also mobilizing the RC Office, the whole UN and the Government around introduction of community-based social services in Turkmenistan. As a result, the very ambitious programme will start its implementation in 2020, giving hopes that the objectives of the CPD can still be reached, even if with some delays.
While the implementation of the operational plan for the introduction of one-year universal pre-primary education did not immediately kick off in 2019, the President emphasized the importance of the pre-school education system in public statements, followed by a request to the MoE to develop and submit a programme for this purpose. Although the draft programme is not available publicly, having the operational plan ready ensured that the MoE had enough inputs, scenarios and calculations to develop the draft programme on universal pre-primary education.
Strategic evaluations
The Evaluation of Turkmenistan’s ECD Policy and UNICEF’s contribution to its planning, monitoring and implementation that started in 2019 is going to be the second evaluation during the current programme cycle when UNICEF will be pitching it at a strategic policy level, going beyond UNICEF interventions and looking at the systemic changes in the country. On the one hand, this creates additional challenges particularly considering data limitations and difficulties to evaluate certain criteria, such as efficiency.  On the other hand, however, it is critical that UNICEF support is reviewed within the broader national eco-system, which is particularly important in light of the 2030 Agenda. With evaluation culture very weak, it is important to use every opportunity to strengthen the national systems. Therefore, it has been proposed to establish a reference group for the evaluation, with the co-chairing function divided between the Government and UNICEF and national partners consulted and involved in every stage. 
The evaluation will thus have learning and accountability dimensions, including (i) Learning and improved decision-making (including through identification of lessons learned and good practices) to support ECD policy, with UNICEF and another actors’ support; (ii) capacity development of government and other stakeholders in ECD; (iii) Accountability for UNICEF interventions in terms of contribution to ECD policy and its implementation. This double-fold purpose indicates an evaluation with both formative and summative dimensions. The evaluation is very timely as in December 2019 Turkmenistan approved its next ECD Strategy for 2020-2025 and is now planning to develop its action plan and M&E framework. 
Identifying the right channels for reaching parents
Supporting the national partners in the identification of the right platform and channel for reaching parents and caregivers of young parents has been one of the persistent challenges of the current country programme. With the potential for direct community-engagement being limited, service delivery platforms overstretched and the demand for resources in Turkmen increasing, the office pursued more systematically two channels of communication – radio and digital platforms – in line with its C4D strategy.
Radio programmes on ECD have been put in place within the framework of the established partnership with the State Committee on Radio, Television and Cinematography. It is also planned to cooperate with the Women’s Union and mother groups to be established by them to get feedback on the aired radio programmes and in general understand better their channels of information for further advocacy in the areas related to the next CPD, including nutrition and adolescent health. 
The other initiative, the Internet of Good Things (IoGT) has not moved ahead yet although UNICEF organized several rounds of consultations with the concerned stakeholders, developed a concept note and followed up formally. Such an initiative requires a cross-sectoral buy-in and participation, so it will require more concerted efforts and follow up in 2020. Once adopted the IoGT would allow scale, effectiveness and efficiency of ECD-related outreach considering that internet is enjoying a growing penetration in Turkmenistan, particularly through mobile phones.
"
ECAR,Ukraine,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Presidential and parliamentarian elections in 2019 resulted in a significant change in the political course, with national economic and sectoral reforms often overshadowing the child rights agenda in public discourse. The institutional memory was lost in many ministries in addition to structural changes, all affecting the programme implementation: e.g. inter-ministerial coordination structures were dismantled, or the position of the chair no longer existed. Ministries were also reprofiled, and the lack knowledge and experience of many of the new appointees resulted in delays in prioritizing the child rights agenda. Thus, it became critical to take immediate risk mitigation measures and strengthen the cooperation with local and regional authorities who have all the means and ways to implement the policies under the recent decentralization reform. 
In such a volatile and fast-moving political environment, UNICEF needed to apply a new course of action as the guardian of child rights. Continuous monitoring and an agile response mechanism were especially important in view of the speedy policy and decision-making process that often excludes opportunity for consultations with civic society and other partners. For example, UNICEF was forced to make a statement and prevent the Government from dismantling its well-functioning universal child grant. Efforts will be further required to keep the situation of children at the core of the national agenda and to highlight that as Ukraine moves towards its economic and political goals the situation of children should not be neglected. 
Providing evidence continued to be key for influencing national policies and strategies. Among others, UNICEF supported project on mediation for juveniles in conflict with the law helped to gain evidence and knowledge on the criticality of pre-trial diversion. It resulted in influencing the overall national policy on alternatives to imprisonment bringing the necessary evidence for change of the attitude and knowledge among key decision makers.
Combined incentives (without direct investment), recognition and technical support can boost public spending on children, establish effective cooperation with municipalities, and ensure meaningful implementation of the CRC at the local level. This is true for the CFCI, the new UNICEF supported programme on dezentralized integrated social services in eastern Ukraine, as well as small scale WASH rehabilitation works done at community level. For example, in 2019, 17 CFCI municipalities with approved Action Plans already budgeted UAH 994 million (USD 41 million) for children. Thus, for every USD$1 UNICEF spent on the CFCI, USD$276 was leveraged for children in the country.
Despite positive signs from the new Government towards resolving the conflict, the situation in eastern Ukraine remained volatile and with challenging operational environment. The peculiarities of eastern Ukraine are not always reflected adequately in the national reform agenda: for example, the unique situation of Donbass water companies was not taken into consideration within the energy sector reform. Daily ceasefire violations further impeded the access to certain territories, in addition to posing security risks to the personnel, while the economic blockage of non-government-controlled areas further narrowed the scope of implementation modalities. Effective and regular coordination with local authorities on both sides were maintained helping to avoid any major gaps in implementation.
In future, UNICEF will need a more tailored approach to keep the attention of the impact of the conflict on children high with the media, donor community and Government.
On the innovation front, and related to the CFCI, IT technology and digital solutions were explored and used by UNICEF to address bottlenecks related to data collection and data storage but also for boosting scalability. As such, UNICEF organized its first hackathon in blockchain solutions for municipalities resulting in innovative ideas by and for young people: Waiting list for student dormitories; Streamlining emergency care provision to patients, from ambulance to hospital admission and Charity donations management system.
Another innovative idea was suggested by UNICEF Ukraine to develop the first ever Cyrillic type font for people with dyslexia aiming to support learning outcomes for children with dyslexia. The concept was tested and validated for ease with a substantial test group of 74 children with dyslexia. The font, “Inclusion_UKR” is currently open for non-commercial public access and has a potential to be used in educational materials, children’s books and other printed resources. The font has also a scale potential for use by other countries using Cyrillic alphabet in the region.

ESAR,Angola,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lesson 1: Addressing child rights through private banks engagement 
Partnerships with the bank sector is one of the promising innovative approaches initiated by UNICEF Angola in 2019, building on business relations and corporate social responsibility (CSR) to advance children's rights and strategic social investment.
The pilot project for the country’s first unconditional social cash transfer programme offered opportunity for an innovative partnership with three commercial banks contracted through transparent public bidding for the payment service. Firstly, the social nature of the project, aimed at the most vulnerable children, motivated the banks to waive or reduce to a symbolic amount the costs of transaction for each of the payments. This in-kind contribution saved considerable funding, which is reinvested on children, as part of the banks’ CSR contribution.
Secondly, the engagement of the banks in the payment process further added innovations for a better impact on children and their families. The low levels of identity registration amongst the target population was a major obstacle to ensure the implementation of the programme. After high level advocacy efforts by UNICEF and MASFAMU, the regulator National Bank of Angola and the MINJUSDH authorized to adopt a project’s beneficiary ID card as a valid document to open beneficiary bank accounts, while UNICEF facilitates beneficiaries access to formal civil registration and identification.
Each bank’s approach to the payments offered the possibility of illiterate rural women to open a bank account and access basic financial education, delivered by bank staff. This interaction promotes the financial inclusion of the rural populations, an important component in poverty reduction strategies. The experience   therefore contributed to a change of mindset amongst these banks, as they recognized the business opportunity in facilitating the delivery of social cash transfers as a portal into the wider world of financial services, such as microcredit, and increase of bank account holders in rural areas. Their newly gained experience in this project will place them in a strong position to contribute to the wider financial inclusion agenda in Angola in years to come, benefiting the most vulnerable population. In the pilot phase, over 6,000 families with over 11,000 children under 5 received the child grants and had their knowledge increased on how to use the contributions to invest in education, positive health, nutrition and hygiene behaviors. The added value of private sector engagement, which more effectively combined different stakeholders working on financial inclusion to better understand their roles and responsibilities and to strengthen delivery of social cash transfers, was another important lesson learned.
Another example of private sector engagement in the humanitarian approach is the Safe Havens project, developed in partnership with the Corporate Social Responsibility Department of another private bank. 1.2 million USD were raised by the bank for UNICEF to deliver integrated basic social services, using schools as entry-points, to provide immediate relief and create community resilience for the families in the southern provinces affected by the major climate change-induced drought. The project is implemented through schools in the municipality of Ombadja (Cunene), to provide safe water points, nutritional supplements, community based early learning models to sustain and ensure children are benefiting from the intervention. The quality of teaching, school-based emergency preparedness and response, and community engagement will be reinforced to ensure participation and ownership for long-term sustainability. The overarching objective within this humanitarian-development nexus is modelling: the project will be used as a replicable model for future expansion in other municipalities. 
 
Lesson 2: Use of evidence to challenge gender norms
As part of a programme to promote birth registration and recognizing the need for positive parenting and responsible fatherhood in particular, the MINJUSDH with support from UNICEF and the political buy-in of other ministries and the Angolan Army, launched a national evidence-based initiative: “Responsible Fatherhood: I am in!”. The initiative combines multimedia approaches with key influencers in Angola, and C4D interventions at community level, engaging religious and traditional leaders to promote dialogue with caregivers on the role of fathers in birth registration and caregiving. The initiative is also strategically launched to support the new birth registration policy in hospitals, a model introduced with UNICEF support which has been gradually scaled-up nationwide by the Government.
The decision to promote dialogue on responsible fatherhood in Angola was based on the findings of a formative study on birth registration. The identification of priority groups as the main subjects of paternal abandonment complaints by mothers (taxi drivers, army forces and policemen) was based on official statistics – which was key to reach those men who are more likely to abandon their children. The design of the initiative was informed by the results of interviews and focus group discussions with different male groups and messages were also tested with men of different ages and social conditions.
A study on the impact of mass media campaign shows that 45 per cent of parents who recalled the campaign said it made them change or consider changing the way they care for their children. This rate was higher (55 per cent) among younger parents aged 18-24. Out of the parents reached, 87.7 per cent said they would register their children, noting even higher rates (93 per cent) among younger parents (18-24 years).
The added value of the use of evidence in each phase of the initiative was the most important lesson learned, as the evidence more effectively drove the synergy of combining different approaches. This was pivotal in achieving these positive results in knowledge, attitudes and perceptions.
Based on the lessons learned from the ongoing Country Programme (CP) and following the extensive development process of the new CP 2020-2022, in 2019 UNICEF Angola started adjusting its programme, incorporating geographic convergence and multi-sectoral approaches and strengthening alignment to the national priorities from the NDP 2018-2022, and the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and the SDGs. Furthermore, the CP design and approach of convergent decentralized services, informed the development of the new UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF 2020-2022).
"
ESAR,Botswana,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF has identified three key lessons in 2019. 
Need to refocus efforts away from community-level interventions towards systems strengthening:
In 2019 UNICEF continued to work with local NGOs to test specific proof of concepts. Due to the small size and limited capacity of NGOs in Botswana, a significant amount of time had to be invested in supporting implementation of community-based work. Furthermore, extensive programme and financial assurance activities had to be undertaken to ensure proper implementation and accountability. This called into question, internally, UNICEF’s capacity to successfully implement community level interventions in an extremely resource constrained operating environment.
Further to the above and from an internal UNICEF Botswana review and Government consultations, it was concluded that UNICEF had exhausted its role in testing/implementing integrated Early Childhood Development (iECD) models at community level (an initiative introduced in 2017 as part of the new country programme direction to undertake community level work). UNICEF and respective ministries agreed that it is time for UNICEF to phase out of the piloting and for Government to take the lead, continuing to build the foundation for scale. The 18-month piloting has demonstrated positive results that will inform Government’s decisions on, and design of, community-led iECD. The baseline assessment (undertaken in 4 districts in 2019) and development of iECD materials are also important resources to inform and facilitate ECD efforts in communities. A jointly developed exit strategy for the community ECD work is in place and UNICEF will phase out of this work by mid-2020.
Similarly, UNICEF’s role in the successful piloting of TARL has come to a natural conclusion. Lessons from the 12-month implementation of TARL will be incorporated into the development of a national remediation and enrichment programme which UNICEF will lead.
While phasing out of community level work is not a blanket approach, and is dependent on specific programme resources, UNICEF in Botswana has determined that its value add remains playing a technical advisory function to systems strengthening through policy, strategy and programme planning and design, as well as support to evidence generation. Ongoing piloting of models, for example within the Adolescent and HIV programme, through engagement of a more capacitated NGO will continue for the time being, given resource availability. Re-focusing UNICEF’s role in Botswana will enable optimal impact using the limited budget that the country office has on technical expertise.
In the spirit of renewed focus on systems strengthening, Child Protection programming has also changed course in 2019. Unable to generate significant impact with small interventions and having already developed a Birth Registration Bottleneck Analysis to support Government’s programming decisions, UNICEF decided to move away from direct support to birth registration to instead providing more of a facilitative role. For instance, by identifying the opportunity to use the newly developed NIS in the DHIS2 to increase birth registration. UNICEF will continue to encourage interoperability between the MOHW and the Ministry of Nationality, Immigration and Gender Affairs, for efficiency gains.
UNICEF’s direct interventions have – as reflected in earlier narrative – instead focused on strengthening systems to prevent and respond to violence against children. Complementing social service workforce strengthening, UNICEF intends to advocate for, and offer technical non-financial support to, the Government to strengthen referral procedures/SOPs for existing community structures such as Child Protection Committees and to support the design of Child Friendly Police Stations, with a police force equipped and skilled to address violence against children. UNICEF will also pursue an opportunity to collaborate with UNDP in 2020, leveraging their existing programme interventions to support legal support for child victims and to strengthen the justice system to handle children’s cases.
Need to capitalize on T4D, where possible, for extended reach:
UNICEF Botswana increasingly sees its role as supporting the Government on innovative approaches to address the wellbeing needs of children. This includes technology for development (T4D). 2019 saw an intensification of efforts to use alternative approaches to reach adolescents when it comes to HIV. UNICEF was able to scale up its delivery of HIV prevention, treatment and care initiatives by engaging media, mobile network providers and digi-tech companies. The ability to reach almost 200,000 young people through a radio serial drama using not only radio but also mobile applications, and reaching 20,000 youth by using U-Report, demonstrated the importance of technology to effectively engage adolescents and young people in matters of concern to them. By using digital platforms and technology, it is possible to deliver at scale, the right interventions for young people, at the right time, and using the right approaches to improve programme efficiency and equity and delivery of results. UNICEF will apply this lesson in programme design going forward. This notwithstanding, piloting U-Report alone had generated considerable demand which UNICEF Botswana Country Office must find a way to meet, despite its meagre resources.
Need to reestablish UNICEF’s convenor role amongst like-minded actors:
The Government’s capacity to coordinate actors and stakeholders in the social sector sphere continues to be limited. This has risked duplication of efforts. Therefore, in 2020, UNICEF will build on foregoing efforts to create a collaboration and coordination space within and across sectors, fostering a space to share information, identify bottlenecks and gaps, formulate solutions and converge around advocacy messages. This will strengthen UNICEF’s natural convenor role.
"
ESAR,Burundi,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Maximizing the impact of community-based approaches for greater resilience:
 
In order to provide the most vulnerable with equal opportunities, UNICEF Burundi has tested and implemented the solidarity group approach, sometimes referred to as “Nawe Nuze” [“come, join me” in Kirundi]. Building on the value of solidarity in Burundian communities, the “Nawe Nuze” approach establishes solidarity groups consisting of members of the community that make periodic cash contributions. The solidarity groups are a community-based means to address issues of social protection and functions as a mechanism that can also facilitate access to services in addition to access to informal community support networks.   This approach was first introduced in Burundi by Care International in 2005 and has been used by some UNICEF implementing partners including:  Foi en Action, Foundation Stamm, Solidarité de la jeunesse chrétienne pour la paix et l’enfance, United for Children Burundi, FVS-Amade, International Rescue Committee, Terre des hommes and War Child Holland.
Over the past five years, UNICEF has invested over $2.5 million in the establishment and expansion of Nawe Nuze Solidarity Groups. As a result, there is now a network of 4,157 Nawe Nuze groups, with a female membership rate of 53 per cent, across the country.  A total of 124,439 vulnerable children (81,778 girls) benefited from support by these groups including school enrolment, food, clothing, health care and other support. The groups were instrumental in passing on messages on good parenting, school reintegration and for birth registration. The effectiveness of engaging with solidarity groups was recently validated through a UNICEF-commissioned global evaluation on peacebuilding efforts that included Burundi as a case study. The evaluation recognized that solidarity groups serve as a valuable social network when sheltered in supportive spaces for adolescent empowerment and participation. They contribute to social cohesion and economic self-reliance. In 2020, UNICEF Burundi will invest in a formative evaluation on the effectiveness of these groups in child protection and use the outcome to advocate with national authorities and donors to consider “Nawe Nuze” community solidarity groups in the official national social protection framework.
In addition to the solidarity group model, UNICEF has worked with various partners on other successful community-based approaches such as the “Light Mothers” approach to improving child nutrition and the community-based total sanitation intervention that will be evaluated in early 2020 for possible scale-up. 
Such platforms are fertile ground for passing on key messages for behavior change on a range of themes such as nutrition, hygiene, ECD, violence prevention and peacebuilding, among others.
2. Adapting innovative programming for adolescents in Burundi
The introduction of innovative adolescent programming may not seem as an obvious choice in a context such as Burundi, which is overwhelmingly rural with a high rate of poverty and limited private sector space. Yet the country office was ready to tackle this challenge, considering the growing size of the adolescent population, the drive to leave no one behind and the importance of adolescent girls and boys being exposed to opportunities to learn about innovative thinking and the impact of social innovation.  It is noteworthy that the Government came on board very quickly as the theme of entrepreneurship and employment for young people is one of the priorities of the National Development Plan (2018-2027).    
Thus, capitalizing on lessons learned from other countries, in 2019 UNICEF introduced the concept of UPSHIFT to Burundi, and with it the Adolescent Innovation Lab, making Burundi the first francophone country in Africa to do so. The benefit of this platform is that it serves multiple purposes:  it introduces innovative and entrepreneurial twenty-first century thinking to adolescents, including the most vulnerable; it serves as an additional platform for fostering the participation of adolescents in the lives of their communities; and it helps build greater sense of social cohesion and as such is a means to achieve peace and integration of displaced or returnee/repatriated adolescents in host communities. 
The 2019 pilot of UPSHIFT has served to find entry points to ensure that this methodology is adapted to the country context.  For example, one lesson learned is the critical need to leverage existing community structures such as the solidarity groups to sustain gains from UPSHIFT, mobilize the community around innovative solutions proposed by adolescents and eventually provide them with access to credit so that they can implement their vision. In Burundi, where radio is still an important conduit for information-sharing, the use of radio programming with UPSHIFT maximizes its country-wide reach and penetration. 
The programme will be integrated as one of the pillars of skills-building and referral for adolescents.   The adolescent investment case study also served to model the programme and the benefit-cost ratio of this approach was proven more than advantageous.  
3. Leveraging partnerships for scale:  
As Burundi is a relatively small country, initiatives that are proven to yield results can be taken to scale with strengthened coordination among development partners and between the Government and development partners.  Hence UNICEF actively participates in and/or leads dialogue for improved synergy, generating evidence and knowledge that can create the impetus for more coordinated approaches.  Examples of such partnerships  are the joint high-level event on nutrition in Burundi in coordination with the Government of Burundi, the SUN platform, WFP, the Governments of Netherlands and Switzerland;  the joint programming on nutrition with FAO and WFP; the joint programming on peacebuilding with UNESCO and UNFPA;  the joint programming on women’s livelihoods and child care with UNDP; the joint efforts with WHO and IOM on Ebola preparedness as part of a consortium; the technical support to the World Bank-financed programme on cash transfers; the membership and co-leadership of the newly developed technical platform, policy advisory group for improved technical and development partner coordination since 2019, and the active participation in resilience planning with the Resident Coordinator and other sister agencies.
"
ESAR,Comoros,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Two factors have delayed programme implementation in Comoros in 2019: the electoral process in a difficult political climate, which ended with the confirmation of the president at the end of March 2019; and tropical cyclone Kenneth which made landfall on 24 April 2019 affecting 345,000 people – 46 per cent of the population.
The year tested the country and UNICEF capacity to respond to an emergency on a national scale. Lessons and recommendations on future preparedness were documented during a Cyclone Kenneth Lessons Learned Workshop, as well as during an evaluation carried out by the Capacity for Disaster Reduction Initiative (CADRI). The emergency underscored the need for a comprehensive preparedness, response and resilience strategy – both in terms of emergency response and risk communication. One specific challenge identified was the absence of an emergency-situation communication for development (C4D) plan, and no coordination structure. This challenge had been addressed in time for the expected landfall of Cyclone Belna, which narrowly deviated from the Comoros in December 2019. In terms of emergency preparedness, an operational communication plan was developed, and a multisectoral emergency communication group was set up under UNICEF leadership.
For the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) sector, emergency lessons included: (a) the importance of prepositioned contingency stock, especially in a situation where air shipment is prohibitively expensive and would take too long by sea; (b) that the emergency cash transfer, organized with the social protection sector, has demonstrated its efficiency in responding to the immediate needs of the affected population – and this modality should be formalized within the national contingency plan and the sector response plan; (c) that there are capacity gaps: WASH actors other than the National Civil Security Directorate and the Comorian Red Crescent were not familiar with humanitarian assessment tools, which resulted in slow, inefficient data analysis in an emergency context; and (d) that the current water supply system is not resilient, with most pumping stations in Ngazidja relying on a fragile source of energy.
UNICEF has also embraced innovation and integration of new technologies. The use of smartphones and online platforms such as KoBoToolbox continues to prove its efficiency for quickly deploying surveys and collecting data. Building on the previous years’ work, the Comoros Water Information System (SIEC) developed by UNICEF in collaboration with the National Directorate of Water and Sanitation became operational on all three islands. SIEC uses mobile phone technology to collect data and store it online. This technology has proven its relevance and agility in the aftermath of the cyclone, as a new water infrastructure inspection module was developed and distributed to public servants in a matter of days, allowing for a prompt and reliable assessment of damage to water infrastructure following Cyclone Kenneth. This experience has fuelled interest in extending mobile-technology-based data collection to the immunization and education sectors.
UNICEF is also looking for further ways to accelerate community access to improved sanitation. An innovative project makes use of the popular community saving scheme to help overcome cash flow obstacles to investing in improved toilets. Early indicators suggest this approach has considerable potential; as with sanitation marketing, it will likely take a number of years to reach scale.
UNICEF continues to advocate for a better enabling environment for water, sanitation and hygiene in the country. The absence of a dedicated budget allocation, stagnant policy and institutional reform, and annual changes of line ministries point to low prioritization of this sector. At the same time, public servants remain committed to improving the situation within their role. The need for continuous high-level advocacy remains critical, alongside capacity strengthening at the operational level to make progress for the well-being of children.
In the education sector, UNICEF has worked together with the Ministry of Education to launch mobile-phone-based platforms to improve official communication and reporting between the school, district, and ministry levels. The initiative is being implemented in the 50 public primary schools chosen as pilots for the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) Transitional Education Project for the Union of the Comoros (PTEUC), and staff have been trained on reporting relevant information using a smartphone. Early signs are promising and may lead to a further scale-up.
Similarly, UNICEF has worked in coordination with the Ministry of Health to develop a concept for an electronic immunization registry to record and track child immunization records at the local level using an online platform and tablets and/or smartphones. This concept, which is under review, is expected to address weaknesses in routine immunization in the country.
Coordination bottlenecks were encountered in the parenting programme supporting early childhood development. The current programme focuses on strengthening the capacities of parents in their role as educators and caregivers to enable young children to develop to their full potential and prepare for school. The programme is implemented chiefly by the network of community health workers employed by the Ministry of Health. Poor collaboration between the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education has prevented the implementation of activities such as awareness-raising sessions on hygiene, nutrition and preschool education, despite the provision of parental education guides and trainers' guides to the island authorities. The guides were developed under the leadership of the Ministry of Education, which is now looking to work with school councils and mayors, with whom they have already started parental education activities, rather than community health workers.
As part of its work on post-cyclone reconstruction, UNICEF has specified the use of energy-saving lamps (LEDs) in all new and refurbished health facilities. With support from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the office has also introduced solar-powered water pumps as a climate-resilient option in order to avoid the use of fossil fuels.
Following the release of the Independent Task Force Report on Workplace Gender Discrimination, Sexual Harassment, and Abuse of Authority, the Comoros Country Office developed and adopted an action plan addressing the key recommendations. The plan is being implemented and monitored by the Country Office Joint Consultative Committee and the Local Staff Association. 
 
"
ESAR,Eritrea,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"One of the key lessons learned in 2019 was the importance of moving beyond national averages to look at the most vulnerable populations, often located in very remote areas. In education, while MLA results and enrolment data showed some improvement and the number of districts implementing the minimum package for FGM/UAM elimination increased, a closer look at specific ethnic groups and communities suggested that their situation may be quite different. UNICEF needs to strengthen its equity focus across programmes and, even in absence of official data, utilize programme data and negotiate with partners to reach out to the most marginalized groups. This will present a serious challenge, as sector needs are substantial, and UNICEF is often the only partner.
Through its high level of commitment, accountability and self-reliance, Eritrea offers an excellent opportunity for taking most key community-based interventions to scale to achieve universal coverage, thereby contributing to achievement of the SDGs. Evidence of this potential is demonstrated through the country’s high immunization coverage, high coverage of preventive and curative nutrition programmes, rapid scale-up of community-led total sanitation (from late 2018 into 2019) and, more recently, the scale-up of new-born care interventions. While most of these interventions are low-cost, they have proven to be very effective in reducing morbidity and mortality. With a carefully selected, strategic and diverse portfolio of partnerships it is quite possible to take such interventions to full scale in Eritrea. Universal coverage, however, can only be achieved by going the extra mile to identify and specifically target underserved communities and missed children through various strategies, including integrated outreach services.
Despite a lack of both clear system and a uniform birth registration system, some sub-zobas have begun to use immunization cards, baptism cards and other relevant verifications of age to prevent UAM. This best possible alternative option was discussed by the national technical committee, which encouraged zoba and sub-zoba offices to document and systematically promote the practice in other sub-zobas to put an end to UAM. UNICEF participates in these discussions as a member of the technical committee, chaired by the MoH.
Sports competition in schools served to strengthen resilience in communities and empower civic engagement by children and adolescents. Given limited opportunities for children and adolescents to engage in extracurricular activities at school, sports competitions can contribute to keeping them in school and strengthening their physical and mental fitness, offering positive learning in and outside the classroom, and provide them with opportunities for civic engagement, contributing to their overall social development. UNICEF will continue to explore further opportunities to engage with children through sports – potentially by expanding and strengthening its partnership with the NUEYS.
UNICEF played a lead role in developing a draft proposal to the joint SDG Fund for Social Protection: Leaving No One Behind, following consultations with participating UN organizations. The draft proposal targeted people with disabilities, including children, to ensure their livelihood, health, education and entrepreneurship (linking to SDG Goals 1, 3, 4, 8 and 16). The proposal was not considered by the UN Country Team, which submitted a different proposal that was not shortlisted for funding by the SDG Joint Fund Secretariat. In addition, the UNDP in consultation with UNICEF submitted a joint proposal to strengthen youth entrepreneurship by introducing and scaling up the manufacture of a fuel-efficient stove designed by a team of Eritrean youth with the aim of curbing the rural energy shortage, health hazards, deforestation and rural poverty. This submission was also not selected. In the entire bidding process for this competition one of the learning for UNICEF Eritrea was that such efforts require a series of technical consultations, considerable time to discuss and design implementable projects and utmost care to draft technically sound and financially viable proposals.
The office faced challenges for implementing the planned technology for development (T4D) initiative, mainly because the operational environment was not conducive. Despite this challenge, the office sought to explore the national environment to identify opportunities and entry points for initiating T4D projects. Efforts were carried out by the WASH unit, as part of preparing a proposal for WASH inventory data collection, and the education team, in relation to data collection from 90 schools in five zobas and a digital library in Asmara. Visits to local telecommunications providers were conducted to learn more about their services which can be a platform for future T4D projects.
"
ESAR,Eswatini,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"One of the key lessons learned by the Eswatini CO was that enhanced strategic oversight, coordination and accountability of senior management leads to improved implementation and achievement of results for children. During the reporting year, UNICEF and the Ministry of Health (MoH) senior management team initiated the process of monthly meetings at senior management level to assess the progress on the implementation of the rolling workplan and ensure timely interventions by senior management in areas where bottlenecks were identified. For example, when there was a delay in transfer of funds by Ministry of Finance to UNICEF Supply Division for procurement of vaccines, this was addressed timely through joint advocacy efforts by UNICEF and the MoH senior management. In addition, approval of key strategic documents such as the “Guide to Integrated Programming and Service Delivery”and “Sanitation and Hygiene Strategy” were fast-tracked. This platform also resulted in achievement of 92% of the planned rolling workplan results for 2019. UNICEF Eswatini’s investment in high level advocacy training for all staff, development of and implementation of a CO policy advocacy plan has contributed to improved advocacy on child issues and results for children.
Another key lesson learned was creating a culture of “shared accountability” for all key country office performance indicators (KPIs) by all staff, which was found vital for the improved and sustained country office performance in 2019. In 2018 and throughout 2019, the country office performance on all KPIs maintained no less that the top five position in the region, and this was a result of collective staff efforts in developing, implementing, monitoring and reporting on work plan targets against organizational priorities. Towards this goal, Eswatini CO received a Regional Management Indicator Award 2018 for “Best Performance in Quality Assurance”. The country office also received recognition for being one of the first countries to complete its performance appraisal evaluations, and for this achievement the CO earned itself an onsite training session on Career Conversations from UNICEF HQ. These positive outcomes are also attributed to the CO investment in ongoing staff capacity including Emotional Intelligence (EI).  EI trainings were supported jointly by the COSA and senior management. Application of EI has generally improved office culture and staff-to-staff work interactions, contributing to a positive culture in the office and a conducive environment for work.  
Innovation 
To improve quality of health care service delivery, an innovative real-time Client Satisfaction Feedback Mechanism (CSFM) was implemented by the Ministry of Health (MoH) Quality Assurance / Quality Improvement Programme with technical and financial support from UNICEF. Modelled on the UNICEF U-Report platform, the CSFM was developed through integration of Rapid-Pro and the MoH Client Management Information System (CMIS) currently installed in 178/334 health facilities. The main purpose of establishing the CSFM was to encourage citizen engagement in contributing towards improved delivery of quality health care services by health facilities.
The CSFM is a Short Message Service (SMS) based system and it triggers clients to provide real-time feedback on quality of service received at the health facility.  The system generates dashboards on the client feedback data both at health facility and national level. The Quality Assurance /Quality Improvement Programme use these dashboards to track and monitor facility performance at national level, whilst health workers at facility level can view the dashboard for their own health facility and use the information to improve service delivery.
The SMS-based system for the CSFM is configured on reverse billing at 5 cents per SMS by both the country’s Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), Eswatini Mobile and Eswatini MTN. There is no charge to the client for sending feedback through SMS to the health facility. The reverse billing rate was negotiated with the MNOs by UNICEF in collaboration with MoH. Currently UNICEF is paying the MNOs and MoH will take over after six months.
Even though the CSFM has recently been established, officials at all levels within MoH especially health care workers at health facilities have received it with resounding approval and excitement. The CSFM will be rolled out to the remaining 156 health facilities as soon as MoH completes installing CMIS in all the health facilities. There are no reported challenges yet since operationalization of the new system has just started.

ESAR,Ethiopia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The year 2019 was the last year of the current country programme that will end in June 2020. It was also a year of transition in management with changes in three senior positions in the office, in addition to two new section chiefs and three new chiefs of field offices. As part of the process for developing the new UNICEF Ethiopia Country Programme 2020-2025, a number of analyses were undertaken, including a Country Programme Evaluation, a Perceptions Study among Key UNICEF partners and a Gender Review. The Office looked also at its approach to humanitarian action and its engagement with the Government in terms of its support to institutional strengthening. UNICEF is also fully engaged in the shaping of the 2020-2025 United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF), in particular providing data/analysis for the Common Country Assessment and in designing outcomes and outputs which encompass the Humanitarian-Development-Peace nexus.  
Four key lessons emanating from these reviews will be presented here. First is the need for UNICEF to strengthen programme focus and narrow scope in a more integrated manner. To this end, Government and UNICEF identified four flagship results which will be addressed in the context of the 20202-2025 Country Programme in an integrated manner, notably: End Child Marriage; End Open Defecation; Stop Stunting; and All Children Access Learning Opportunities. In addition, prioritized activities were identified in selected regions to “do less, but better”, and there will be increasing resources for system strengthening, evidence generation and leveraging fiscal space in favor of better services and results for children.
Second is the need to improve work processes and efficiency, especially stronger monitoring and accountability with/by partners. To this end, Government and UNICEF set up a Task Force to review and streamline their partnership implementation modality; work planning will move from one year to rolling workplans in line with UNICEF global guidelines, and work will be done to simplify work processes without losing accountability, and training will be done for partners on financial and programme reporting procedures. In particular, and concerning effectiveness and efficiency of the approach adopted so far for support to institutional strengthening and capacity development among partners, UNICEF in Ethiopia will partner with UN agencies and development partners to a more structured process for assessing capacity development needs and developing a harmonized strategy with those partners to avoid duplication and ensure that the support provided contributes to Government’s capacity to achieve the ambitious targets it set for itself in the Home Grown Economic Reform Agenda and the long perspective development plan.
Third is the need for UNICEF to be a stronger voice and advocate for children and widen its partnerships in that regard.  To this end, UNICEF will build a solid advocacy strategy with partners including with UN, CSOs, and the media around the flagship results since those require large-scale mobilization. As part of the next country programme, a number of legal and policy frameworks points affecting children were identified informed by a comparative analysis carried out on the concluding observation and recommendations of the Universal Periodic Review (2019), Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (2019), Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2016), Convention on the Rights of the Child (2015) and African Convention on the Rights of Women and Children (ACRWC 2014). At policy level, thanks to UNICEF advocacy a national campaign to combat open defecation was launched; the formation of a Nutrition Council is in the final stages; the Ministry of Education agreed to embark on an Education Act.
Fourth is the need for UNICEF to strengthen its humanitarian action. This is critical especially given the experience of increased inter-ethnic conflict during 2019 and the upcoming elections in 2020. Ensuring sustainable cluster leadership especially in education and child protection will be critical, putting in place mechanisms for stronger partnerships that enable swift response to rising emergency situations, as well as a better articulation of the link between humanitarian and development action are critical and will be a priority in 2020 UNICEF Ethiopia’s plans.  
The office continued its efforts in creating a healthy work environment. In addition to several sensitization sessions on Organizational Values and Workplace Culture, the office conducted surveys to get feedback from staff on potential challenges in creating a safe space and encouraging a speak-up culture. A dedicated Culture Change Action Plan has been developed and regular follow up is made on the same. The office also invested in strengthening confidential reporting mechanisms for raising issues on workplace harassment, as well as is demonstrating from management the commitment to take necessary and timely action.
"
ESAR,Kenya,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"One of the important lessons learned during 2019 was that aligning to county priorities by incorporating child-focused priorities in the County Integrated Development Plans (CIDPs) facilitates increased budget allocations services affecting children. All 47 county CIDPs reflect child priorities, but there is a disconnect between the CIDPs, allocation of budgets and actual budget spending. For example, counties are not meeting the Public Finance Law requirement of allocating and spending at least 2 per cent of their budgets on emergencies and disaster response. There is an opportunity for UNICEF to enhance engagement in CIDP and budget processes at the county level in a coherent manner which would emphasise the connections between data, vulnerabilities, prioritisation of sectors and budgeting. There is also room for enhancing inter-governmental coordination between counties and national government at the county level, and within sectors at the county level.
Another lesson learned around humanitarian interventions is that supporting government services among refugees strengthens the relationship between humanitarian response and development, enhancing resilience. UNICEF continues to support commitments made by the Kenyan Government to develop integrated settlements for refugee and host communities to enhance livelihood opportunities and streamline service delivery. In this regard, UNICEF’s efforts to strengthen the relationship between humanitarian response and development in Kenya has included UNICEF’s child protection efforts in refugee settings, which previously fell to NGO partners. UNICEF has been at the forefront of a strategic shift that seeks to include actions related to child protection in humanitarian settings in longer term national child protection systems in Kenya. Through UNICEF’s efforts, a national level curriculum for frontline child protection staff will now be implemented in refugee hosting areas for camp case workers.  To increase the engagement of the Department of Children Services (DCS) in refugee camps, UNICEF hosted the first ever mission by the DCS to the Kakuma refugee camp in Turkana. This resulted in a commitment by the DCS to deploy additional children’s officers in refugee hosting sub-counties that are currently served by only one officer. Additional personnel will ultimately boost sustainability, continuity of service and inclusion of refugee children in the national child protection system.
One of the most significant innovations that UNICEF invested in during 2019 was the Cash-plus Energy approach within the scope of the Mwangaza Mashinani programme. Through the provision of a solar device, voluntarily repaid through additional cash top-ups, school-going children from vulnerable families were able to study in the evenings, after completing their household chores. As most of these cash beneficiaries are single mothers or widows, they are also encouraged to engage in income generating activities such as using solar devices to charge phones of neighbours. The payment scheme for the solar energy is flexible and adapted to the circumstances of poor families, which means it is a business model that can be scaled up by the private sector in hard-to-reach areas.
UNICEF has engaged with the private sector and academia to address gaps in essential medical equipment. A well-equipped and fully functional “Maker Space” lab was established at University of Nairobi (UoN) to facilitate the development of innovative health technology and solutions in the field of maternal, newborn and child health. Innovators from Kenyatta National Hospital, UoN and the private sector were trained in advanced calibration, marketing, user-centred designs and design-thinking processes.
Through a six-week hackathon training programme, more than 40 participants gained knowledge in product development and the processes to produce prototype designs. Participants worked with hospital clinicians to understand shortcomings in certain medical devices. As a result, several prototype devices were developed including a suction machine, phototherapy, and examination light, and are now undergoing clinical testing. If proven successful, the intention is to manufacture the devices locally and support the government’s agenda to increase access to affordable, essential lifesaving medical equipment for mothers and newborns.
UNICEF invested in automation of systems to improve collaboration, knowledge management and efficiency. In 2019 UNICEF implemented Enterprise Content Management (ECM) as the organisation’s major productivity and collaboration platform. ECM implementation involved training focal points in the toolset, site management and archiving. UNICEF further implemented systems to facilitate Supply and Logistic functions including e-bidding, a mobile warehouse and inventory management system, and set up an electronic contracts review committee.  UNICEF also invested in staff training on e-tools for more effective information management on partnerships. For improved payment management, a “Push and Track” system was implemented. A cellular based vehicle tracking system was launched to enhance staff safety in the field and ensure fuel efficiency.
Solar electricity generation was added to zone offices in Kisumu, Lodwar and Garissa. These grid-tied systems generate electricity and reduce the carbon footprint of the offices by eliminating diesel generators. The solar systems provide back-up power for communications and allows them to continue to support field operations during grid outages.
Significant staff and management attention was given to furthering management excellence in the office. In response to the Independent Task Force Report on Workplace Gender Discrimination, Sexual Harassment, and Abuse of Authority, all staff meetings were convened, focus groups met and an action plan was developed addressing priority issues. Senior managers all underwent a 360-degree assessment with findings informing development plans. A second cohort of managers attended the Management Masterclass training, and living UNICEF’s core values was emphasised regularly at staff gatherings. Additional capacity to support learning and development was added to the HR team. The country office completed a training needs analysis, a learning and development plan, and piloted new initiatives such as internal cross-functional job shadowing and interview skills training. Clear guidelines on stretch assignments were issued offering equal opportunities for all levels of staff.
"
ESAR,Lesotho,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Goal area 1
Onsite mentorship, as opposed to workshop-based training, was found to be more effective in helping health personnel apply their skills. For example, the application of perinatal death review (PDR) for the reduction of neonatal mortality in all 17 Government hospitals resulted in PDR being used as a measurement tool for MNH quality of care. Additionally, three of the 17 hospitals are using PDR as a staff-management planning tool.
Engagement of district officers in the adaptation/development of key documents (guidelines, SOPs, data collection tools) encouraged them to immediately adjust their work and accelerate results for children and women.
In nutrition, the scale-up of the MNP programme will require intensive social mobilization to dispel misconceptions that prevent caregivers from returning for MNP refills. In addition, there is a need to synchronize the MNP schedule with the EPI schedule to encourage greater uptake.
In HIV, socio-cultural beliefs remain significant barriers to HIV testing, care and treatment for AYPs. UNICEF will support MoH to use the results of the KAPN study to further analyse the structural bottlenecks at the community level. UNICEF is introducing U-Report as a tool to improve effectiveness of programmes by engaging children and adolescents in the development process. Over 12,000 adolescents and young people will be targeted in Phase 1, with plans to expanded beyond SRHR/HIV in Phase 2.
Goal area 2
The ongoing teachers’ strike and changes in ministerial leadership slowed progress in late 2019, resulting in the delayed development of ESA and ESP. UNICEF will continue to engage at the ministerial-level, but a key lesson is that engagement at the technical level needs to be strengthened and sustained, and champions at technical level need to be identified in order to accelerate progress. The appointment of UNICEF as the coordinating agency of the LEG will better position UNICEF as key partner, allowing us to facilitate discussions and engage stakeholders to ensure improved accountability.
The budget allocation to ECE (less than 0.5%) is a challenge for national scale up reception-year classes. In line with UNICEF’s global commitment of 10 per cent to ECE, UNICEF will continue to advocate for greater resource allocation for ECE with MoET and MoF.
The CFS evaluation identified several challenges with the implementation of CFS in Lesotho. This calls for a revised implementation strategy with a revised training approach, which UNICEF will pursue in 2020.
Goal area 3
Limited resources for the child protection programming is a challenge. To avoid being spread too thinly and losing impact, in 2020, UNICEF will provide more focused support, following the completion of VACS and updated MICS data. UNICEF will support Government in strengthening referral mechanisms for survivors of violence, particularly in schools and communities. Support will also be given to the roll-out of the CRVS action plan and the establishment of a social welfare workforce to provide decentralized protection services.
Goal area 4
The Department of Rural Water Supply has been facing institutional bottlenecks to shift its approach from full subsidy to targeted subsidy of rural sanitation, hindering implementation of the Community-Led Total Sanitation approach and elimination of open defecation. Following sustained advocacy and the UNICEF-supported WASH bottleneck analysis, the sector is currently developing a revised rural sanitation approach, which will be piloted and fully implemented in 2020.
Goal area 5
The Government, EU and UNICEF continue to invest substantially in social protection. However, cyclical and protracted emergencies pose serious challenges to people’s livelihoods and access to basic social services. Based on the evaluation report of the livelihood programme and various studies, UNICEF and the EU are supporting the Government in making the social protection system more shock-responsive to strengthen the coping capacities and resilience of the poorest communities affected by humanitarian crises.
UNICEF supported the Government to use geographic information system to make sure no household is excluded from the National Information System for Social Assistance and initiate mobile payment to reduce operational cost.
With dedicated capacity in UNICEF on public finance and an MOU with MoF, UNICEF has been able to enhance the capacity of relevant officials and increase participation and accountability.
UNICEF led and supported the finalization and launch of the 2018 MICS (18 years after the last MICS in Lesotho). Knowing that the cost of MICS would be beyond the CO budget, UNICEF was able to leverage the resources required (US$1.5 million from partners) resulting in much-needed data for planning and programming.
Cross-cutting areas
Let Youth Lead demonstrated how a service can become youth-friendly when there is constant evidence-based dialogue between service providers and clients.
There is need for capacity building of partners on C4D. Coordination of C4D, particularly at Government level, has been a constraint for systematizing interventions. As more and more partners, including Government ministries such as MoH, are beginning to understand and appreciate the application of C4D, capacity building of partners should be possible.
In 2020, there will be less emphasis on piloting and more on supporting Government to scale up proven interventions and concepts. Cross-sectoral linkages in ECD and adolescents will continue to be strengthened to maximize impact. Efforts will continue to strengthen the nexus between UNICEF’s development and humanitarian activities.   
Programme and operational effectiveness
The findings and recommendations from key reports such as MICS, VACS, LePHIA, the CFS evaluation and the SRHR/HIV KAPN study will be used to improve programme effectiveness in 2020. UNICEF recruited a Research and Evaluation Specialist to strengthen the quality of data and evaluations. Furthermore, UNICEF will support the Ministry of Development Planning to develop a National Monitoring and Evaluation Policy.
Lessons learned from the implementation of quality assurance activities include the need for the Country Office to provide financial resources and capacity building for implementing partners to act on the findings. Close monitoring of items contributed to timely submission of donor reports and efficient utilization of financial resources. Brown-bag trainings worked well and provided clarity on key policies to staff. Cash-flow forecasting is still a challenge in the office. Significant efforts are needed to ensure that the office closes with the minimum cash required at the end of the month. 
"
ESAR,Madagascar,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons learned: 
While the smooth transition of the Government was well recognized by the international community, the time required for the new administration to become operational affected programme implementation. UNICEF’s actions to mitigate these delays included expanding our partner base to work more with NGOs and local government and strengthening clusters coordination. 
The 2019 Audit findings and recommendations related to monitoring of Cash Transfer to partners, and supply management provided strong evidence that Governance and system strengthening for financial risk management continues to be a challenge in Madagascar. The political transition has provided a good opportunity to advocate with the government to adopt more disciplined approach, with positive results. However, this requires significant investments in training, monitoring and control, including frequent recourse to third party monitoring. The costs of doing business need to be built more clearly into future programmes.  
Madagascar mobile phone coverage is limited with a penetration rate estimated at 40 per cent. Internet connectivity is even more limited with an estimated 15 per cent penetration rate. While most medium to small cities are now covered by services, access to electricity is also estimated to be less than 25 per cent. Therefore, Madagascar is rapidly reaching the limits of technology-based solutions for data, communication, education or management. This can strongly impact end user monitoring or systems using Rapid Pro or other mobile platforms. 
Innovations: 

Mobilisation and advocacy on pollution as a silent killer. Estimates suggest that pollution kills more than malaria and TB in Madagascar. UNICEF partnered with NGO Pure Earth to mobilise Government, donors and civil society partners on the issue of pollution. After an initial workshop, the Ministry of Health organized a follow up symposium on air quality and a follow up meeting to develop concrete response plans is planned in 2020 
         
WASH Satellite mapping and early warning systems. With support from the European Union, UNICEF launched a remote detection of water sources in the south of Madagascar, which has been completed in 2019 by two key tools: a Groundwater Early warning system using piezometers to alert on water table depletion, and a “normalized difference vegetation index” which uses vegetation growth as a proxy for drought impact assessment. These are compiled into a monthly report and shared with cluster stakeholders. 
         
Use of Cactus to promote resilience and accelerate social and sustainable economic development in drought affected regions. UNICEF promoted the utilisation of cactus in the south to increase income and nutritional intake. More than 150 stakeholders including government officials, donors and more importantly private sector participated in the event which aimed at transforming a burden (limited agricultural assets in the south) into a development opportunity thanks to a sharing of successful international experiences and local best practices. 
UNICEF Madagascar shall pursue its dual policy of first supporting large scale, low-cost high-impact interventions and then continue exploring new and more efficient and sustainable ways to accelerate the operationalization of children rights in Madagascar in 2020.
"
ESAR,Malawi,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Key lessons learned for the CO in 2019 were derived from the application of innovative approaches informing programme implementation, the emergency response to cyclone Idai providing valuable insights for strengthened preparedness, and from the implementation of an innovative change management process reinforcing the impact of UNICEF Malawi programming on child wellbeing.   
To strengthen the implementation, effectiveness and focus of UNICEF Malawi programmes, innovative approaches like real-time data collection, geo-information and satellite imagery were used to inform programme design. The RapidPro-based Nutrition Commodities Tracking System was scaled up nationally. U-Report, a free mobile-based opinion polling service, collects regularly perspectives from more than 180,000 young Malawians. The platform was also used to strengthen emergency awareness and preparedness. Some 60,000 early warning messages were issued during the year reaching all U-Reporters and their families in flood-prone areas. The Child Protection Information Management (CPIM) was migrated to the RapidPro platform and, following a pilot phase, was scaled up nationally and is now successfully used by the Police, the National Child Justice Forum, and the MoGCDSW. Collected data are organised and analysed into a common infrastructure under the 4P2C data platform developed during the year (https://malawi.4p2c.org/portal/home/). Several proofs of concept and applications of the 4P2C platform were tested during the year, including provision of information on geographic accessibility to health facilities, a cholera response mapping, monitoring of latrines construction, mapping of social protection financial service providers, study of the river Shire for flood predictability and use of data for cyclone Idai flood response. Statistical modelling was used to develop a continuous epidemiological platform to predict disease outbreak.
One of the most successful innovations fully deployed and used in programmes and emergency response was UNICEF Malawi’s drone for good programme implemented in partnership with Malawi’s Ministry of Transport and with support from GLOBHE (Sweden), NextWing (USA), Wingcopter (Germany), and UAVAid (UK). The first Africa Data and Drone Academy (ADDA) was established in 2019 in collaboration with the Malawi University of Science and Technology and the first cohort of students is expected to graduate in March 2020. The CO is also working with the Department of Disaster Management Affairs to integrate drones into emergency responses.
Innovative ideas in the field of renewable energy and sustainability were explored through a joint UNDP-UNICEF Malawi energy needs assessment on the use of sustainable energy services in health facilities. The CO established a Green Team to promote energy efficiency and reduce waste and carbon footprint from UNICEF Malawi’s operations and programmes.
As evidenced from the cyclone Idai evaluation, UNICEF Malawi provided significant support to the government-led response and early recovery efforts, especially in areas of strengthened emergency coordination (including through clusters), critical service delivery, prevention of “double disasters”, such as cholera outbreaks, and implementing Prevention from Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (PSEA) initiatives. UNICEF Malawi’s willingness to advance significant reserve funding to kick-start the response, disaster preparedness and in-country, regional and global surge mechanisms helped to fill critical capacity gaps and deliver life-saving services. While the CO response was assessed as timely and delivered with quality, some important gaps were identified particularly in regard to the need for a structured and strategic transition from relief to recovery through agile programme restructuring and investments, heightened attention to programmes addressing the need of vulnerable groups, such as children with disability, women and girls, and strengthened accountability to affected populations in the post-disaster phase and strengthened information management and monitoring for further improved preparedness and anticipatory programming. The lesson learned from the cyclone Idai repsonse will be built in the continuation of the CP implementation, including through strengthened preparedness action.          
With the start of the new CP in 2019, UNICEF Malawi embarked on a transformative change management process seeking to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the CO programme in delivering comprehensive, holistic and impactful results for children meeting all children’s needs. The change management process included implementation of the CP based on a lifecycle approach, an application of a new matrix management approach to human resource management and stimulating cross-sectoral collaboration through introduction of design thinking and issue- based task teams for agile problem definition and solution. Lessons learned from the first year of the change management process implementation revealed a more coherent approach to programming, where the complex needs of the child were put at the centre of programme design, thus ensuring a strengthened and integrated delivery of a range of quality services (such as health, nutrition, WASH, child protection and education services) benefiting the single child and her/his family. Implementation of matrix management contributed to strengthened staff capacities, including the acquiring of new, more agile skills (prioritisation, upward and cross-sectional management) and broadening of the technical expertise. Design thinking was actively used in the office to identify innovative approaches to programming. Several agile teams were created and tasked to develop a vision on ECD, Adolescents, Disability, Strengthening Local Governance and Resilience Building and Climate Change. Challenges identified were mostly linked with the acceptance and fast adoption of the change management initiatives with an uneven adoption rate amongst staff members. The CO continuously invested efforts to support staff during the change management journey including through confidential ‘empathy’ sessions.  
In looking forward UNICEF Malawi will strive to incorporate lessons learned into refined programming for delivering strong results to children in Malawi. Focus on innovations will continue to be a priority for the CO to identify user-friendly, accessible and cost-effective ways to address children needs, including through strengthened data collection and monitoring. The CO will continue to improve its preparedness and will invest more efforts to strengthen the humanitarian and development nexus, including through strengthened involvement of communities and building local level partnerships. The CO will boost the engagement and partnership with adolescents and involve them as agents of change and promoters of children’s rights in their communities. UNICEF Malawi will continue to experiment with flexible approaches to organising work processes and delivering CP results in seeking greater coherence and stronger impact of programmes on children’s wellbeing.    
"
ESAR,Namibia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Valuable lessons were learned in 2019, which will inform the implementation of the new Country Programme. The more closely integrated Country Programme and its leaner Matrix Management structure allowed NCO efficient in supporting Government to reach its national goals, an increasingly important aspect of UNICEF programming in Namibia’s UMIC context. Integrated programming was placed at the heart of NCO’s 2019 AWP, and the staffing structure has accordingly been revised to be fit-for-purpose, also with the UN reform as backdrop. The lesson learned so far has been that this new structure enhanced coordination between vertical (sectoral) and horizontal (cross-sectoral) programming to integrate actions within and between outcome areas while strengthening coherence and accountability. Despite some initial resistance to break down silos, this led to staff co-creating lifecycle interventions that effectively address challenges faced by children in Namibia. In addition, staff have started seeing positive impact on their careers, as they are exposed to areas and tasks that had previously not been part of their role. Key challenges, such as a need for strengthened coordination, clarity around decision-making authority as well as roles and responsibilities also to ensure a fair distribution of workload, will continue to be addressed moving forward.
Lack of standard care in health facilities has been identified as one of the key hurdles and investing in quality care during time of labour, childbirth and first week after delivery is one of UNICEF’s top priorities in Namibia. In 2019, UNICEF initiated, in close collaboration with the Health Ministry, site-based, competency-focused coaching and mentoring of midwives. A clear lesson learned was that these skills building workshops conducted in health care settings, focusing on practical skills for essential newborn health, resulted in better skills transferred and post-training implementation than traditional off-site, theoretical trainings. Another lesson learned was that immediate and ongoing follow-up, including remotely via video calling applications, and on-site support drove implementation of learned skills for sustained gains and systems strengthening.
In 2019, UNICEF in close collaboration with key line Ministries, facilitated the scaling-up of co-locating e-birth notification/registration with the registration of some key social protection services at health facilities. The integration is working because it takes advantage of an existing contact point (facility birth) that reaches nearly all women and children in the country. Integrating registration of all social protection services and enabling families to apply for those social services with a single application at the health facility helped to ensure that nearly all families in need can access available social services as soon as their child is born.
The added value of the multi-sectoral approach, which more effectively combined different stakeholders working on child protection to better understand their roles and responsibilities and to strengthen integrated case management, was another important lesson learned. Furthermore, addressing violence from a child protection perspective as well as a barrier to good learning outcomes, increased the response to school-related and community violence.
 In terms of solutions to key programmatic challenges, one successful innovation spearheaded by UNICEF, Government and civil society in 2019 was the roll-out of Community Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) in urban areas. To contain the Hepatitis E outbreak, a strategic shift was taken to include informal urban settlements in programming to end open defecation. Initially, the programme faced administrative difficulties given the informal status of the settlements, but CLTS in urban areas can be successfully implemented and scaled-up, by leveraging UNICEF’s advocacy and expertise.
The full participation of regional stakeholders in the policy formulation process for the National Policies on School Health and EMIS was another key innovation. Centred on principles of social accountability and C4D, such upstream work ensured country ownership of child-friendly policies. The involvement of parents in policy formulation through the School Boards contributed significantly in 2019 to an improved understanding of the crucial role parents and communities play in the education of their children. In this regard, the use of vernacular languages as well as sign language at school board trainings and community engagements proved vital for building a more conducive learning environment for children, especially from the most disadvantaged communities. In a similar vein, involving learners in identifying barriers to education and developing mitigation strategies at school and community levels was a key innovation in fostering child agency. Listening to the voices especially of children with disabilities themselves has been crucial in 2019 for the development of interventions informed by their challenges and needs.
Data Must Speak (DMS) has become the cornerstone of data work in the education sector and beyond in 2019, spanning both decades. Building on DMS, Namibia CO has undertaken an analysis of the existing data landscape for children in Namibia, including the demand for, supply, and uses of data in the country. In conjunction with data landscaping, a new analytical tool developed at HQ, the Administrative Data Maturity Model (ADAM), was developed for the first time in Namibia and will be field tested in 2020. Regional Office and neighbouring countries appear keen to learn from Namibian experiences in streamlining data for children work. 
The UNDP-UNICEF partnership launched the Vehicle-Grid-Integration (VGI) and Electric Vehicle (EV) project. By using these cars and charging them through the solar energy, the agencies will contribute to Greening the Blue efforts and reduce carbon emissions significantly. This pilot project is the first installation of VGI technology in Namibia, and the first at a UN compound in Africa, standing to demonstrate the solution to internal and external stakeholders, with the aim to trigger widespread adoption of EVs across the country.
Based on these lessons learned in 2019, UNICEF and partners will continue to (1) shift towards in-service training modalities that offer both improved effectiveness and higher efficiency with strategic partnerships to strengthen pre-service training of critical cadres; and (2) drive further integration both within UNICEF’s programme and across Government institutions. The Public Finance for Children (PF4C) programme will be a crucial cross-sectoral strategy to ensure child-focused PF4C in Namibia. Increasing the efficiency of in-service training and focusing on pre-service training are other crucial adaptations to the current resource-constrained environment. For example, GRN does not currently finance procurement of life-saving therapeutic foods for treatment of malnutrition. UNICEF has continued to support procurement of these commodities as part of the drought response, but with limited resources that were not sufficient to meet needs. Cost-sharing between UNICEF and Government in the procurement of these commodities, through a revised MoU, is necessary for sustainability and to avoid stock-outs.
The country office will strategically sustain the gains achieved in 2019 in the area of management excellence, Public Finance for Children (PF4C), data for children, violence against children, resource leveraging and mobilization, into our 2020 Annual Management Plans (AMPs). Exploring new avenues such as those under PF4C, including poverty analysis and measurement, strengthening Social Poverty as a tool for reducing inequality and poverty, as well as a sharper focus on co-creating innovations through partnership building, will remain a core orientation for NCO in 2020.
"
ESAR,Republic of Mozambique,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lesson learned  
In line with UNICEF’s evaluation policy, which requires all high-level (L3 and L2) emergencies to be evaluated, UNICEF Headquarters commissioned a Real-Time Evaluation (RTE) of the response in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. 
The RTE found that UNICEF was a critical contributor to government-led responses and one of the humanitarian agencies that mobilized as soon as the impact of the cyclone became evident. UNICEF efforts to rapidly and effectively contain Cholera were remarkable in areas that are Cholera-endemic, as were those affected by the cyclones. UNICEF played a major role at the inter-agency level, through its cluster lead responsibilities, needs assessments and initiatives to prevent PSEA, which benefitted the wider humanitarian community. Success factors of UNICEF response to the cyclones include: (i) good levels of preparedness, including joint-preparedness with government counterparts, and contingency stocks; (ii) UNICEF’s key role in Cholera management resulted in unsolicited offers of funding from donors; (iii) internal organization and quick capacity to mobilize human resources to respond to the emergency. 
The evaluation also sheds light on specific areas that UNICEF should strengthen for future responses. These include ensuring that affected communities actively inform and participate in assistance operations and are not mere passive recipients of assistance. Some of the limitations, gaps and inhibiting factors were: (i) lack of access to conduct needs assessments; (ii) lack of internal mechanisms to promote information sharing, participation and follow up on feedback and complaints; (iii) high turnover of staff and difficulty finding Portuguese-speaking and emergency-experienced staff; and (iv) gender and disability was not systematically considered during assessments and interventions.  
UNICEF partnered with Light for the World to conduct research on barriers for people with disabilities (PwD) to access humanitarian assistance. UNICEF is increasing its focus to children with disabilities and identified this as a key priority in 2020. UNICEF will build on strategic opportunities like the Situational Analysis and the Demographic Health Survey (DHS) to increase evidence about PwD, use the social protection programming for development of tools for PwD identification and will continue to work on inclusive education and disability-friendly WASH initiatives. Communication interventions will target stigma and discrimination. UNICEF will continue to further strengthen the national network of organizations of PwD and periodically engage with them in strategic dialogues. 
Another lesson learned was the relevance that well-prepared staff can have and that strengthening internal capacity for emergencies is the key to future responses. The value of knowledgeable and well-skilled staff cannot be over-emphasized. All UNICEF personnel, regardless of duty stations or level, should familiarize themselves with UNICEF’s mandate as a humanitarian organization and normative frameworks guiding humanitarian action such as the Core Commitments for Children (CCCs). As such, UNICEF is currently considering making the e-learning course on CCCs mandatory to accelerate humanitarian learning.
Innovation:  
When the first cyclone made landfall on 14 March at Beira, government partners were insufficiently prepared for the scale of emergency and struggled with the need to generate and share data efficiently. INGC, the National Disaster Management Institute, and more specifically, the National Centre for Emergency Operations (CENOE), struggled to cope with information demands and was only able to publish a daily situational report of limited detail. The main reason for this was the lack of an appropriate data generation, management and publishing tool.  
UNICEF provided onsite support to develop an information system specifically designed to create data visualizations capable of assisting in real time decision making. After a quick assessment, UNICEF supported INGC in developing a new dashboard, including geo-localization and data visualization. This work resulted in an internal and a publicly available platform by 10 April which quickly became widely used by humanitarian partners involved in the Idai and Kenneth response (site available at: https://cycloneidai.onalabs.org). The site received 1,229 different users and 3853-page views, which averaged approximately 110 visits per day at the peak of the response. By 25 April, when the second Cyclone (Kenneth) struck the northern part of Mozambique, the platform was able to accommodate real time cyclone path information, allowing partners to estimate impact. Less than 72 hours after initial landfall, the GoM was already releasing preliminary impact data and initial resettlement camps were mapped, with information about the number of displaced people.  
For Mozambique, this is an innovative product, a one-stop-shop for data collection, visualization and mapping in emergency. Since its release, over 1,400 visitors have used the site with a total of 3,400 site visits. The internal INGC platformed is scaled to cover all provinces in the country which demonstrates both the value of the tool and its ownership by the GoM. UNICEF learned from the experience and is now in a better position to respond to similar extreme climatic events or other emergency scenarios. It is important to mainstream preparedness in the country programme workplan.  
UNICEF is also leading innovative financing initiatives. UNICEF had a lead role in developing the Joint Fund in support of PRONASAR which received commitments from Switzerland, Austria, UK, USA and UNICEF and includes equity-based targeting, performance-based disbursements, and sectoral prioritization rules (e.g. minimum disbursements for sanitation). UNICEF continued supporting the establishment of an innovative WASH financing mechanism (Small Town Water Fund) to mobilize investment funds for water supply in small towns. The initiative is being coordinated with World Bank, USAID, and the Dutch Embassy. UNICEF is leading on conducting an engineered study for water systems in 35 small towns. The results will be used to refine the financial model and develop the investment package for resource mobilization for the blended fund.
All results were achieved through the generous support of the Governments of Canada, China, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, UK, US as well as the EU, GAVI, CERF and Education Cannot Wait.  UNICEF National Committees of Andorra, Australia, Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, the UK and US generously contributed to the UNICEF Mozambique humanitarian response as well as UNICEF Botswana and UNICEF Philippines country offices. UNICEF had UN joint actions with ILO, IOM, UNFPA, UN-Habitat, WFP, WHO.

ESAR,Rwanda,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Education. UNICEF is partnering with Carnegie Mellon University Africa to further integrate information and communications technology (ICT) in education, utilizing youth talent through Master-level students, to provide innovative solutions in the education sector. Furthermore, UNICEF is supporting the Ministry of Education to build partnership with the private sector to strategically and systematically support the education sector, meeting needs and filling gaps against the Education Sector Strategic Plan.   
Given previous programming’s limited success at ensuring access to quality education for children with disabilities, UNICEF recognized the need to address social norms, particularly around stigma and discrimination at household and community levels. With Humanity and Inclusion, grassroots efforts were initiated on social norms, resulting in many children with disabilities being enrolled in schools. 
In-service teacher training on inclusive education had limited effects. Efforts therefore shifted to pre-service level, where a new course will be introduced for all pre-service students on Inclusive Education and Special Educational Needs from January 2020. 
The previous in-service cascade model to build teacher capacity for competency-based teaching had limited impact on teaching and learning practices. Therefore, UNICEF shifted focus to pre-service training, revising the curriculum and training lecturers at teacher training colleges. UNICEF still supports in-service training through national systems and the school-based mentoring programme, but aims to ensure sustainability and phase out support. The pre-primary education evaluation completed in 2019, along with other key documents, will be utilized to inform a pre-primary diagnostic to be undertaken in 2020.
Modelling of a remedial programme to integrate ICT to enhance teaching and learning processes found that ICT was not significantly embedded into lessons, and ICT applications and tablets had limited usage and scope to affect education quality, therefore upon consultation with stakeholders, the curriculum was revised.  Piloting of ICT integration in the remedial programme will continue in 2021, and a systemic evaluation will monitor remedial programmes’ relative success with and without ICT integration.
Health delivery. In 2019, UNICEF supported implementation of HIV self-testing in antenatal care settings to increase partner testing. Initial findings indicated increased partner testing in Kigali from 75 to over 95 percent. UNICEF will therefore support HIV self-testing for adolescents in 2020. This approach is expected to reduce barriers to accessing HIV testing for adolescents and increase ART coverage among adolescents.
UNICEF continued supporting real-time community health worker (CHW) reporting using RapidSMS. Challenges include lack of community support making the system redundant and less user-friendly; few indicators included, requiring CHWs to report others on paper; individual cases not linked to health facility records; and communities not reached with messages. To address these, UNICEF is supporting migration from RapidSMS to RapidPro, developing interoperability between the electronic medical records system in health facilities and RapidPro, and developing targeted messages for communities.
Despite high immunization coverage nationally, two districts recorded under 80 percent coverage in 2018 (2019 data will be available in early 2020). A study is undergoing to understand why coverage has declined and following its completion, findings will inform interventions to improve coverage, targeting these two districts and others that show declining coverage. UNICEF continued partnering with the East African Community Regional Centre of Excellence for Vaccines, Immunization and Health Supply Chain Management and provided institutional support to strengthen capacity on supply chain management.
WASH. The national sanitation and hygiene promotion programme uses expensive materials and primarily relies on NGOs, effecting short-term changes and then moving on. To address the slow coverage increased during the last few years, UNICEF and the Ministry of Health agreed to model a low-cost, multi-pronged approach of building capacity and empowering district authorities to effectively promote and monitor basic sanitation and hygiene services, improving technical skills in latrine builders and communities, and engaging traders to sell affordable products locally. With UNICEF support, seven districts increased coverage by 18 percentage points after 18 months, achieving a district average of 94 percent coverage of basic sanitation services. Empowering district authorities better reaches ‘everyone’ than short-term partner-led projects and engenders sustainability as district authorities remain responsible over time. Complementarily, locally-available affordable products and services are advantageous for all: households’ access what they require to build better, more comfortable and sustainable latrines, while businesses grow.
To reinforce behaviour at household and community levels, in 2019 UNICEF began piloting a ‘verification’ system to promote local ownership, understanding and sustainability, looking primarily at use and infrastructure once communities indicate universal access. District authorities support verification, which will be further improved and scaled up in 2020. 
Little attention has been paid to including people with disabilities in WASH services. UNICEF has agreed with the Ministry of Infrastructure to develop national guidelines for disability inclusion in WASH in 2020.
Communication. UNICEF produced more multimedia content than in previous years. UNICEF learned that investing in capacity building for local production companies is more effective than bringing international consultants. Unfortunately, UNICEF Rwanda’s Facebook page did not experience expected rates of growth in 2019 but remains one of the 10 most popular in the country. UNICEF will seek alternative strategies to boost engagement on its Facebook page in 2020.
UNICEF held successful activation events surrounding World Children’s Day and the 30th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, but stronger partnership with government counterparts could have led to greater results. In 2020, UNICEF will partner the National Commission for Children on World Children’s Day for stronger advocacy.
UNICEF found that engaging ‘champions’ in ECD investment successfully motivated tea companies which had not yet taken action. These champions – alongside inspiring storytelling and qualitative documentation – advocated with their peers to invest in ECD. Private sector organizations are keen to affiliate with the UNICEF brand to boost their own corporate images.
UNICEF also experienced some delays in project implementation due to delayed decision making from government counterparts and varying levels of understanding among implementing partners. However, working with UNICEF on EVD prevention and preparedness, government and implementing partners demonstrated stronger understanding of C4D, necessity for evidence-based social and behaviour change communication, utilizing more systematic implementation approaches, and regular evidence generation.

ESAR,Somalia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons from implementation, engagement with partners, and from challenges faced in delivering for children in one of the world's most complex environment were manifold, and frequently required innovative thinking. In health, one lesson was that the acute flaccid paralysis and malaria outbreaks showed that cross-border coordination between Somaliland, Puntland and Ethiopia was important. Quick deployment of mobile teams for active case detection, and immediately activating polio mobilizers proved instrumental in ensuring no deaths were recorded. A further innovation was leveraging of the private sector: working with private sector health facilities created synergies for uptake of malaria guidelines and improved the use and impact of drugs channelled through the health system. A further lesson was the multiplier impact of mobile and outreach services, including house-to-house visits and community mobilization. These investments paid off in promoting early health seeking behaviour with an uptick registered in primary health, maternal and neonatal services. One area remains to see progress though, with home births without a skilled attendant remaining the social norm in Somalia, meaning far more awareness, demand creation and innovative approaches will be needed. In Nutrition, a significant achievement, which bore several optimistic lessons about the possibility to run complex surveys in Somalia, was the successful completion of the national micronutrient survey - a first in more than a decade and involving complex data collection. Among the key lessons were the need for strong government oversight and engagement at all stages of survey implementation, including ownership and buy-in from Federal Member State levels, good team selection, efficient training and a centralized and robust data management system that allowed for both routine and real time data quality checks.
Over the year in WASH, a lesson and innovation stems from UNICEF's role in operating and managing nine Regional Supply Hubs and the work done in pre-positioning stocks at government warehouses, which proved a lifeline for partners engaging in rapid responses. Working with the private sector was a further innovation, with the use of Long-term Agreements for water access and delivery services, which positioned UNICEF as a key player in the drought response in recognition of its unique capacity to respond quickly and to scale across the country. Furthermore, in surveying girls’ experiences in schools in an exercise that revealed common challenges, UNICEF embarked on an 'MHM in schools' initiative to support MHM hygiene learning for adolescent girls through Community in Education Committees, female teachers and child-to-child peer support groups. Finally, lessons from working on Public Private Partnerships highlighted the need to concentrate investments on resilient Urban WASH through engaging and helping cities manage more PPP-based water schemes. The 25-year Baidoa Town Master Plan is an example of an ambitious vision articulated around these principles and will require investments that break from the traditional limitations of short-term funding and transition Somalia's water sector for the longer-term.
In education, a review undertaken by the Puntland State Ministry of Education and Higher Education on the efficiency and effectiveness of the individual student scholarship scheme led to a recommendation for a programmatic shift towards an emphasis on systematization of primary school grants. Another lesson learned relates to the design of teacher education programmes, which require a greater proportion of resources for coaching and monitoring. Starting in 2020, UNICEF will be supporting the delivery of a blended teacher training programme, which will use technology as a cost-effective means of reaching unqualified teachers in remote, rural primary schools with a focus on female teachers’ trainees.  Meanwhile in the field of child protection a key innovation was the UPSHIFT programme rolled out under the global banner of the Generation Unlimited initiative. Through UPSHIFT, UNICEF, NGOs and private sector partners provided youth with space to design targeted solutions to solve problems that affect them and their communities. In 2019, the programme reached 300 young people (50 per cent female) from Borama, Burao, Hargeisa, Garowe, and Mogadishu. Empowered to unlock their potential, youth in the programme proposed a range of social innovation projects and learned transferrable skills which together with mentoring they will receive from private sector partners is readying them to soon launch their ideas onto the market. A further innovation was the roll-out of the CPIMS+ Primero case management and data system to Puntland and Somaliland to ensure case management services can reach children along migratory routes, which allowed for a total of 6,109 children (3299 boys and 2810 girls) on the move to have access to protection services (1622 Ethiopians, 416 Djiboutian, 41 Yemenis and 1 Kenyan).
Meanwhile, under efforts for social protection the past year saw significant lessons and innovations which are scheduled to shape the future delivery of UNICEF programmes. First, a clear focus on support to Government has given UNICEF a unique position to be the implementer for building the future social protection payment system of government through the 'BAXNAANO' project. Second, the Joint Programme on Local Governance and Service Delivery innovated in associating children in the shaping of local community development plans - notably in partnership with the Municipality of Hargeisa. In the field of C4D a key new approach was joint community engagement between UNICEF, WFP and FAO with uniform trainings, reporting and supportive supervision under the inter-agency Joint Resilience Action and the KfW supported resilience programmes. Under the emergency programme meanwhile an innovative partnership with African Voices Foundation led to rolling out a voice messaging system and service feedback loops around UNICEF's humanitarian cash programme. A further lesson was the need to emphasize durable approaches and resilience to avoid seeing progress rolled back and undermined by droughts, floods and other shocks. In turn, to improve programme effectiveness and efficiency UNICEF championed new tools and systems, chief among which the United Nations Partnerships Portal, which enhanced UNICEF's ability to drive value for money from its work for children with implementing partners, leveraged together with other key corporate platforms such as eTools. The office meanwhile rolled-out a number of management culture change initiatives in line with global corporate initiatives, with more staff making use of flexible working arrangement, set-up of an Office Improvement Committee which helped develop and run an office-wide management feedback survey, whose key findings were reviewed and will be followed-up on through the coming year. At the same time, an office-wide Protection from Sex
ual Exploitation and Abuse internal reporting system was rolled out, with internal focal points designated and trained in all offices (including Zonal offices). Mobilizing and leveraging resources remained a key priority in 2019, with the office mobilizing 61 per cent of resources needed against the Humanitarian Action for Children appeal, a result below the overall funding level for the 2019 inter-agency Humanitarian Response Plan (which was 82 per cent funded). This highlighted the need to continue strong advocacy with partners to mobilize resources for humanitarian response - in a way also that better links to development and resilience programming, which requires continued and multi-year investment, as the level of development-focused contributions in 2019 also declined compared to 2018.  Research and evaluation were finally among the areas of focus in 2019, with the piloting of a new Gender Study, the conducting of a high-quality rated evaluation on the SIDA-funded WASH programme and the publication of several research pieces over the year, for example in nutrition, as well as in partnership with the Office of Research - Innocenti around children on the move, testifying to UNICEF's role in driving the conversation on data, research and evidence for better programmes and lasting results for every child.
Finally, lessons, challenges and results from 2019 will be put towards the final year of the 2018-2020 UNICEF Country Programme in Somalia. The coming year moreover will be designed not only to deliver on the ambitions set-out in the current plan - the first to be delivered working back from inside Somalia after twenty-five years of remote operations - but also to lay the foundations for UNICEF next Country Programme from 2021 onwards, accompanying Somalia's new and ambitious National Development Plan 2020-2024.. 
"
ESAR,South Africa,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Given the outcome-level changes driven by the output-level achievements, the theory of change underpinning UNICEF South Africa’s country programme still seems highly relevant. Nevertheless, to carry the theory of change forward more effectively and efficiently, UNICEF needs to further build on the useful lessons that were learned or re-confirmed: the importance of (1) securing the highest political commitment; (2) aligning behind the government priorities and (3) considering government’s capacity and timeline for policy making.
UNICEF South Africa once again realized that the commitment and buy-in at the highest political level is instrumental for UNICEF to address the bottlenecks in moving children’s agenda forward. One of the main reasons for UNICEF South Africa’s great progress in ECD and GBV is the fact that those were Presidential priorities. The leadership provided by the Office of the Deputy President and the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation in the implementation of the multi-sectoral NFSNP has helped re-position the issue of nutrition as a national priority. There is now heightened interest in nutrition, right from Parliament to Cabinet, which will provide a more enabling environment for nutrition for children.
What is also re-confirmed is the effectiveness of influencing the government’s priority-setting processes by either providing expertise or playing a convening role as a trusted partner. With a clear vision on what working solutions are available to prevent VAC, UNICEF developed an investment case, detailing how much is needed and how much can be expected as return on investment (ROI) and used it for high-level advocacy for ending VAC. A clear sense of feasibility and ROI expressed in the investment case has inspired the government and multiple partners, and they are adopting those solutions. In addition, UNICEF’s convening role in bringing together internal DBE stakeholders and external partners for ECD was critical in focusing technical and financial resources on common priorities, thereby broadening the reach and quality of evidence-informed interventions for ECD.
What UNICEF South Africa further learned is that there needs to be a full awareness of (1) government’s own policy development calendar and (2) the capacity of departments with whom UNICEF engages to deliver results for children. UNICEF’s attempt to complete the development of National Plan of Action for Children in 2019 did not materialize, because the indicators and targets for the plan could not be determined, due to the delay in the finalization of the government’s medium-term strategic framework, from which those indicators and targets were to be drawn. UNICEF should have considered government’s own calendar before making its own plan. Furthermore, considering the technical complexity of the budget analysis, UNICEF South Africa packaged its recommendations on the budget in an accessible and easy-to-understand format. This led to Parliament readily utilizing such recommendations and adopting them for its own reporting, which attests to the importance of considering the capacity of the partners.
Furthermore, to further operationalize the theory of change, UNICEF South Africa deployed both technology-driven and non-technology driven innovations. One of the most powerful innovations was involving children in UNICEF programming and advocacy, not merely as a beneficiary but also as a co-creator. UNICEF partnered with DSD and civil society organizations in institutionalizing child participation through the child protection week, where 3,500 children discussed issues affecting them with duty-bearers, building on the Children’s Manifesto. The children also had a chance to dialogue with Parliamentary chairs of Budget Portfolio Committees during the event for the 30th anniversary of adoption of the UN Convention of the Rights of Child, CRC@30. UNICEF also heard the voice of youth through U-Report in the development process of United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework and UNICEF Country Programme Document, to ensure that the voice of youth was adequately addressed by UN and UNICEF in South Africa.
In addition to U-Report for youth engagement and participation, UNICEF South Africa deployed the mobile technologies for different thematic areas – MomConnect for Health; ECDmobi for Education; and Child Well-being Tracking Tool for Child Protection (still being developed)– to improve the programme effectiveness and efficiency. To better manage the Technology for Development (T4D) projects, UNICEF South Africa developed the T4D Index, a matrix for strategic alignment and prioritization T4D projects. The Index is now used for initial assessment of the strategic value of a new T4D Project and for the continuous assessment/ determination of the value and “fit for purpose” for T4D projects undertaken by UNICEF South Africa. This index has raised interest both regionally and globally and was showcased in a number of events, including workshops and webinar.
Notwithstanding the achievements, there were challenges as well. A shrinking economy, a growing budget deficit and fiscal prioritization made a few social sectors for children a victim of political prioritization. When coupled with uneven capacity of government and implementing partners, it may significantly militate against the realization of results. Additionally, while lack of quality data is a known impediment to effective programming, some sub-sectors or thematic areas fare much worse. For example, although there is an increase in reporting of SRGBV incidences owing to improved knowledge and attitudes, quality of data collection at the school level remains challenging. In most schools, the reporting system is still paper-based, and thereby some of the data get lost in the system. Finally, there remain significant implementation gaps between progressive policies and actual investments and execution in social sectors.
In 2020, UNICEF South Africa will continue to chart a path of working at national-, provincial- and local-level to address these challenges and advance the child rights and well-being in South Africa. Particularly, the year 2020 will mark the first year of the new country programme for the next five year, which will focus on (1) child health and well-being; (2) early childhood, primary and secondary age education; (3) adolescent development and participation; (4) social and child protection; and (5) social policy and child rights. The new Country Programme will be fully aligned with the government’s Medium-Term Strategic Framework for the National Development Plan 2030 and the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework, which will provide an opportunity to UNICEF to address deep-rooted and emerging challenges. In so doing, UNICEF South Africa will consolidate and leverage the partnerships and platforms built to date to strategically bring child rights and well-being to the center of national policy agenda.
"
ESAR,South Sudan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"A major constraint impacting the delivery of health services, including child health services, was the sudden introduction by MoH of standardized incentives in February 2019, resulting in strikes, low morale and demotivation of health workers. Efforts are ongoing to establish a joint health coordination platform comprised of representatives from the MoH, Health Pooled Fund phase 3 (HPF3), UNICEF and World Bank, which will provide an optimal forum for follow-up discussions with the new transitional Government and partners.
A major achievement is the joint development with HPF3 of a standardized package of essential health services to be provided at Boma, Primary Health Care and Hospital levels, consultatively distilled from MoH’s ambitious Basic Package of Health and Nutrition Services.  This milestone has enabled the delivery of ‘one health programme’ nationwide by implementing partners, supported by HPF3 and UNICEF. This approach has also enabled the nationwide roll out of the Boma Healthcare Initiative as an extension of primary health care delivery rather than as a standalone vertical initiative. 
UNICEF conducted both national and state level bottleneck analysis (BNA) of health service delivery, which proved key for evidence-based planning and programming, for gap identification and prioritization for resource allocation. Innovative training approaches will be used to improve quality of maternal and newborn care in UNICEF supported health facilities.
BNA of low routine immunization coverage validated the main contributors to include limited geographical access, shortage of skilled health force, and challenges of last mile delivery of vaccines and injection devices. Combined catalytic support from Gavi and the World Bank will robustly address these bottlenecks with national and international CSO partners and local authorities. Whilst UNICEF ensured safe vaccine storage through provision of fuel for generators worth US$1.6 million in 2019, solarization of these stores in 2020 will be both cost and climate efficient. In 2020, investment in capacity building for immunization-related health workers will help in reducing high vaccine wastage rates while improving immunization service delivery.
BNA of key nutrition interventions has helped state level actors tailor approaches to address their bottlenecks. Since the initiation of BNA, substantial improvements to service delivery and state level cooperation of nutrition actors were also observed. The evidence-based planning enhanced development of partnership agreements with 40 CSOs for scale up of nutrition services.
Quarterly assessment and star rating of nutrition facilities was a significant innovation in 2019 that motivated nutrition facilities towards continuous quality improvement. A scorecard assessed performance of NGO partners according to cure, death and defaulter rates and prioritized those requiring support. Nutrition facilities were provided with tools, equipment, trained personnel and other aspects of programme quality for better and consistent nutrition service delivery.
Overall progress in humanitarian action was limited by under-funding of critical protective services which resulted in only 55 per cent of targeted children being reached with GBV services. A lack of long-term funding commitments hindered the sustainability and continuity of programmes. For this reason, little progress was made in supporting children’s access to justice systems in 2019. However fundraising activities have been conducted to secure future funds for the child protection programme.
Sustaining funding for the operation of PoC sites including water trucking and sanitation services is very difficult, with UNICEF now effectively playing the role of provider of last resort, which places a severe financial burden on UNICEF’s programming.   The needs in the WASH sector are massive, with many households not receiving any form of humanitarian assistance. Both urban and rural areas are not able to receive WASH supplies services; such as buying treated water and soap.  As such, many communities are forced to revert to using unsafe water sources.
As operational costs continue to rise in South Sudan, UNICEF is revisiting its approach to IRRMs by reducing its dependency on air assets and leveraging access by waterway and road to preposition IRRM supplies. In addition, a partnership with WFP on biometric registration is strengthening data collection, management, follow-up, displacement tracking and harmonized reporting.
Almost 50 per cent of South Sudan’s population are aged 0–17 years. Supporting adolescent development is a global UNICEF priority and a priority of the Annual Management Plan for 2019. However, UNICEF South Sudan needs to do more to support this cohort of young people with life skills, education, employability, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and protection from violence and harmful practices such as child marriage, by further refining the programme strategy to engage with youth.  For example, a Knowledge, Attitude and Practices (KAP) Study on child marriage will be finalized in early 2020, with the findings used to develop a multisectoral ending child marriage programme.
Digitalization of birth notifications has been piloted under the birth registration for maternal, newborn, child health (BR4MNCH) project. During 2019, 73,079 children (49 per cent girls) were reached with birth notification services, with 685,531 children (49 per cent girls) having received birth notification services since 2014.A key lesson is the importance of integrating birth notifications into community-based healthcare and enhancing inter-operability with health systems.
The Community Feedback Mechanism was rolled out, whereby UNICEF community engagement officers in Field Offices conduct monthly household data collection and community engagement. Community feedback on the quality of services will be used for improving programme design. The initiative is partly supported by the UNICEF Data Catalytic Fund through which UNICEF staff will be trained in data collection, quality assurance and analysis.
A state level public financial management (PFM) self-assessment provided an understanding of the current PFM context. Thus far UNICEF has contributed to reviving the MoFP State Budget Workshops for all states to launch budget preparation processes. In addition, trainings were rolled out to identify weaknesses and resource windows in PFM systems, as well as budget execution rates and variance between allocations and expenditure.
As yet, key systems used by cash actors are not able to communicate with each other – for instance, to help prevent duplication or verify eligibility criteria by securely sharing information about beneficiaries. UNICEF, together with partners, will support the Ministry of Gender, Child and Social Welfare (MoGCSW) to organize a Management Information Systems Coordination Workshop inviting key stakeholders with humanitarian databases/biometrics in 2020. A medium-/long-term roadmap will then be developed on the interoperability of parallel databases to support the sustainability and Government ownership of a national social protection information system.
To coincide with the mid-term of the Country Programme in 2020, several key evaluations will be reviewed to reflect the linkages across the various evaluation findings and recommendations, to ensure an integrated approach in identifying key priorities.
"
ESAR,Uganda,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF Uganda is committed to learn to inform programming. In 2019, important lessons were learned about districts systems strengthening in the learning districts. The independent Country Programme Evaluation of the 2016 – 2020 Country Programme further strengthened UNICEF knowledge on what works.
Goal Area 1 
Achieving the shift from support to health systems strengthening (HSS) calls for a different skills-set and a change in programming approaches. UNICEF now has dedicated HSS staff to promote linkages across progammes.
While still in its early stages, the implementation of integrated HSS partnerships at the district level seems to break the one-disease/one-issue approach, reduces transaction costs and supports the HSS shift. Being able to describe, measure and visualize the HSS approach using the WHO conceptual framework on HSS support has helped to promote and increase buy-in from MoH, WHO and other development partners.
Standardization and harmonization of the DHSS approach across the various programmes within UNICEF, between head and zonal offices and across the integrated partners requires a clear strategy supported by communication and programme management tools, which are aligned to the government vision, strategy and operations. These tools and processes require significant time and resources to develop.
The Government of Uganda increased EVD preparedness efforts in 2018, which meant that Uganda was in a position to swiftly respond to the cases reported in 2019.
Investments in C4D research, monitoring and evaluation have demonstrated added value to programmes. Studies and assessments informed programme strategies and implementation including more systematic engagement with stakeholders such as boda boda drivers and traditional healers.
Goal Area 2 
In education, more effort is needed to systematically document and use evidence from pilot initiatives. For example, while digital learning using the Kolibri platform has the potential for going to scale, there is currently no objective evidence to show impact.
Another key learning is that strengthening local government systems is an appropriate strategy for sustainable delivery of education services for children. However, successful system strengthening also requires addressing issues related to broader governance issues, such as recruitment and payment of civil servants.
Although education is the mandate of MoES at the national, district and local levels, issues affecting children require different sectoral agencies working together. District planning officers are key actors to facilitate such coordination.
Goal Area 3
Key to strengthening the protection system is ensuring that all major stakeholders agree to build one consistent, scalable and sustainable system and agree on the key components of the system. This necessitates a culture change within government and among implementing partners away from a project and issue-based approach.
While UN agencies are required to work together to ‘deliver as one’, the process takes time and commitment. Planning timelines need to incorporate sufficient time for the all-important consultation process between agencies. UN joint programmes, including the Spotlight Initiative, have provided opportunities for UN agencies to work together and deliver as one.
After the Child Helpline upgraded its software, with UNICEF support, 20 per cent more callers accessed the service compared to the same period in 2018. As a lesson learned, in addition to conventional support, UNICEF can play a critical role in facilitating innovation by providing technological solutions to build a functioning protection system.
The absence of a simple and fully decentralized birth registration and certification service and  cost of birth certificates are constraints to attainment of legal identity. Advocacy will continue to remove these barriers and to deliver services through the public health infrastructure and district local government.
Goal Area 4
A district-wide approach to ODF with focus on select districts and the intensive collaborative effort with both district political leadership and sector administration has led to greater participation of stakeholders and accelerated results. It is expected that at least one district will achieve district-wide ODF within a year, a notable achievement given the history of slow pace of achievement of ODF in Uganda.
Chronic underfunding of the WASH sector, especially urban sanitation, calls for innovative financing solutions. A sustainable sanitation approach and an associated business model – involving private sector and social impact investing – co-created by UNICEF in Uganda with the Finnish National Committee is a potentially promising new initiative. 
Two innovations were launched in 2019. Solar powered chlorine generators, which produce chlorine from common salt, solar energy and water, were used for EVD preparedness and have shown potential for IPC in HFs, even in normal settings. The other innovation included extending UNICEF-supported school water supply systems to communities and staff accommodation, which strengthened sustainability by increasing community ownership and engagement.
Goal Area 5 
A key lesson learned was that UNICEF success in doubling the funding for traditional vaccines highlighted the need to strengthen and explore partnerships beyond traditional stakeholders.
UNICEF gained significant experience of urban programming through the GirlsEmpoweringGirls social protection programme in Kampala and has adopted a data-driven agile design approach to the roll-out of the programme.
National priorities and plans continue to focus primarily on infrastructure development and economic growth, thereby constraining fiscal space for social sector expenditure. UNICEF will continue to generate evidence and advocate for efficiency gains and increased resource allocations to social sectors. Innovative financing avenues will also be explored, to broaden the space for investments in social sectors and boost policy implementation.
Humanitarian programming
Compared to 2017, UNICEF saw a drop of 10 per cent in humanitarian funding and interest in 2019, impacted by multiple global emergencies, changing global policies and donor fatigue. On the other hand, more donors such as DFID, SIDA, KOICA are interested in development and multi-year funding for refugee-hosting districts, enabling a stronger focus on linking humanitarian and development programming approaches. Development partners in Uganda are increasingly considering options for alternative resource mobilization through public-private partnerships, private sector engagement and joint fundraising between UN agencies. In 2019, WFP and UNICEF received US$50 million to implement a five-year child-sensitive social protection programme in the refugee-hosting districts of West Nile. This programme has a strong focus on HSS, supporting both health, HIV and nutrition services, creating synergies between agencies and highlighting the value add of each.

ESAR,United Rep. of Tanzania,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Investing in the capacities of young people as advocates for change is a powerful strategy to accelerate results for children.
On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the UNCRC, UNICEF brought together young people’s engagement platforms throughout the country using formal and informal partnerships. Over 34,000 young people and children were involved in consultations to discuss their perception of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and develop a Children and Young People’s Agenda for the Tanzania they want for children, with clear recommendations for children themselves and other stakeholders. More than five million children were sensitized on their rights as part of this process.
The children discussed their recommendations and views in six different consultations with groups of UNICEFs key partners and influencers, including editors, business leaders, faith leaders, online influencers, parliamentarians and donors. Each of these resulted in a declaration of commitment by the influencers to support the realization of the Children and Young People’s Agenda. The process culminated in a high-profile event with Government and other stakeholders where young people presented the Children and Young People’s Agenda and discussed the way forward. Led by former President H. E. Ali Hassan Mwinyi, all stakeholders pledged to support the agenda.
This approach has helped to make young people the motor of their own advocacy efforts (using Kiswahili as the main advocacy language), by identifying bottlenecks, highlighting positive examples of change led by young people and identifying solutions they can take forward themselves. The process revealed a potential to further scale up this approach by supporting children and young people with the right knowledge, skills and platforms that will help them to advocate for their own rights. In the long term, this approach might also be able to support positive change and influence social norms and perceptions related to children and adolescents.
Capacities for strengthened accountability for and learning from public policy implementation were enhanced. 
With support from UNICEF, the Tanzania Evaluation Association (TanEA) successfully collaborated with the Parliament of Tanzania and the President Office’s to deliberate on the development of a national evaluation policy, paving the way for a more sustainable means of building national evaluation capacity in Tanzania as well as for strengthened accountability for and learning from public policy implementation.
The governance arrangements of the Tanzania Country Office for managing evaluations were further strengthened to ensure a credible, transparent, impartial and quality evaluation process is in place, in accordance with the 2018 UNICEF Evaluation Policy and United Nations Evaluation Group norms and standards.
Scale up of innovative approaches to prevent school drop-out and to build skills and competencies of vulnerable adolescents who are out of school.
Following the adoption of the National Inclusive Education Strategy in 2018, UNICEF supported the formulation of a skills development curriculum targeting out-of-school adolescents. In addition, a national Integrated Programme on Out-of-School Adolescents (IPOSA), launched in 2019 by the Minister of the President’s Office of the Regional Administration and Local Government, provides literacy, vocational, entrepreneurship and life skills to out-of-school adolescents. In 2019, almost 10,000 out-of-school adolescents (more than half of them girls) aged 14 to 19 years in eight regions were enrolled in the IPOSA programme, significantly increasing the number of children accessing skills development and exceeding the enrolment target of 5,000. As a way forward, the IPOSA programme was expanded from four regions (Mbeya, Iringa, Njombe and Songwe) to Dar es Salaam, Dodoma, Kigoma and Tabora regions.
In addition, UNICEF supported the Government to use innovative approaches and technology to enable the scale up of IPOSA and other similar programmes across all regions in Tanzania and to prevent adolescents from dropping out of secondary school in the first place. Building on progress made in 2018 with the launch of the Generation Unlimited youth challenge, 27 young people received seed funding to implement solutions which address challenges in secondary education, with five of the ideas tested in eight schools benefiting 1,150 students. Working with young innovators in secondary schools presented several challenges, including alignment with school calendars, parental permission and weak structures for administering seed funding to groups of young people. Progressively, a pool of competent partners has been identified who can support future Generation Unlimited youth challenges. Building on this, UNICEF will continue to engage more partners, including from the private sector, to further enable the scale up of ideas to reach more children in and out of schools.
In order to meet the urgent need for expanded education, training and employment opportunities for children and young people (both in and out of school) UNICEF identified and brought together 11 young innovators with creative solutions to enhance classroom learning and to cater for the needs of out of school children across the country. Some of these creative solutions include using artificial intelligence to provide science and mathematics solutions to students, a social venture providing a mobile library with books to remote schools and a volunteer platform for university students and graduates to tutor primary and secondary students. The group of young innovators prioritised content development, teacher training and impact research to build evidence for scaling and to enhance the coordination between the Government, private sector and the donor community. UNICEF will continue to strengthen the partnership with this group of young innovators to inform the design of sustainable and scalable solutions to improve learning outcomes for all children and to further enhance the curriculum with entrepreneurship, self-confidence and problem-solving skills.

ESAR,Zambia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"During the implementation of the Country Programme in 2019, several lessons were learned, some challenges were experienced, and innovative options were applied to mitigate the risks and maximize the attainment of the planned results.
#1: A lesson learned from implementing the 2019 programme, particularly, systems strengthening, was that that results are sustainable when the Government leads and sets aside resources in a timely manner to sub-national level implementing departments. Slow disbursements of national budget funds to social sectors continued into 2019, affecting the pace and scale of programme implementation. In addition to disbursement challenges, the constrained fiscal space due to a slow-down in economic growth and increased debt repayments this year has led to lower investments in the social services sector generally. Delays in releasing funds from the Ministry of Finance led to delayed implementation of activities. The country office will continue with advocacy for the timely release of allocated funds in the national budget, use appropriate funding modalities, including direct payments, and increase assurance activities, notably through the Harmonized Approach to Cash Transfer modality.
#2: With the challenges faced in budget disbursement, there is greater need to review the implementation strategy and sharpen support at district level. Already UNICEF has programmes that support district-wide implementation in several sectors. A lesson learned is that currently UNICEF programme is dispersed and, as agreed in the 2018 MTR, there is need for urgent action for district level convergence for efficiency and programme effectiveness. In the 2020 planning process, a mapping process will be undertaken to further increase programme convergence. In addition, recognizing the current programme management capacities by national institutions at provincial and district level, UNICEF Zambia will increase its presence in select geographical locations for enhanced programme and financial monitoring. In addition, investment will be made on supporting district level functionaries address programme management capacity gaps, including reliable and regular data for programme decisions.
#3: 2019 was the first year of the implementation of the three integrated programming platforms (multi-sectoral nutrition programme to reduce stunting; ECD, and adolescent programming using ECM as an entry point). Several lessons were learned during this first year of implementation. First, internally, while there was agreement in principle of the direction of travel, it quickly was apparent that the what and how to programme needed further discussion. Progress was made in 2019 and programme approach papers for each of the three platforms have been drafted with accountability frameworks proposed for each section. Secondly, externally, while the 7th National Development Plan is grounded in a multi-sectoral approach, it became clear that the current coordination structures were more effective in the reporting phase as compared to the implementation phase of multi-sectoral programmes. UNICEF engaged in high level advocacy for clarity within national partners over roles and accountability to deliver the integrated platforms. This is still work in progress and will be prioritized in 2020.
#4: The Country Programme was designed under the assumption that Zambia was of medium risk for humanitarian situations and that most emergency situations will be short-lived and localized. 2019 has shown that this assumption needs to be revisited with several outbreaks of polio, measles and cholera; a severe drought response that, in all likelihood, will be prolonged; and the increasing demand for UNICEF to support the refugee response (in line with the Global Refugee Compact/CRRF approach). UNICEF was agile and innovative in 2019 and took measures to increase capacities (human resource and financial) to respond to the increased need for responding to humanitarian situations affecting children in Zambia, including through effective use of Regular Resources. The UNICEF approach has been to build on the development-humanitarian nexus and develop capacity of national sector systems to be able to manage and respond to emergencies and withstand shocks. An example is the ongoing drought response where UNICEF Zambia is building the capacity of the district level health system to be able to case-find, refer, treat, and post-treatment follow-up of children with moderate and severe acute malnutrition. Similarly, UNICEF Zambia developed an emergency cash transfer that is using the national SCT data-base and systems – this facilitated a quick start-up of the ECT in the 22 drought affected districts.
#5: In 2019, UNICEF Zambia supported the UN Common System in Zambia  to have a PSEA Advisor whose primary assignment was to, under the direct supervision of the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Zambia, and working in close collaboration with UNHCR, advise and assist the United Nations Country Team (UNCT) to implement the Secretary General “Bulletin on special measures for protection from sexual exploitation and sexual abuse” (ST/SGB/2003/13) with focus on ensuring that protection from SEA is integrated into all services and programmes, including in humanitarian responses as well as the broader long-term development context. The innovative support by UNICEF Zambia facilitated the UNCT to put in place a PSEA response mechanism with accountability towards affected populations, with an emphasis on access to 1) safe and inclusive reporting mechanisms; 2) victim-centred assistance; and 3) legal redress and victim-centred investigation in accordance with the IASC PSEA priority outcomes.
#6: In CO leadership and management, significant progress was made in 2019 in staff development and office culture. The focus was and continues to be on a team who are valued, motivated and fully recognised for their skills and contributions in delivering results for children, and who feel empowered and can “speak up” within a conducive and respectful environment. A UNICEF Zambia Staff Code of Conduct was developed by staff and built around the five UNICEF values of care, respect, integrity, trust and accountability with practical “Do’s and Don’ts”. As one of the 2019 Annual Management priorities, a Leadership and Management Excellence road map and proposed actions were adopted by the UNICEF Country Management Team. UNICEF Zambia was one of the countries cited to have made significant progress in people management excellence and was included in a case study commissioned by UNICEF HQ.

ESAR,Zimbabwe,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The challenges referred in the situation analysis highlight the need to strengthen resilience to sustain the gains made in the social sectors, including investing in strengthening community structures and innovative approaches. This is critical for the office’s theories of change per outcome. The following lessons reflect the office’s experience in 2019, linked to the aforementioned challenges and solutions.
In looking to address MIS data challenges and strengthen data more broadly, including ensuring availability of disaggregated data to support equity approaches, the office has employed a strong approach in the use of technology for development and humanitarian results in 2019. Beginning with the Cyclone Idai response, lessons learnt have highlighted the importance of investing in information management and data preparedness. UNICEF worked with government and NGO partners to identify the standard datasets available, building tools fit for purpose and garnering support among partners to buy into the approach. As a result, humanitarian situation and results data were input into an online data management and visualization platform (ONA), giving near real time information on key results and the status of the situation of women and children in affected areas. UNICEF advocacy also led to the World Bank adopting ONA for monitoring of the Zimbabwe Idai recovery Project. Linking across the humanitarian-development nexus, in 2020 UNICEF will explore whether key elements of sectoral information management systems can be brought together for more disaggregated and wide-ranging situation and results reporting. The use of RapidPro in the WASH and education sectors to gather data for monitoring water service delivery in urban and rural areas and the status of schools and attendance figures is also feeding broader data efforts.
UNICEF gained some valuable learning around resilience building in 2019. In the health sector, the programme focus on system strengthening has been pivotal in building resilience to respond to multiple shocks. This was confirmed during the Cyclone Idai response, when, with available supplies, trained staff and village health workers quickly mobilized to support the response. Further, the economic crisis leading to health worker strikes is being turned into an opportunity through improvement of power supply using solar, innovative motivation mechanisms for staff, broader discussions on health care financing to overcome inefficiencies, and increasing fiscal space. In WASH, a partnership with UNDP on strengthening urban resilience allowed the development of an urban resilience systems analysis leading to a draft national urban resilience roadmap with WASH as a key entry point for local economic development. In the education sector to provide specific support to disadvantaged schools and learners and enhance their resilience, equity- and performance-based criteria were introduced for the 2019 School Improvement Grant programme, with the distribution of textbooks targeted towards disadvantaged schools. Moving forward, UNICEF will further support the Government in capacity-strengthening in disaster risk reduction and management to build resilience against climate change impact.
UNICEF has seen some success and learning emanating from community-based approaches to programming. The nutrition Multisector Community Based Model (MCBM) approach continues to provide a valuable framework for the delivery of optimum nutrition services with enhanced coordination, collaboration, capacity building and community participation. The three MCBM pillars - a single coordination structure, a harmonized nutrition package and a near real time monitoring system - were assessed in 2019. The findings show that the structures are critical for delivery of services and need to all be brought to a high level of functionality with improved reporting, knowledge management and capacity strengthening. Next steps include providing systems and guidelines to sub-national levels and creation of an enabling policy environment. In the WASH sector, there is also a focus on communities, especially in rural, more marginalized areas. A key lesson in 2019 was that there is a continued need to strengthen the community management arrangements that will sustain the infrastructure. An opportunity exists for WASH to build on the Community Health Clubs, which consistently yield strong hygiene results and more sustained outcomes. The Community Adolescent Treatment Supporters (CATS) as a peer community cadre to disseminate information on sexual and reproductive health, HIV and mental health at community level and link to treatment and care, have proven effective in 2019 and represent an important opportunity to reach vulnerable adolescents and young people. UNICEF will look for avenues to scale up this approach in 2020.
UNICEF has done significant work in policy advocacy in 2019. The Education Amendment Bill provides for free basic education and creates scope for innovative and sustainable school financing models. Close engagement with the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Education provided opportunities to advocate on this key agenda. UNICEF also supported the development of the Early Learning policy and the Inclusive Education Policy. The collaborative work of the education stakeholders (government, communities, UNICEF and CSOs) was critical in the successful development and promoted ownership. In the development of the aforementioned Disability Policy, UNICEF was able to leverage its global knowledge and partnerships including with other UN Agencies to inform the policy development. Through the UN Resident Coordinator's Office, UNICEF drew together UN Agencies in Zimbabwe to have a common voice, in ways that effectively reconciled the different perspectives of key government actors. Finally, UNICEF, with the Ministry of Finance, was able to influence the government to avail co-financing for all New Vaccines to Gavi for 2019 using available evidence to influence the decision.
UNICEF has had some strong experience in youth engagement in 2019. The first ever nutrition hackathon coding event - engaging 55 young people aged 10-24 years from all over Zimbabwe where participants developed ICT-based prototypes addressing nutrition challenges in partnership with BOOST Fellowship – demonstrates the opportunity to engage young people in co-creation of solutions. UNICEF also engaged young people in the CRC@30 celebrations, supporting youth to champion the causes of children and women in Zimbabwe. In 2020, UNICEF will build on the experiences and potential to explore more systematic ways of partnering with Junior Parliament, Junior Government and Junior Mayors and engaging them in their communities.
"
LACR,Argentina,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The most important lesson from 2019 was UNICEF’s unique position and capacity to turn a high economical restriction and political changes context into great opportunities for visibility of children and adolescents’ rights. On one hand by taking advantage of the focus of the public debate during general elections on the economic crisis and debt (Argentina’s greatest concern during the year), to highlight the necessity of focused public investments to pay the biggest debt Argentina has: with its children and adolescents, letting more than 30% of them live in poverty during the last 30 years and reaching a 55% level by the end of 2019. On the other hand, by making an extraordinary effort to strengthen the commitment of donors and allies to the cause of children, calling them to joint our conviction that, despite the difficult economic situation, it's exactly in times of crisis, when children and adolescents need us the most.
A good example was the way we turned well-established-fundraising-events into a whole-of-UNICEF efforts for multiple engagement (social mobilization, advocacy and strategic partnership) well exemplified by the 2019 version of the ""Un Sol para los Chicos"" campaign. In terms of fundraising, the event achieved a new record in local currency. In terms of social mobilization and advocacy, during the 10-hour telethon, UNICEF broadcasted 11 programmatic spots related with Argentina’s country program priorities and emergencies listed in the 2019 HAC. In terms of public advocacy, ""Un Sol para los Chicos” was linked to the contents developed during the parenting month and to the two stages of the electoral campaign. In terms of strategic partnerships beyond Argentina, the event was a unique opportunity to present the local chapter of the regional alliance with Kimberly Clark for ECD, and to receive colleagues from other UNICEF Country offices to inspire the implementation of successful telethon events in their countries. In terms of reach, apart from the 5 million TV and the 6.4million digital viewers, the messages related to #UnSol2019 potentially reached more than 1 billion accounts, achieving more than 19,500 mentions (with positive comments 5 times higher than negative ones) and generating 245,000 engagements. This was made possible thanks to the participation of more than 150 celebrities and opinion leaders, as well as the contribution of influencers (including young people).  Another good example is the work ACO did with the private sector applying the new B4R approach -whole spectrum funds, core assets, advocacy, CRB- which boosted engagement, UNICEF's supporters, fundraising results and concrete results for children as those obtained related with family friendly policies for Early Childhood Development.
All these efforts allowed us to overachieve fund raising targets in local currency and, through this, to give continuity to the cooperation program in Argentina as well as to contribute to guarantee the rights of children around the world.
At the same time, the implementation of the regular program has had different lessons learned. First, in order to address the most disadvantaged children and adolescents with quality and accurate education services, it proved worth developing innovative models - TECH-Rural Secondary School initiative and PlaNEA- and building public-private alliances to scale these models up (such as the incipient GenU platform). Second, developing information tools -as the RUN- with a comprehensive approach and based on technology allowed to improve the intersectoral response to children’s rights violations. Third, in order to manage sensible topics e.g. suicide, early pregnancy and obesity, a combination of strategies such as building a regulatory framework, raising social awareness, improving services and guaranteeing adolescents participation seems to be essential to obtain pertinent results for adolescents.
In 2019, we engaged in meaningful and novel ways to operationalize the UN reform at country level. On one hand, participating in the Spotlight initiative, not being a fund Recipient UN Agency, challenged the traditional approaches and procedures and has strengthening result-focused interagency work. On the other hand, receiving the grant to develop the SDG Joint Program on social protection -UNICEF as lead agency- has shown UNAFP the possibility to comprehensively affect systems that determine children’s live e.g. 0 to 6 years boys and girls from the most vulnerable contexts by promoting: Provincial Early Childhood Strategies; innovative instruments using new technologies and big data to improve provincial public management and finances; and a strategy to improve the working conditions and the professionalization of the childhood care workers. Finally, the knowledge and experience UNICEF has developed regarding children on the move, has allow us to make strategic contributions to the emerging refugees and migrants response plan, led by UNHCR and IOM.
Finally, all of the year’s achievements could happen despite the complex external and internal environment, thanks to the efforts ACO has made to effectively manage the office. Argentina CO staffing structure has grown from 70 posts in the beginning of the country programme (2016) to 110 posts in October 2019. At the beginning of the year an Office demographic analysis shown that 75% UNICEF’s staff members had worked in the organization less than 3 years, putting as key goal to get all of the staff (old and new) to embrace UNICEF's culture and to work harmoniously as One UNICEF.
Establishing open channels to hear staff needs and concerns, keeping an honest and respectful relationship between management and the staff and a healthy and close collaboration with the local staff association (APUBA) proved a very useful strategy to apply the speak up culture principles, prevent abuse and harassment, and react timely and appropriately if any of these issues arise. At the same time, it allowed to identify alternatives to keep staff well-being possible in a very challenging year. According to the September 2019 Argentina's staff association regular survey, 60 out of 68 survey respondents found that actions were taken by management to address staff survey findings.
At the same time, office performance monitoring, financial oversight, and proper risk management were key to maximize results. The 254 contracts issued ensured the best value for money with transparent and robust procurement processes. HACT assurance activities were satisfactorily achieved, (Q4 0% Direct Cash Transfers (DCTs) outstanding over nine months). An internal audit and an external ICT/Cybersecurity audit were carried out successfully. Furthermore, a strategic business-partner model - among UN-AFP operation sections- was promoted to mitigate the intrinsic risks of high inflation and currency devaluation that negatively affect financial resources and vendor contractual relations.
Looking ahead, focusing our cooperation on effectively protecting children, adolescents and families from the adverse consequences of the financial crisis is the main objective of 2020. At the same time, special effort will be required to define ACO next five-year priorities by reviewing the changes in the outside and inside context. To do so, it is crucial to build trust and create a fluid and fruitful relationship with new authorities at both national and provincial level, while nurturing the support and engagement of our allies and donors, in a cooperative UN framework.
"
LACR,Barbados,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The year 2019 was characterized by challenges and lessons learned, presenting opportunities from which UNICEF ECA will shape future programme implementation over the next two years.
Since the ratification of the CRC by the ECA countries and territories, the reporting process has inspired and drawn political attention to children’s rights. To support countries to domesticate the CRC principles and provisions to enhance the protective environment for children, UNICEF and partners supported the development of model laws and policies for the region. Nevertheless, over the years, ECA countries and territories had been generally slow in revising existing laws and regulations to include legal guarantees of and responsibilities for responding to violations of children’s rights.
In 2019, the longstanding commitment to law and policy reform by UNICEF, OECS Commission, UN and other development partners, resulted in successes for the family and child protection reform agenda. With UNICEF support, Antigua and Barbuda raised the minimum age of marriage from 15 years with parental consent to a minimum age of 18 years without parental consent, instead of 16 years contemplated by Government. Anguilla adopted the OECS model legislation on Child Protection; the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines’ Parliament passed the 2019 Child Justice Act, and Barbados’ Cabinet approved its 2019 Child Justice Bill. Policy-wise, UNICEF’s advocacy and technical support also resulted in approval of the Government of Trinidad and Tobago’s Child Policy and Child Protection Implementation Plan as well as the Government of Saint Lucia’s suspension of the use of corporal punishment in schools, and the public pledge to abolish the practice of corporal punishment in school settings within the short term, by the Minister of Education in Barbados. The key lesson learned is that UNICEF’s strategic engagement on child rights legislative and policy change is long-term and incremental in the Eastern Caribbean and should be continuously planned and sustained over time.
UNICEF ECA’s South-South Cooperation on Care for Child Development (CCD) involving the UNICEF offices in Belize and Haiti, the CARICOM Secretariat, OECS and the Governments of Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, British Virgin Islands, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Turks and Caicos Islands provided a valuable learning experience for the early childhood team from the Caribbean Region. The CCD methodology is designed to support families in promoting the positive development of young children through health, early childhood and education services and provided through the relevant sector and community providers. This South-South Study mission or “horizontal cooperation” was implemented in February 2019 and was designed to share knowledge and good practices and demonstrate the critical value of providing programmes which emphasizes nurturing care for young children during the first 1,000 days in life. This period has been scientifically established as critical for the overall health and development of a child. The horizontal exchange presented an opportunity for Government ECD Officers to strengthen their knowledge and skills to be more effective in enabling young children to develop resilience to cope in difficult situations, to improve their developmental outcomes and to benefit from the exposure to Belize’s model of fully integrated ECD. The interactive sessions included Technical Seminars and Clinical Practice sessions in Health Clinics, Community Centres and homes in Toledo, District. The demonstration of strong leadership and intersectoral collaboration in the systematic implementation of the CCD methodology in various community settings in Belize was effective in highlighting the potential for replication and adaption in the Eastern Caribbean. The training in the CCD methodology was implemented in Trinidad and Tobago, Antigua and Barbuda and British Virgin Islands in 2019.
In 2019, UNICEF ECA expanded the use of innovative tools and approaches for data generation to achieve results for children and young people. In collaboration with OECS Commission and Innovation Team (HQ), the Project Connect “Mapping Schools to improve Connectivity and Learning Environment in the Eastern Caribbean” was launched in November 2019. The initiative aims to map all schools in the OECS member states and their level of access to facilities and connectivity in real-time, to identify gaps, measure vulnerabilities and risks and optimize service delivery and emergency preparedness.
This initiative is innovative because it uses a combination of traditional and new data collection sources and tools, such as machine learning technology to capture geographic position of schools, followed by data verification using GPS devises, and admin data providing information on school facilities and attributes. For the first time the Eastern Caribbean countries will have digital maps visually reflecting the SDG indicator 4.a.1 on school facilities, which will provide participating partners with the information to harness public-private and trans-national partnership for investments in education. Approximately 184,700 children and adolescents attending 1,147 schools in the 9 OECS members states are expected to benefit from this initiative.
Project Connect on School Mapping in the Eastern Caribbean aligns with UNICEF’s innovation principles and priorities for children and is part of the global UNICEF-ITU GIGA “GAVI for Gigabytes” initiative to connect every school to the internet, and in this way – every young person to information, opportunities and choice. The innovation has the potential to expand in breadth to include other Eastern Caribbean countries and in depth to map additional public infrastructures (health facilities, sports centres) relevant for children and young people.
Gains in 2019 also illustrated that work on real-time data and innovation is critical and should be strengthened to enable expansion. The mobile phone-based application ‘U-Report’ has enabled UNICEF programmes to engage with young people in Trinidad and Tobago and leverage information and communication technologies. UNICEF ECA has not yet fully embraced the innovation platform potential, which will require ensuring sufficient support the scalability and sustainability potential. In 2020, UNICEF ECA plans to establish partnerships that would use U-Report to increase VAC case reporting and psychosocial support and provide cost efficient and targeted solutions to improve response and quality of child protection services and address bottlenecks in reporting of cases of violence in both development and humanitarian contexts.
"
LACR,Belize,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"With the growing scope of the programme (additional output on AH; expansion of the violence prevention progrmame with 3-year Spotlight grant; strengthening of Nutrition programming with thematic funding; CPD ceiling raised in USD 1 million; growing imperative for action on migration; relevance of emergency/climate change and development nexus in a country prone to hurricanes and floodings; and growing UN joint programming) there is a need to further strengthen intersectoral work and prioritization of main expected results, adapting to updated situation analysis especially of the most vulnerable children. The 2019 CO SMR around the Mid Term of the CPD, the upcoming launch of the SITAN, expected submission of Belize State report to the CRC, and 2020 Belize VNR on the SDGs, provide important opportunities to inform the programmatic priorities of the last two years of the current CPD, and to transition and start developing -in 2020- the new CPD for 2022 onwards.
As the single largest source of statistically representative survey data on human develpment and social policy issues in Belize, MICS is an important source of evidence base to support reporting on national development policies. In the absence of regular national household surveys, UNICEF’s support to the continued implementation of MICS is critical to the achievements of results for children in Belize.
The long-term objective of the Sustainable Child Friendly Municipalities Initiative (SCFMI) is to ensure sustainable results for children and a commitment to advancing child rights at the local level. As such, the Initiative is inextricably linked to the pursuit and achievement of the SDGs. The SCFMI approach supports local governments in implementing the 2030 Global Agenda through inclusive processes, holistically addressing issues related to the well-being of families and the youngest citizens. The SCFM experience in Belize indicates that success in SDG achievement will depend strongly on responsive policy translation at local level, requisite resources and clear, tangible engagement spaces with stakeholders who are especially capable of localizing the SDGs as part of program planning. 
The issue of violence is complex and multifaceted. Therefore, the approaches to violence prevention should be pertinent to the national context, comprehensive and sustainable. Relationship-building at community level is integral to success. However, it remains evident that stronger emphasis needs to be placed on addressing trauma at household and community level and support is needed to improve responsiveness in the Child Protection System. The Child Protection Technical Working Group (CPTWG), a multi-agency group providing technical guidance and advocacy for child protection, is a functioning group with a 5-year strategy. While the working group reconfigured itself to be able to adequately respond to the challenges of the Child Protection System, major child protection gaps remain in the system. Questions around leadership and decision-making made it difficult to advance some key changes within the child protection system for the last few years, and work was only taking place around available funds, rather than on addressing key service delivery gaps. To this end, a major lesson learnt for the working group is the growing need to enhance and strengthen coordination and multisectoral response to issues affecting children nationally. As a result, together with UNICEF, the National Committee for Families and Children worked with the committee to identify key gaps and priorities needed and established a plan of action to address these issues. The major lessons remain buy-in across all sectors and the importance of setting priorities collectively and not solely around available funding.
Investment in advocacy, public awareness, and Communication for Development (C4D) based on evidence greatly impact results and resource mobilization.  UNICEF Belize has built on evidence generated from research such as the MICS, for different sectors, and advocacy in AH and ECD has contributed to greater investment by the Government of Belize. Evidence generation, coupled with opportunities for South-South collaboration, contributed to Belize showcasing best practices in the Caribbean. This has been the case for CCD and effective programming in emergency preparedness and Disaster Risk Reduction as well as for AH through multiple presentations at the First Caribbean Congress on AH in 2019.
Positive parenting is highlighted as key in the development of children and adolescents, and in Belize, multi-sectoral approaches to programming have proved successful. This is particularly in the case of the integration of the Violence Against Children Technical Seminar in the implementation of Care for Child Development (CCD). CCD remains a strong platform for supporting the prevention of abuse, malnutrition and nurturing care and is a key home-based intervention promoted by the Violence Against Children Regional Strategy document.
The important work that UNICEF Belize has supported on emergency preparedness and Disaster Risk Reduction over the past two years has shown that success is dependent on the key cross-sectoral component to all development outcomes for children and adolescents. This also impacts supply management and logistics. With increased emergencies in the region, the National and Regional Protocols for the Integrated Protection of Children and Adolescents in Disaster Situations for the Caribbean (2019) have the opportunity to support strengthened actions for the protection of children and adolescents. There was strong collaboration and coordination among LACRO, CDEMA and 18 participating states in the Caribbean, which ensured the success of a quality document, resulting from successful consultations and peer review. Well managed resources were optimized and mobilized where required.
The CO SMR in early 2019 and the SMR with other Caribbean MSDF countries in late 2019 informed modest changes to the structure and strategic adjustments for consideration to ensure more effective delivery and of results as well as positioning in light of emerging issues.
Key recruitments were finalized and multiple long-term consultants continued to support important aspects of programme delivery enabling expansion and influence of the SP work, development of critical policy frameworks on AH as well as evidence generation on the neglected area of mental health.
L&D and LSA collaborated to organize a thematic session for the entire team at the end of the year which helped serve dual objectives of team building and team learning. The experience was extremely positive and cost-effective. The approach is well worth adopting for optimization of limited L&D funds.
"
LACR,Bolivia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Within the context of general elections,  an atmosphere of increasing political polarization in Bolivia, and unexpected emergency situations, UNICEF Programme priorities during 2019 focused on positioning children and adolescent rights on the public and private agenda; consolidating the implementation of  IECD models in prioritized municipalities (for policy development and future scale-up); positioning the adolescence and youth agenda with a gender focus in public debates and political spaces; defining and implementing holistic and intersectoral models to prevent and respond to violence against girls, boys and adolescents; and strengthening national and subnational capacities to respond to emergencies and the impact of climate change on children.
In 2019, the Country Office advanced in the design, rollout and implementation of IECD models in El Alto and Independencia municipalities, achieving recognition as having the required local understanding and technical expertise for this area. Progress in the implementation of the model was sustained despite the change in authorities and the social conflict that occurred after the October elections. The lessons learned with regard to this experience is that achievements are a result of multiple interventions: 1. Investing significant resources to define key problems and solutions; 2. Gaining government and partners’ commitment to actively participate in all stages of model definition and implementation; 3. Elaborating guides, protocols and tools; 4. Building technical and operational capacity of front line workers; and 5. Establishing a monitoring plan with a clear baseline. The Country Office must learn from this experience to later utilize this effective strategy to develop other innovative models to advance sustainable results and model scale-up in other programmatic areas.
UNICEF Bolivia demonstrated its ability to plan and implement required rapid and appropriate responses considering the fluctuating national contexts, including landslides in La Paz, wildfires in Chiquitanía and the post-electoral social conflict. Working with both governmental counterparts and non-governmental organizations in a coordinated manner, provided the foundation for continuing interventions regardless of the emergency situations and social unrest. This also allowed to accelerate programme implementation while strengthening the capacities of government and civil society organizations. The main lesson learned here was that within this national context, critical steps are required to widen UNICEF’s partnerships while implementing multi-level modalities to respond to emerging ‘turns of events’; take advantage of ‘windows of opportunity’; and sustain an effective capacity to deliver results for children, women and families.
The Country Office recognizes the importance of scaling up work for Venezuelan migrant children, a population that has increased considerably during 2019, requiring immediate social protection actions. The primary response activities included assessing the situation of these children and their families, advocacy with national authorities for the activation of immediate response strategies, and providing psychosocial support and legal assistance to migrant children and their caregivers in La Paz. The geographic coverage of this assistance will be extended to Cochabamba, Santa Cruz and Guayanaamerín (on the border with Brazil) in preparation for what is likely to become a growing emergency during early 2020. For this reason, the Country Office is required to build internal and external capacity, learn from other regional experiences working with Venezuelan migrants, mobilize human/technical resources and funds, and work closely with national and subnational Bolivian authorities and bordering countries in collaboration with other UNICEF Country Offices and UN agencies.
The limited inter-institutional and multi-level government coordination has been and can be a bottleneck to advance the fulfillment of child and adolescent rights. During 2019, UNICEF Bolivia explored additional entry points and spaces for work by approaching the municipal associative system. This system includes the Federation of Municipal Associations of Bolivia, the Association of Councilors of Bolivia, and the Association of Capital Municipalities of Bolivia. These institutions have demonstrated their value as allies for capacity building and advocacy processes, focusing on the development of integrated public policies and budgets at the local level. For example, the organization of budget workshops on aligning investments with children's rights, developed with the Ministry of Economy, are in greater demand because of the new alliance with the Bolivian Municipal Association System.
UNICEF Bolivia is very enthusiastic about this year’s innovations and results achieved. Baselines were developed to inform programmatic efforts, legislative frameworks strengthened, and new partnerships established. Also, innovative mechanisms are now in place to provide a collective ‘vehicle’ to hear children and adolescents' voices and to promote their active participation in political and decision-making platforms. Likewise, important advances have been made to strengthen gender cross-cutting strategies throughout multiple outcome areas. Moreover, the lessons learned will contribute to refining and/or updating programme management strategies; better preparation for upcoming socio-political changes; consolidation of 2019 results achieved; and improving UNICEF’s capacity to document, sustain and scale-up successful innovative approaches and models.
With the change of government authorities in 2020, the Country Office will need to invest in efforts to reestablish and strengthen the necessary platforms, partnerships and institutional engagements at the national and sub-national levels. UNICEF will also need to start a new exercise with elected authorities to identify the existing and potential bottlenecks that may hinder current efforts to reduce inequalities, exclusion and discrimination against children and adolescents. This action is required to ensure counterparts are both involved in and fully understand the Theory of Change that will inform and provide inputs for annual work plans and help identify desired results.  The Country Programme Mid-Term Review, scheduled for the second half of 2020, will be a very timely and pertinent platform to make adjustments to the Country Programme for the years to come.

LACR,Brazil,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The campaign for the 30th anniversary of the CRC was testament to the fact that despite a challenging human rights landscape, the overall willingness to engage for children’s rights remains high among partners and the broad public. The high interaction with the mobilization campaign “And you, what will you do?” with almost half of those reached also engaging with the messaging – triggered also by the involvement of key influencers - demonstrated broad interest and commitment to children’s issues. The CRC publication that highlights both the country’s outstanding achievements and the severe shortfalls such as the extremely high homicide rates among adolescents, also reaffirmed the importance and power of evidence-based balanced analyses.
The UNICEF public positioning on sensitive topics - timely, impartial and substantial - produced positive results by strengthening UNICEF standing with stakeholders. In the aftermath of the death of nine adolescents and youths due to police action in the favela of Paraisópolis in Sao Paulo, the clear statement placed UNICEF in the position to work with partners for appropriate responses from the government.
Armed violence remains a major challenge in Brazil and in the Latin America and Caribbean region as a whole. In this regard the launch of the joint Child Protection and Education strategy “Educação é Proteção contra a violência” to address the issue of child protection within, near and related to the school, was a key milestone. Looking forward, more operational efforts are required to enhance programme convergence across education, child protection and adolescent interventions to create safe and protective environment for children and adolescents living in communities affected by armed violence.
The role of partnerships with the private sector for financial and non-financial resources and innovation is critical to advance child rights. For instance, co-creation and exchanges of practices with private sector partners has unveiled a great potential to foster innovative approaches to boost the active search of out-of-school children. It is also clear that business partners are open to engage their consumers and networking if we can provide simple, easy to understand advocacy messages and ways of communicating. At the same time, if we want to take on closer partnership with the private sector, UNICEF will need to review its planning dynamics to allow more flexibility for co-creation with the participation of business allies. More flexibility is also required on the operational and legal requirements that increasingly represent obstacles to broader alliances.
In 2019, ICT unit contributed with technology for development (T4D) to the School Active Search and Successful School Pathway strategies providing internal/in-house hiring of software developers. This change from the previous outsourced services brought an estimated cost avoidance/saving for the last 13 months in the amount of US$ 235,000 as well as productivity increase of 43 per cent. This important contribution illustrates the importance to use T4D to untap other similar opportunities.
The continued migration flows in Brazil’s northern region and the relocation of vulnerable migrants to other states, points to the need to ensure continuity of existing humanitarian interventions in Roraima, while expanding coverage to Manaus and Belem. This will require new partnerships with local NGOs, while simultaneously building on UNICEF’s exiting programming partnerships with over 800 municipal and state authorities in Brazil’s North Region. UNICEF will therefore invest in synergy and alignment of its humanitarian and programme interventions in the Amazon territory to better link municipal engagement on child rights with the migration and climate change agendas. Adolescent engagement can play a key role in this regard: for example, the use of design thinking (Upshift) approaches with Brazilian and Venezuelan adolescents produced excellent results to define solutions for issues related to access to public services, xenophobia, and integrative initiatives to face discrimination.
From an internal perspective, the Strategic Moment of Reflection, that the office undertook in 2019, was key to review programme results and strategies implemented in the first half of the Country Programme in order to align them to the evolving political context while simplifying the programme structure. As a result of the review, results were sharpened focusing on thematic priorities in health, education, child protection and adolescent empowerment and well-being, supported by a revised public and policy advocacy strategy. The coordination of the two municipal strategies to deliver country programme results (UNICEF Selo for small vulnerable municipalities across 18 states and the Urban Platform engaging 10 cities) was simplified, with one coordination mechanisms at Brasilia level. The territorial structure was finetuned to ensure a coherent and strategic approach in the Rio, São Paulo and Vitoria territory.
Managerial accountabilities were clarified at output level, with the annual management plan emphasizing the role of thematic working groups to ensure coordination and implementation across Brazil’s nine field offices. Joint work planning was also strengthened to articulate country level annual targets across the three territories and ensure engagement of field teams in the preparation of thematic work plans. As the internal audit confirmed, these adjustments have proven to be an important step towards strengthening coordination and alignment of thematic strategies at sub-national levels and will need to be further sustained and deepened in 2020 and beyond.
This year also reaffirmed the importance to continue to invest in staff wellbeing and working conditions. Only in 2019, four of the ten offices moved to safer and better premises and three were substantially refurbished providing better work conditions. On the other hand, Recife and Brasilia need relocation or restructuring as poor conditions are affecting staff morale. The active promotion of stretch assignments was well received for career development but raised concerns in terms of workload for colleagues requiring a more balanced strategy. The continued participatory reflection of the Independent Task Force report using focus group will be key to identify further actions to continue to improve the overall climate as well as safe and respectful work environment.
"
LACR,Chile,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"During the protests and social unrest the country’s independent monitoring mechanisms, the Children’s Ombudsperson’s Office and INDH, played critical roles in monitoring the situation and advocating against human rights violations. UNICEF Chile maintained close coordination with both institutions during this period, and particularly with the Children’s Ombudsperson’s Office, thanks to a trusting relationship built over the last 18 months.
While support for the Children’s Ombudsperson’s Office and its role played during the social unrest cannot be attributed only to UNICEF’s work, UNICEF has collaborated with the Ombudsperson’s Office since its establishment, facilitating several high-level bilateral meetings with UNICEF’s Representative. UNICEF has contributed in strengthening some of the Ombudsperson’s Office’s key areas. It has also supported their communication team in building credibility through mass media and increasing visibility, providing technical assistance in child protection issues, and accompanying them at UNICEF events.   
As a result, this new institution is empowered to effectively and efficiently play its role during this critical time for children and adolescents in the country.  
The increase of UNICEF’s presence in mass media and the public accessing UNICEF Chile’s website has been shown to be directly linked to how ongoing national events were impacting children’s rights, such as the violent clashes between students and the police at the National Institute, and during the social unrest, students protests and the draft bill discussed in Congress for the preventive identity control on persons under 18. In 2019, UNICEF made more public statements than it has in previous years, urging the Government and society to respect the CRC for the fulfillment of children’s rights. As a consequence, UNICEF’s website experienced a major increase in visitors as public interest has grown in the issues raised by UNICEF in statements on Facebook and Twitter. 
Another important lesson learned since the onset of the social unrest is the need to have a workplan that keeps in mind the long-term priorities of the Country Programme Document, and at the same time has flexibility to respond to contingencies. Quick reactions have been required such as sharing guidelines to support teachers and families with children during the instability, and compiling methodologies to promote children’s participation in dialogues. 
Due to the changes in the Government agenda over the last few months, UNICEF is adjusting its priorities to respond to the emerging demands and requests, and providing support for the new Social Agenda and the process of the new Constitution. Opportunities were opened up by the social unrest for UNICEF to reinforce its advocacy with authorities and key social actors to reduce inequity: such as by linking the Government’s new Social Agenda with UNICEF’s continuous promotion to consolidate a Comprehensive Child Protection System; and by strengthening the social protection system for the most vulnerable children and families. Cultivating and diversifying working counterparts will also be necessary, as the context continues to change rapidly. 
The unforeseen situation of the social unrest also brought lessons-learned for in-country fundraising, the main lesson being that social stability is crucial for the successful operation of private sector fundraising strategies. The importance of flexibility and adopting the strategies during the contingencies was also learned. At the onset of the social unrest, UNICEF’s planned operation was temporarily halted and the focus shifted to UNICEF showing support for active donors, which resulted in unexpected positive responses and appreciation.
With the rapid growth of the PFP team, an important lesson was learned about the challenges. As per the nature of the PFP area, it is quite usual that personnel hired have no previous working experience with the UN, or even in fundraising itself. This requires the investment of a considerable amount of time and effort of the team manager and operations staff to build the team, carefully integrating both old and new members. While this brings an important learning curve to the team and the office, this additional workload needs to be well considered in developing future workplans.
UNICEF has continued to advocate and contribute to the deinstitutionalization of children. UNICEF supported an innovative South-South Cooperation with the governments of Chile and Uruguay and field visits of technical experts to each country drew important conclusions for both governments. It is critical to integrate actors from different public sectors of social policies and identify their roles and responsibilities for the deinstitutionalization of children, as the implementation of integrated social policies is indispensable in supporting families to avoid separation, and in providing support for family reunification. Participants from both governments considered it strategic to pre-define specific topics to have a clear and workable agenda for the South-South Cooperation plan and focus the work ahead on two main challenges: preventing institutionalization and reunifying institutionalized children with families.
 
 
 
 
"
LACR,Colombia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"a) Innovations
UNICEF partnered with Millicom-Tigo (mobile/internet provider) to co-create an initiative on online child protection entitled “school of influencers.” The strategy engaged children between 10 and 19 for developing skills geared on safe, responsible and creative internet use. By forming a peer-to-peer network -- “ciberconscious” -- children exchange information on critical thinking, decision making, conflict resolution, innovation and the prevention of online risks including cyberbullying and grooming. The joint UNICEF Colombia-Tigo strategy uses a learning by doing methodology and a safe internet toolkit.  A highlight is the resulting empowerment of adolescents as they work alongside peers in a training-of-trainings approach focusing on leadership skills, reaching 4,436 adolescents (52 per cent girls and 48 per cent boys) in 2019. The adolescents developed materials for a content hub that speaks directly to their peers on safe internet use and leadership. This is part of the regional UNICEF-Millicom partnership. Millicom, acknowledging the success and potential of the strategy, is preparing a second phase in Colombia and a possible 2020 roll-out with UNICEF Bolivia, based on this experience.
UNICEF partnered with the Ministry of Education, Fundación Escuela Nueva and Opción Legal, for the adaptation of a flexible and inclusive education model for out-of-school children and adolescents entitled learning circles. The idea was to establish a model that can be further be replicated to allow children with educational gaps (including migrant children) to be able to integrate into the formal education through a transitional system of learning and child friendly spaces. It provides guidance in math, language and science according to age and school grade of each child and personalized follow-up for their transition to formal schools. The programme offers psychosocial support and aims to strengthen and restore self-esteem, develop lifeskills, and includes innovative and locally-designed C4D actions to prevent xenophobia and promote a safe and protective environment in school, family and community settings. The circles are flexible regarding administrative entry requirements, responding to the situation and conditions of children. In 2019, the programme reached 1.245 students through 82 learning circles in 4 regions of Colombia. During 2019, the World Bank supported the expansion of three additional learning circles (42 children) in Bogotá, through the provision of pedagogical guidelines and learning materials.
UNICEF also developed three cases of Big/New Data Analysis on education, health and humanitarian response with support from HQ´s innovation unit. A key aspect is the use of public and private data that resulted from partnerships with diverse stakeholders (e. g. private companies, academia and government agencies).  In the first case, the country has a comprehensive mapping of all schools in Colombia with real-time needs; in the second, heath stakeholders are developing state of the art models to predict the spread of vector-borne diseases; and models to depict demographic movements in natural disasters.
b) Lessons Learned: humanitarian-development continuum. 
UNICEF Colombia continued with emergency response initiatives related to the internal conflict as well as in relation to the migration flows. The context of a protracted emergency with an unknown timeframe, ever-changing and unpredictable dynamics point to the need for developing an integrated response going beyond immediate life-saving interventions. For doing so, UNICEF Colombia has prioritized strategic initiatives at the local level that are potentially sustainable through the strengthening of institutional capacity and partnerships with local Governments.
To respond to the “triple affectation” of armed conflict, migration flows and natural disasters, UNICEF Colombia kept its existing programmatic structure, considering it a critical factor for the success in the design, implementation and sustainability of all emergency-related actions. Having the same team work on both emergency and development allowed the office to build on its technical expertise and long-standing partnerships with national and local Governments and enabled a smooth dialogue with partners in alignment with national priorities, and resilience capacity development. This also allowed for a swift and fit-for-purpose response to an evolving situation in the field, with greatly benefited for an enhanced inter-agency coordination, in many cases including operational arrangements such as the use of shared premises.
UNICEF Colombia also grew in staff size mainly through the recruitment of 29 UN Volunteers (junior and senior), based mostly in the field in different areas of the emergency response and coordinate both at field and technical level for an informed, relevant and efficient implementation. The field teams, many with outposted staff and others with a strengthened human resources structure, have focused on capacity strengthening of local government and civil society/NGO partners, with the goal of ensuring sustainability.
This experience points to the need for continuous field presence to ensure the relevance of the response beyond the emergency, to inform the development side of the programme through enhanced coordination between the field and central offices. It also reinforces the importance of maintaining existing and proven coordination mechanisms at the local level that build on local governments response capacity. 
c) Lesson Learned: Local/field-based implementing partners
The emergency response to the migration flow called for an increased field presence in remote and hard-to-reach areas where Government presence has been historically limited. It also called for strong linkages with the development workstreams. To achieve this, UNICEF Colombia sought to work with a wider array of partners with a solid track record who also help ensure relevance of interventions, as this enables a smooth transition to longer-term development work.
UNICEF Colombia worked with 34 implementing partners, reaching 200,000 people through emergency response and 125,000 in its development programme in 20 departments. Out of the total, 25 are Colombian organizations and 11 are community-based. With the latter, UNICEF developed capacity building initiatives on administrative and financial processes, to strengthen local teams and networks, allowing for the consolidation and enhancement of:
-          Cultural relevance: initiatives are adapted and implemented by teams that live in the communities and understand local dynamics and perspectives.
-          Sustainability: these organizations and local governments will continue to work at the local level.
-          Legitimacy within the communities: teams working on the ground are recognized role models.
-          Recognition of communities as active agents and leaders in local communities.
 
"
LACR,Costa Rica,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Key lessons learned have been generated in four frontline areas:  policy impact; innovative modeling; adolescent and youth empowerment and participation; and mainstreaming gender and communication for development.  As the programme enters into the critical halfway point in 2020, country programme leadership will apply these lessons to routine programme implementation as well as to building new models.
 
Costa Rica is a policy-rich country, and the area of children’s rights is no exception, with policies that affect the survival, development, protection and participation rights of children and adolescents.  Nevertheless, this richness contrasts with worsening indicators (violence, poverty and educational exclusion, to name a few) and the seeming difficulty of the policy framework to exert changes.  An example is related to the three life-cycle policies on early childhood, infancy and adolescence, developed in 2018, with limited impacts directly related to the absence of plans of action that assign roles, responsibilities and accountabilities to different national institutions (addressing the bottleneck of weak inter-institutional coordination) and civil society actors (addressing the bottleneck of passive participation at the local levels).  Thus, the formulation of the 2020-2024 Public Policy for Youth with the parallel development of a plan of action represents a solution to improve policy impact and incidence.
 
The hallmark of the 2018-2022 country programme in an upper middle-income country such as Costa Rica is the promotion of innovative models, backed by theories of change, that can be scaled up to resolve national problems that affect the holistic development of children.  There are good examples of successful models such as the Houses of Happiness (already backed by an Executive Decree), Civic Centers Without Walls and Music for Children that confirm the validity of this proof of concept, however, reaching this stage of appropriation requires addressing key challenges. Firstly, modeling from the very start requires the initial buy-in of public institutions to ensure continuity.  The experience to date shows that the consolidation of models can be greatly accelerated if the generation of materials, guidelines and protocols are developed and used by counterparts during the process of upscaling.  Secondly, monitoring instruments and future evaluability criteria need to be ensured from the beginning, so that incorporating baselines, developing indicators and metrics and ensuring a knowledge management system will permit for corrective actions during implementation. Thirdly, the active involvement of partner institutions during the formulation and implementation stages of the models is a critical success factor, including providing the necessary capacity building and advocacy. Finally, acknowledging from the very beginning the different realities at the national and local levels will guarantee designs and approaches that respond more effectively to these scenarios. Applying these lessons will be instrumental for the success of models that are at a point of inflection and takeoff, such as Listening Classrooms and its highly successful volunteer programme (educational exclusion), MERI (empowerment of indigenous women and girls), HALCOM (prevention of family separation), Judicial Mentors (life projects for at-risk youth) and REDESSAM (prevention of self-inflicted violence an
d suicidal ideation).  Throughout this process, it is also important for UNICEF to involve non-traditional partners whose different perspectives may bring value to the process.
 
The country programme has grown in the area of adolescent and youth development, empowerment and participation, facilitated by the incorporation of GenU into our strategic framework and by the number of direct engagement interventions with adolescents and youth already underway. The Committee on the Rights of the Child noted that new programmes and policies designed without adolescent and youth participation will generate limited change, whilst limiting adolescent involvement in the application of the normative framework will also produce little impact.  The programme’s efforts to reach out to and plan, implement and evaluate with adolescents from indigenous, afrodescendent, poor and violent communities, as well as adolescents with disabilities, have produced multiple realities and perspectives that have significantly increased the reach of programme results.  U-Report represents an excellent participatory platform to generate evidence with adolescents and young people. Likewise, the development of models, including their mechanisms of monitoring and evaluation, knowledge generation and theories of change, are bound to be more sustainable if influenced from the beginning with the perspectives of adolescents and youth.  This implies that UNICEF must also ensure that spaces for participation are accompanied with deliberate opportunities to strengthen the skills and competencies of adolescents and youth to ensure that they too are fit for purpose to address challenges and seize opportunities and these have to be specifically incorporated into the annual planning process.  Finally, it is essential to avoid a “one size fits all” approach when working with adolescents and youth and to resist the temptation to develop a standard model for direct replication, and instead promote models that are inclusive and recognize the different idiosyncrasies, needs and interests of adolescents and youth.
 
Costa Rica’s social protection model is being challenged by a fiscal crisis, anti-human rights perspectives and difficulties to reach agreements on the critical pathway regarding children. UNICEF’s work in Costa Rica mainstreaming a gender-focused approach to programming and a more rigorous use of a C4D strategy can help modify social norms that perpetuate the violation of children’s rights and provide a vision for a child-centred society.  To generate more impact, it is important to guarantee that not only are programme counterparts well skilled and trained in these areas but that UNICEF staff possess advanced competencies to help lead the way forward.  Monitoring and evaluation systems that are sensitive enough to measure changes in attitudes and behavior are needed.
 
Looking forward to 2020, UNICEF is well positioned and increasingly fit for purpose to support government institutions, civil society, the private sector, academia, society at large and children and adolescents themselves to advance a paradigm shift which is necessary and urgent to promote in Costa Rica as far as the child rights agenda is concerned.   These lessons will be proactively applied to the 2020 annual work-planning exercise which could be amplified through the implementation of quality control and oversight actions from the Regional Office, for example, sectoral peer reviews and programme audits.
"
LACR,Cuba,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"During the 2019 cooperation Cycle, UNICEF Cuba worked to strengthen and escalate issues related to online protection included in the UNICEF 2018-2021 Strategic Plan in alignment with national, regional and global priorities. This has brought further focus on the prevention and attention to violence affecting children and adolescents.
In Cuba, violence has not been sufficiently present in public debate. Violence against children tends to be perceived as an issue of low incidence and impact in national context. There is a strong trust in State responsibility, capacities and the reach of its institutions to ensure protection for all children.
However, there is a growing presence of this issue in the agenda of institutions, social and professional organizations as well as in the media.
The results of the last MICS round implemented in the country in 2014, show that 36% of girls and boys from 1 to 14 years has been the subject of some violent practice in their home environment, 21% has been the subject of psychological aggression and 26% of physical punishment (out of whom 2,5% of severe physical punishment). In addition to this, some studies show the persistence of cultural and social norms that reproduce gender stereotypes affecting the socialization of children and adolescents (Gender Equity Survey from the Women Studies Center, among others)
In the last years accelerated internet access has emerged as an issue of growing concern.  According to 2020 Digital report on world digital tendencies in social media -2019 data-, 7.1 M Cubans are already connected to internet (63% of the country’s population). At the end of 2019, Cuba’s telecommunications company (ETECSA) announced that there were 3.7 M lines with mobile data access, only one year after the launch of this service.
In that context, the following challenges were identified in a constant dialogue with national authorities, during the CPD 2014-2019. Among those related to the prevention and attention of violence affecting children and adolescents:  

Insufficient knowledge and visibility of this issue which generated at first, certain resistance from Cuban institutions to approach it
Perception about certain types of violence that favor their justification or naturalization
Insufficient risk perception and knowledge of fathers, mothers and other relatives as well as of professionals and specialists from different services and social sectors, on the different types of violence affecting children and adolescents and on their consequences.
Insufficient public systematized information on violence affecting children and adolescents in the national context.  
Risks for the protection of children derived from the late but increasingly accelerated process of informatization of Cuban society, particularly in the use of social media.
During 2014-2019, UNICEF Cuba contributed to the promotion of a culture of rights, protection and participation. Advocacy with authorities and specialists of different sectors as well as technical and financial support and coordination have given greater visibility to topics related to the prevention and attention to violence through the strengthening of institutional and community capacities and the implementation of communication actions.
With the support of UNICEF, in 2019, a number of 1,799 professionals from different sectors (judicial, protection, education, sports, health) received training on issues related to violence with a special focus on gender violence and violence in digital scenarios. They also received information on existing national and international legislations and some communications products created to raise further awareness on these issues such as the initiative “Padre desde el principio” (“Father from the beginning”) and a leaflet and a video on sports. 
The following 2019 results are the base for further development of this area:

Availability of a route map to approach violence with C4D strategies for the 2020- 2024 Country Program as part of an initiative promoted by LACRO.
Availability of an advanced proposal of a communication strategy for all parts of the 2020-2024 country program including the prevention and attention to violence.
Some key lessons learnt are:

The need of a C4D strategy to give a comprehensive approach to violence and promoting the change in the mindset of families and authorities on the violence as a barrier for the integral development of children and adolescents.
Increasing the awareness on violence consequences, there is a need to also increase the supply of services and of the capacities for the prevention and attention to all types of violence.
There is a need of increase the generation of evidence and knowledge management to enhance effective policies and intervention on violence. The intersectoral alliances and exchanges promoted by UNICEF have contributed to the fact that some academic institutions and professional organizations (CIPS, CEJ, ICIC Juan Marinello, Universidad de La Habana, UNJC) further share research results, experiences derived from local interventions and training programs. The latest have had a positive impact in a growing knowledge of the context, a greater focalization of actions, the training of professionals from different sectors and the modelling and escalation of interventions.
The participation of children and adolescents has increased and has evolved from mere attendance to cultural events, to use this cultural space to express their points of views. They have also had a further engagement on proposals to strength protecting spaces and contribute to a better decision-making in different adolescents’ spaces for example: Centro a+ espacios adolescentes, in Old Havana, vulnerable communities of Granma province and in local interventions based on research-action-participation in Havana capital, among others.    
The start of the new (2020-2024) cooperation cycle along with the whole negotiation process related to it, is an opportunity to provide a more solid ground and a further escalation actions and advocacy efforts towards the implementation of a system of integral protection for the protection of children and adolescents
"
LACR,Dominican Republic,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"An important general lesson learned in the implementation of the first two years of the current cycle of Programme Document, is that, in many of the problems that UNICEF tackles in the country, people's behavior has a very important role to play in improving children´s rights. For this reason, UNICEF is strengthening the C4D approach to promote behavioral changes in several of its components such as ECD, Health, and Social Protection[1], which has been added to the important work in the Institutional Strengthening of National Systems[2].
Another important general lesson learned is that the success of programmes generally takes several years, sometimes longer than a CPD period. The programmes in which UNICEF is currently achieving changes at the level of outcomes, and even contributing significantly to the impact, are programmes that were designed several years ago, in which UNICEF was involved since the initial phases (pilots) that were evaluated and were scaled-up to national level with the evidence of these recommendations (maternal and neonatal mortality and birth registration).
The conclusion is that in the cycle of strategic planning, it is important to know in which phase of evolution is each project or intervention, to know how to continue with the next steps with realistic goals. It is important as well that staff have this knowledge to define an annual workplan according to the phase of each project.
One important lesson learned related to the prevention of CMEU, a subject that until now has been considered normal in country, is that UNICEF had to develop several investigations and make intensive political, public and legislative advocacy to put the issue on the public and political agenda, before obtaining institutional commitments.  In summary, research and evaluations are always needed to promote evidence-based decisions and policies, but in several cases, advocacy and campaigns, utilizing the research data, are also needed to obtain political commitments.
Another lesson learned is the importance of a good analysis of the situation, prior to starting programme implementation. UNICEF, from the KAP Study on CMEU, learned that the social determinants and gender roles that normalize early unions in Dominican society are widespread, very strong and greater than expected. Therefore, before working in communities through public institutions, it is necessary to work with the staff of these institutions.
For this reason, it is necessary to sensitize and repeatedly train PROSOLI staff about their own beliefs in this regard, especially at the local level, and in the same way to train teachers about their own beliefs before introducing the prevention initiative of CMEU in schools. In the later phases, UNICEF will need to do intensive training with the staff of other institutions that will work in the prevention of CMEU.
The most important lessons learned from the KAP Study on CMEU are:
a)  Due to the community gender behaviors being so strong (the main conclusion of the KAP) and also being shared by civil servants of local institutions, more effort will be required, and for longer period of time than the one originally planned, to implement a successful CMEU prevention programme.
b) the complexity and magnitude of this problem requires a comprehensive, multi-sectoral approach. 
The conclusion is that, although the theory of change for CMEU prevention remains valid, UNICEF needs to lower its expectations, to adapt them to this reality and adjust programme indicators and scheduling, and to reinforce the support for coordinating with a multi-sectoral working group for the formulation of the National Strategy to Eliminate CMEU.
An important lesson learned in 2019 comes from the evaluation on sexual exploitation initiatives and the advocacy against CMEU supported by UNICEF between 2015-2018. These interventions were evaluated as part of a multi-country regional evaluation focused on the prevention of violence. The recommendations concluded that it is necessary to review the theory of change of the child sexual exploitation component, strengthening the gender approach in all activities in accordance with the Gender Action Plan. UNICEF will implement these recommendations in 2020.
UNICEF learned several lessons in the “Learning for All” programme component. UNICEF has strengthened the education system in the implementation of the new Pedagogical Model of teaching reading, writing and mathematics in the first years of primary education, through:
a) technical assistance in the design a monitoring system for the quality implementation of this Model,
b) implementing this monitoring system in the Villa Mella district,
c) strengthening the leadership of the team and the schools’ pedagogical coordinators, with conceptual and management knowledge, and
d) strengthening their decision-making based on the evidence of the monitoring results.
The lessons learned in this programme are that, to guarantee the full implementation of the new Pedagogical Model, it is necessary to develop highly capable local district technical teams, and school pedagogical coordinators with strong leadership skills, and conceptual and management knowledge. Also, the training of teachers should be focused on improving the pedagogical work carried out in the classroom, and, therefore, the training scenario par excellence is the school itself, through continuous accompaniment and reflexive dialogues that allow progressive adoption of the new Pedagogical Model.
UNICEF utilized the 30th anniversary of the CRC to create a platform to support the participation of adolescents in demanding children´s rights. UNICEF brought together 120 adolescent leaders, who participated in private or public adolescent initiatives at a National Adolescent Summit.
At the Summit, the adolescents discussed the advances in the implementation of the CRC and drafted a Manifesto with 11 action points for the Government. On World Children’s Day, the adolescents took over 30 TV and radio programmes and read their Manifesto. This impactful participation and advocacy initiative culminated with the presentation of the Manifesto to the Vice-President. 
This intervention with adolescents was very time-consuming and demanded the involvement of the staff for several days, thus jeopardizing the normal work of the CO. This forces UNICEF to think of a long-term strategy for working with them, but one which can be implemented with existing human and financial resources.
UNICEF promoted key technological innovations in the public sector in 2019:
a) For the first time, the National Statistical Office (NSO) used tablets in the MICS Household Survey 2019, thus improving the integrity of the information and the speed of its processing. The capacity to continue doing so was established in the NSO, which assured the possibility of it being replicated   in future data collection exercises with national capacities
b) UNICEF designed and supported the implementation of an on-line monitoring system in three local networks of the National Institute for Integrated Attention to Early Childhood (INAIPI), for home visits that the INAPI staff carry out with families with children up to five years old. The recorded data facilitates the monitoring of the evolution of children and families benefiting from these services, and will provide INAIPI with important information to assess the efficiency of their work.

LACR,Ecuador,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The most important lesson on programme implementation is related to the economic and political context of Ecuador and the challenges it entails for programme sustainability. The risks associated with this factor can be summarized as follows: 1) political instability will continue affecting programme implementation due to constant changes at ministerial level and the pre-electoral year; and 2) the macro-economic constrains plus the deal reached with IMF has resulted in cuts in social spending, reduction of public servants and austerity measures which are affecting service delivery, especially in education, health, early childhood services and social protection. This reality requires UNICEF to increase its territorial presence, developing models that can articulate social sector efforts, such as the work being done to reduce chronic malnutrition, and advocate for national and local policies and budgets that support innovative approaches to ensure children’s rights in times of economic crisis.
As part of understanding how local governments can contribute to children’s rights, UNICEF identified opportunities to work with local governments on planning and budgeting at local level with participatory methods that benefit children, adolescents and families, having identified potential areas such as housing, public space, public transport and WASH. 
To improve outcomes in education UNICEF Ecuador in alliance with its private sector partner  Diners Club International co-designed and implemented a strategy that pursues innovative analysis on the current state and the future of education. The initiative is called Edupasión (mixing 'education' and 'passion' to illustrate the purpose of the initiative) and the implementation, in 2019, focused on a communication strategy to create and disseminate messages to the audience specifically interested in education and development. The strategy reached 10,776 people through videos. Additionally, 30 documents on the current state of the education system and innovative ideas on how to improve them are being analyzed by the steering committee of Edupasión, which includes UNICEF and Diners Club Ecuador, our main corporate partner.
UNICEF Ecuador also worked on U-Report, launching five surveys with different groups of adolescents and youth organizations on issues agreed with with them such as: women representation in media, sex education, quality of education, cyberbullying and climate change. The voices and opinions of 1,730 young people were part of this initial phase and the results were used by them to raise awareness of public authorities about the different issues that affect their lives.
In September, UNICEF CO started a pilot initiative that entails the recruitment of face-to-face fundraisers through United Nations Volunteers (UNV). The agreement with UNV at country level included dialogue with our respective HQs and ROs. The pilot project had an intended duration of 6 months, which has been extended for another 6 months given initial satisfactory results. This will allow us to draw lessons learned from implementation, evaluate the efficiency of this pilot and measure results adequately. 
As part as the global Memorandum of Understanding between High Commissioner on Refugees, World Food Programme, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and UNICEF, Ecuador CO is participating in a pilot project for harmonization of cash transfer programmes in humanitarian contexts, which aims to improve effectiveness and efficiency of this type of interventionns
Finally, understanding that the human mobility crisis from Venezuela requires strong advocacy, UNICEF Ecuador supported the World Bank initiative to conduct a Living Conditions Survey on Venezuelan migrants and host communities in Ecuador. This study, while executed by the World Bank, included financial support from UNICEF and five other UN Agencies and it provides evidence-based data about the situation and deprivations that Venezuelan and Ecuadorian households in host communities are facing. The study aims at influencing a policy agenda that addresses their social and economic inclusion, and it draws policy recommendations under three pillars: 1) strengthening social, political and economic opportunities; 2) developing and strengthening national and local capabilities; and 3) lifting barriers for social and economic integration. Besides contributing financially, UNICEF also contributed by providing insights on how to link findings with children’s rights, and is currently analyzing the data to develop a policy ask and raise funds to plug the needs of children on the move and children on host communities.
"
LACR,El Salvador,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"2019 was a transitional year for El Salvador. In June, a new government assumed office. This transition produced institutional changes and changes in government priorities. UNICEF El Salvador successfully leveraged the change in context to position key topics in the political agenda which, in some cases have been adopted by the new administration, including early childhood development, and the need to increase investment in children. In the first half of 2020, the Presidency will launch its National Policy on Early Childhood Development, developed in 2019 with the support of the CO in partnership with World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB).
The CO was successful in leveraging the main political, social and economic events in the country to position its advocacy for children in both the public and private sector. To substantiate its advocacy, the CO presented robust evidence on the situation of children, and effectively partnered with prestigious academic institutions and thinktanks, such as New York University Global Ties for Children. This strategic positioning allowed for the generation of new alliances with public-private sector actors that have been instrumental in achieving an increase in the amount of funding assigned to children and adolescents, both from the State as well as from development banks.
In the context of political transitions, to promote the continuity of plans and programs from former administrations and/or agreements stemming from previous high-level political dialogues, an evidence-based approach that adds visibility to the situation of children and demonstrates the impact on children and families should current plans not be maintained, is required to underpin the construction of an effective narrative which, must also be aligned to reflect priorities as defined by new government authorities. In 2019, the CO contributed to position continuity of interventions in the education sector to respond to both short-term and mid-term goals defined by the 2030 Agenda.
The CO works at a national level promoting public policies and programs designed to be implemented by the government, however, it also works, although with limitations, locally with the objective of creating intervention models that can be positioned for scaling-up to the national level through the identification of best practices and lessons learned. An example of this is the adoption by the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education of the innovative Care for Child Development (CCD) Approach promoted by UNICEF.
To achieve scalability of these interventions and to reach children and their families, coordination and collaboration among local and state level actors is essential. UNICEF has, in several instance, played a key role in facilitating these alliances at a local level. This facilitation is fundamental for ensuring that children and their families have access to comprehensive services through the implementation of strategies such as the ’Territorialización’ strategy for early childhood development, and local-level violence prevention. These strategies have proven that the creation of coordinating systems with a multi-sectorial approach allow for the achievement of higher coverage, better quality of services, and increased commitment from diverse actors towards a common collective practice, addressing knowledge gaps, and providing more sustainable and efficient funding.
To foster the institutionalization and scalability of interventions, a robust monitoring and evaluation evidence-based framework rooted in quantitative and qualitative analysis is essential. To this end, the CO has increased its investments in monitoring and evaluation, that have informed result-based decision-making processes, as well as fostered continuous learning processes for all parties involved.
UNICEF El Salvador has also successfully positioned itself to leverage the reform taking place in United Nations by increasing collaboration with other system agencies, funds and programmes. This positioning was instrumental for example to respond to slow-onset emergencies, such as droughts and floods experienced.
UNICEF El Salvador has proven that, by including children and adolescents with disabilities in our preparation and emergency response processes, the capacity of people and families to organize and face risks and crisis is increased. Likewise, timely and articulated emergency response to situations require the existence of effective coordination systems, as well as robust and up-to-date statistical data to support the planning processes for response interventions.
During the cooperation cycle, UNICEF El Salvador has promoted innovative communication methodologies for development, capacity building and skill development to address and combat gender stereotypes. Examples include the methodology implemented with the NGO CONTEXTOS to support returned migrants to address trauma and other experiences using reading and writing for them to articulate their experiences, or the adaptation of the methodology designed by Musicians without Borders to the El Salvador educational system which promotes peaceful coexistence in schools through music.
El Salvador is affected by global and regional phenomena including migration, climate change, and epidemics such as ZIka virus among other Arbovirosis. In this regard, the CO has participated in evaluations, studies, and sub-regional initiatives to comprehensive address these problems that affect the country with the purpose of finding and implementing effective solutions, together with nations facing common challenges.
2019 marked the conclusion of the Zika prevention and response program, notwithstanding the marked increase in cases of Arbovirosis in El Salvador. Suspected cases of dengue increased from 8,443 in 2018 to 27,470 registered cases in 2019, representing a 225% surge. Support to national authorities for Arbovirosis prevention and response will continue to be a priority for the CO. In this connection, work undertaken will need to continue promoting the CCD approach, to directly benefit the care received by children and children with disabilities and their families through its multisectoral approach that incorporates and involves education, protection, health, and nutrition.
During 2019, progress in strengthening collaborative and coordinating efforts with COs in Honduras and Guatemala for the protection and inclusion of children in the education system are a case in point. Together with Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala, the CO has worked to protect the rights of migrant children. Building on this approach and leveraging work undertaking in 2019, the Mesoamerica Education initiative with the IADB will allow for the exchange of best practices, the identification of scalable solutions and of monitoring and evaluation frameworks in 2020 and 2021.
"
LACR,Guatemala,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Habiendo concluido el quinto año del ciclo de cooperación, viendo que los indicadores sobre la niñez casi no mejoran, y tomando como referencia el último informe del Comité de los Derechos del Niño del 2018, UNICEF tiene claro que hay una gran necesidad de ajustar los modelos de intervención para acelerar progresos para la infancia y cambiar el rumbo del país para que pueda cosechar el bono demográfico. Este bono corre el peligro de convertirse en una carga demográfica si Guatemala no resuelve los altos índices de pobreza, la carga de malnutrición crónica, la violencia y otras injusticias que atentan contra la dignidad y futuro potencial de los niños, niñas y adolescentes. 
Del ciclo anterior al corriente, el presupuesto del programa de UNICEF aumentó con USD 10 millones más para enfrentar de mejor manera los grandes retos que afectan a la niñez. Sin embargo, los retos subsisten. 
UNICEF sabe que se debe seguir trabajando para apoyar la creación de un ambiente propicio con las leyes, políticas, presupuestos y programas adecuados para dar oportunidades a toda la niñez de sobrevivir, crecer, jugar, educarse y crear su propio proyecto de vida. Haciendo cumplir sus derechos, Guatemala se beneficiará como país en términos de mayor equidad, cohesión social, y competitividad. También está claro que la Oficina debe seguir trabajando con las instituciones y las comunidades para mejorar la oferta y la demanda de servicios de calidad para la niñez. Es necesario trabajar en el nivel sistémico, institucional e individual, junto con las familias. A la vez, hay que repensar algunos supuestos sobre la cooperación, reconociendo que la velocidad, la escala y la sostenibilidad de los programas apoyados por UNICEF también siguen siendo desafíos críticos.
En el ámbito de las innovaciones se evidencia la necesidad y el reto de promover nuevas líneas o formas de trabajo. En este sentido, UNICEF lanzó nuevas áreas de trabajo como Innovación, Business for Results, y Recaudación de Fondos Corporativos e Individuales. UNICEF firmó un Convenio de Cooperación con el Campus TEC para desarrollar el primer Laboratorio de Innovación por la Infancia en Guatemala. Además, se llevó a cabo la “Semana de la Innovación” junto con el PNUD, y UNICEF llevó a cabo la primera “Ideatón” enfocada en buscar soluciones para prevenir y atender la violencia en el entorno educativo.
En síntesis, las lecciones aprendidas de este año son cuatro:
1. La importancia y efectividad de diseñar e implementar una estrategia de comunicación e incidencia en el período electoral. Anticipándose al período electoral, a finales de diciembre del 2018 ya se tenía una claridad programática y política para posicionar los temas prioritarios de la infancia. Esto permitió elaborar e implementar una estrategia de incidencia multimedia y de movilización social en torno a la formación de un Movimiento Nacional por la Infancia. Producto de esta estrategia se llegó a socializar con un alto grado de consenso la “Agenda Prioritaria por la Infancia” (Primera infancia, Adolescencia y Protección) en los medios de comunicación, partidos políticos, sector privado y ciudadanía.
 
2. La necesidad de seguir cambiando prácticas y algunas normas sociales. Las lecciones aprendidas del 2019 y de los años anteriores confirman la relevancia del Modelo Socio Ecológico, SEM, que sustenta la labor programática y de la Comunicación para el Desarrollo, centrada en el niño, basada en la comunidad y con acciones y actores estratégicos en los diferentes niveles de intervención hasta el nivel político central, incidiendo en políticas y programas para lograr escalabilidad y sostenibilidad. A pesar de la gran carga de malnutrición y de violencia que vive la niñez guatemalteca, estos graves problemas siguen viéndose como algo “normal” y aún no accionan una consciencia social para enfrentarlas.  Es claro que aún se deben colocar estos temas en el debate público y social y trabajar la crianza positiva desde varios frentes a la vez.
3. La necesidad de trabajar cada vez más en alianza con otros cooperantes para lograr impacto y trazar el camino hacia el logro de los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible, ODS. UNICEF ya tiene varios acuerdos en marcha en ese sentido. El 2020, con el apoyo financiero de la Unión Europea, UE, y en coordinación con OPS y el PMA, UNICEF comenzará un proyecto de cuatro años para reducir la desnutrición crónica en 22 municipios que presentan los más altos índices de desnutrición. El Gobierno de Canadá contribuye para generar cambios catalíticos en el ámbito de programas innovadores para los adolescentes y jóvenes, alineada a la Agenda de Juventud de la Sede de UNICEF. El Reino de Suecia colabora con UNICEF para institucionalizar y escalar un Sistema de Protección Integral de la Infancia.
4. La necesidad de enfocar la inversión. UNICEF tiene la intención de ser un actor catalítico en la transformación de Guatemala hacia una sociedad que valora y protege a cada uno de sus niños y niñas, en todas partes y siempre. Para tomar este papel con mayor fuerza, UNICEF considera oportuno enfocar su futura inversión con mayor énfasis en la prevención de la violencia contra los niños, niñas, y adolescentes, dado que en una jerarquía de necesidades, la niñez que sufre de violencia difícilmente podrá beneficiarse de los servicios sociales y de justicia porque está siempre en una situación de estrés toxico y es incapaz de desarrollarse como debe ser. Además, basados en los hallazgos de la neurociencia, UNICEF considera pertinente enfocar su cooperación hacia la primera infancia y la adolescencia, siendo dos etapas de la vida que son de suma importancia en el desarrollo del ser humano, la primera y segunda ventana de oportunidades, respectivamente.

LACR,Guyana,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"LESSONS LEARNED
Leveraging the Demand for & Utilization of Evidence for Decisions -- Through continued advocacy and generation of high-quality evidence, UNICEF has seen an increased demand for and utilization of evidence for decision making in both countries. Partners report less sensitivity of existing data and increase demand for evidence for planning or reporting, case in point Guyana’s voluntary national report for the Sustainable Development Goals. Child-sensitive social protection was put on the policy table through UNICEF-assisted evidence generation MICS-6. Showing and “making the social protection schemes more visible” proved to be a strong tool for engaging on child-friendly budgeting and social inclusion including multiple child deprivations. MICS was a crucial source of data for Guyana, as it informed about 40% of the indicators at household level for the national development plan and the VNR in Guyana. In 2020, MICS-6 data will be a major source of information for the Suriname-VNR.
Value-for-Money and Cost-sharing Approach increased commitment for Public Finance for Children -- UNICEF advocated for more fiscal space for children, by promoting Public Financing for Children and brokering discussions in new areas like value-for-money. The advocacy included capacity building and awareness on multi-dimensional child poverty. As a result and for the first time, both countries have allocated tangible financial resources to MICS-6, with over US$ 300,000 in Guyana and US$ 526,000 in Suriname. Such commitment paved the path for increased public finance for children and fiscal space to address child poverty and deprivation. In 2020, efforts will be made to influence the newly-elected Government (both countries) to leverage more resources for children, especially from oil incomes.
Review of Theory of Change (ToC) and Results Logic -- As a part of the midterm cycle review of the Country Programme, eight (8) programme strategy notes -including ToC/result framework were reviewed and aligned to the UNICEF Strategic Plan 2018-2021, regional (i.e. 4 flagships) and national priorities. This will also guide the 202-2021 work planning.
Balancing of upstream and downstream -- The implementation of the country program has been made using a sound balancing of upstream and downstream work in 2019. Several high-level efforts were made to influence policies and plans in favour of children as mentioned earlier. However, the political situation in Guyana and in Suriname have been bit challenging and affected the “policy window opportunity” to some extent. Despite these turbulences, building on strong alliances at technical level has facilitated the implementation of the Programme.
INNOVATIONS
Value-for-Money in Evaluation -- For the first time, UNICEF included value-for-money criteria in evaluation. These criteria were comingled with the DAC evaluation criteria to form a robust complement for the Sport and Culture for Development (SC4D) evaluation. Findings included a need to increase the scope of gender as a cross-cutting criterion and to add ‘environment’ as a new evaluation criterion. Amidst climate change and global Oceans’ regulations, the environmental impact of programs is recommended.
Technology-assisted Evidence Generation -- Tablets have been used for collecting data in the MICS (CAPI) round 6 in both countries. While UNICEF has championed the use of computer-assisted data collection, it is a first in Guyana and in Suriname with a direct result of fast-tracking and improving data quality and efficiency in the processing phase (reducing time from 3 months to 3 weeks). This technology-assisted evidence generation experiences have since been replicated by national exercises, beyond MICS. In Suriname, the use of T4D concepts via easy-to-use mobile and web application of the EDUstars quality model allowed for decentralized action planning adapting to the local context of the school system. It should be noted that Suriname was the first in LAC region to produce the MICS-6 report in July 2019. Guyana has collected data in 2019 and will finalise the MICS-6 report in early 2020.
Child Friendly Community Initiative -- In Suriname, UNICEF piloted a child-friendly community initiative by utilizing the existing structures at the community level. Through this programme, UNICEF supported to assess the financial-management capacity and for the first time, transferred funds directly to the community. This accelerated the design, implementation and community ownership of the programme on ECD.
Innovative Partnership in Emergency -- Partnering with the Faculty of Technology of the University of Guyana, field assessments for civil engineering and architectural work were conducted by students in 6 schools (Region 1) to absorb migrant children from Venezuela.  Students scoped and documented environmentally appropriate designs to double the learning space and decrease the footprint to ensure that all children enjoy a comfortable workspace. The work met the parameters of the Safe School initiative and allows schools to cater for more migrant children in need.

LACR,Haiti,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Adapter les programmes UNICEF à l’évolution du pays 
Alors que le Programme pays (CPD) 2017-2021 est arrivé à mi-parcours, l’évolution de la situation du pays nécessite d’adapter les programmes d’UNICEF Haïti. Le CPD 2017-2021 avait initialement été conçu sur la base de données provenant de l’Enquête de morbidité, de la mortalité et de l’utilisation des services (EMMUS 2012). Cependant, les données actualisées de l’EMMUS VI (2017) ont démontré un niveau élevé de disparités dans le pays en termes d'accès et d'utilisation des services sociaux, en particulier dans les domaines de la vaccination, de la nutrition et de la WASH. Le pays a par ailleurs adopté des plans et politiques stratégiques sectoriels répondant aux nouvelles priorités nationales[1]. Cette persistance des disparités d’accès plaide pour un renforcement des approches de programmation axées sur l'équité et régies par des critères de ciblage des risques et de la vulnérabilité dans un contexte où le changement climatique exacerbe ces défis. Compte tenu des progrès accomplis dans la lutte contre l’épidémie de choléra, l’orientation et la couverture[2] du programme Eau, Assainissement, Hygiène sera recalibré autour de l’ensemble des maladies d'origine hydrique et des objectifs en matière d’assainissement.
UNICEF Haïti s’est engagé à maintenir et à renforcer son leadership et son soutien dans la production de données afin d’étayer le conseil stratégique au Gouvernement, la programmation et la mobilisation des ressources à travers (i) la mise en œuvre d'une enquête SMART, prévue en janvier 2020 pour fournir des données actualisées et détaillées sur les taux de malnutrition, (ii) l'élaboration d'une cartographie des normes sociales qui conditionnent l'utilisation des services sociaux au niveau communautaire ; (iii) l'analyse et la caractérisation de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle des enfants afin d'accroître la prise en compte des enfants dans la politique nationale de protection sociale.
U-Report :Lancé en Haïti en 2019, U-Report est un outil numérique, gratuit et anonyme mis à la disposition des jeunes haïtiens par UNICEF[3] pour leur permettre de s’exprimer sur les problématiques qui concernent leurs communautés. U-Report est aussi un moyen d’information, de sensibilisation, de mobilisation et d’engagement des jeunes, grâce au partage de messages sur des thématiques diverses concernant le droit des enfants ou les vulnérabilités des enfants. Les sensibilisations pour les inscriptions à U-Report seront renforcées en 2020 afin d’augmenter la voix des jeunes pour faire changer la société.
Renforcer la préparation aux urgences, la réduction des risques aux désastres et le nexus humanitaire – développement
Compte tenu de l'instabilité politique croissante et de la grande vulnérabilité du pays aux catastrophes naturelles ou causées par l'homme, le renforcement de la préparation aux urgences, notamment par le maintien de stocks de contingence et la coordination des secteurs, demeure une priorité constante pour la réponse aux urgences et la réduction des risques de catastrophe (RRC) et le nexus[4] humanitaire-développement.
Les activités d'adaptation au changement climatique seront renforcées dans tous les programmes, conformément aux recommandations de l'étude d’Analyse du paysage climatique pour les enfants (CLAC) réalisée en 2019. Cette approche devrait également permettre de tirer parti des opportunités de partenariat avec UNEP et FAO dans le cadre des financements pour l'adaptation au changement climatique du programme de préparation et d'aide au Fonds mondial pour la lutte contre le changement climatique. Une évaluation des initiatives basées sur les transferts monétaires sera nécessaire pour apprécier l'effet sur les capacités d'anticipation, d'absorption et d'adaptation des individus, des ménages et des communautés aux crises.
Promouvoir la lutte contre les violences faites aux enfants
Compte tenu de la prévalence endémique de diverses formes de violence en Haïti, UNICEF Haïti continuera son travail en faveur de l’élimination de la violence à l'égard des enfants. Plusieurs initiatives existent déjà, notamment dans le volet éducation, qui pourraient être encore renforcées. La violence à l'encontre des enfants entraîne de nombreuses conséquences potentielles, telles que des retards de développement, affectifs et intellectuels, mais également des conséquences sur la santé physique, telles que la grossesse chez les filles. Les manifestations de violences à l’encontre des enfants en Haïti devraient être analysées à l'aide des dernières données, afin que des interventions appropriées puissent être conçues avec les partenaires pour traiter le problème de manière holistique et pluriannuelle.
Poursuivre la réflexion sur la jeunesse
La jeunesse est un thème transversal de premier plan qui retient davantage l'attention de l’UNICEF. En lien avec le partenariat Generation Unlimited (GenU) qui regroupe les Nations Unies, les gouvernements et le secteur privé, UNICE Haïti cherchera à renforcer sa programmation vers les adolescents et les jeunes afin de mettre fin à la violence, réduire le nombre de mariages et de grossesses précoces, réduire le décrochage scolaire, augmenter la participation des adolescents, etc. Dans le cadre de l’appui à la Deuxième Décennie, la validation de la première politique nationale d’éducation alternative a permis de jeter les bases d’une offre éducative améliorée pour un demi-million d’enfants Haïtiens en dehors du système scolaire. Les besoins et les opportunités soulevés dans ce domaine justifient de poursuivre le soutien à la formation professionnelle et à l’éducation non formelle afin de renforcer l’apprentissage et l’employabilité des jeunes, ainsi qu’une plus large intégration multisectorielle, en renforçant les activités de la santé, de la nutrition, de la WASH et de la protection à l’égard et avec les adolescents et les jeunes. Il est également pertinent de renforcer l’implication du secteur privé (chambre de commerce) dans la formation et la réinsertion professionnelle des adolescents.

LACR,Honduras,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In the middle of this year, the country office, together with the Foreign Ministry and the Secretariat General of Government Coordination, conducted a Mid-Term Review of the country programme in terms of improving the relevance and validity of the change strategies proposed for the current cooperation cycle 2017-2021. The persistence of extreme poverty, high levels of violence, education in crisis, mass migration phenomena and fragility in the face of emergency situations affecting the country made this adjustment necessary. The lessons learned from previous years and from management that facilitated this change are summarised below:
1. Education in the context of violence and migration.
In order to make education a starting point to address the root causes of violence and migration, viewing the school as an integration platform, the strategy of cooperation in education was reoriented in the following direction:

Geographical focus: in municipalities with high levels of violence[1], an intersectoral approach was proposed that includes interventions in education, protection, social inclusion and communication with a gender and intercultural perspective. The target population is estimated at 425,000 adolescents (220,000 in school and 205,000 out of school).
Safe learning environments[2]: Through a community-based approach and building on the teachings and outcomes of the Education for Peace-Coexistence-Citizenship and Educational Bridges strategy. This included the involvement of community organisations to foster safe environments, the involvement of student governments, the promotion of sports/recreational clubs and community education, and the creation of safe environments for children with disabilities. Strategic alliances were also developed that allowed for rapid advancement in the concept of Safe Learning Environments (USAID).
Alternative learning and educational bridges: the idea was to take advantage of ICTs and technological and non-technological innovations to increase access to education and improve learning for excluded children and adolescents, focusing on the specific needs of children on the move (displaced by violence and poverty, returning migrants). In partnership with IDB, an Innovation in Education Network was built.
Relevant education: it is important to ensure that learning is holistic and skills-based education is relevant and applicable to the needs of mainly adolescent women, teenage mothers, and adolescents with disabilities. The current administration partnered with the Special Olympics, which is intended to be gradually strengthened to increase visibility of this population that experiences high levels of exclusion.
Systematic monitoring of results: Standardised and disaggregated indicators are being developed to better tell the story of outcomes in children and adolescents, including the development of indicators on access (for children on the move, the most disadvantaged adolescents, children/adolescents with disabilities), safety (physical and psychological), violence reduction, etc.
2. Community-based violence reduction model. 
The results of the Violence Against Children survey, which contributed to the development of the National Violence Reduction Plan, identified that the greatest exposure to violent incidents occurs in schools, homes and the community. It is therefore necessary to develop a community strategy for the reduction of violence aimed at changing social norms and interrupting the processes of violence in order to reduce the high rates of homicides and femicides, through actions focused on homes, community spaces and schools.
UNICEF has contributed to improved resilience to the effects of violence in communities it partnered with by implementing strategies to change social norms and strengthen community-based organisations (CBOs) for the prevention and reduction of violence. UNICEF defined differentiated prevention and violence reduction strategies based each community’s vulnerabilities to violence, exposure levels and local capacities, prioritising the Cure Violence Global (CVG) violence and homicide interruption in the country’s most violent communities, with a focus on reducing and interrupting violence against girls, women and femicide.
CVG has traditionally been more focused on youth and adult homicide reduction. UNICEF has been working with them to develop an innovative intervention that seeks to not only interrupt homicide in target communities, but also interrupt femicide and violence against girls and women. UNICEF and CVG have fine-tuned the measurement instruments and methodology for training and supporting the work of community-based volunteer violence interrupters.
UNICEF and CVG expect to increase coverage in San Pedro Sula, and open new community partnerships in La Ceiba and Tegucigalpa. In the industrial city of Choloma, UNICEF and CVG adopted a different strategy, partnering directly with the municipal government rather than community-based partners, to train and support municipal violence interrupters who work to reduce gang-related and gender-based violence and homicide interruption in the most conflictive neighbourhoods. The idea is that by working with the local government, UNICEF and CVG will achieve greater sustainability once technical support and funding has ceased.
UNICEF promoted partnerships to identify and adopt best practices in sexual and GBV prevention, including promoting joint workshops with national, municipal and local stakeholders to jointly develop and implement local interventions. Part of this work included adapting local methodologies which work on girls’ empowerment and develop non-violent masculinity with boys and adolescents.
UNICEF Honduras integrating its community-based violence reduction work, readjusting programming in child protection, education and social inclusion to better respond to the complex realities of urban violence, creating protective spaces within schools, communities and its municipal strengthening strategy. In collaboration with key partners, UNICEF will support the implementation of effective local violence and homicide reduction interventions that are monitored and assessed through a robust set of epidemiological indicators.
3. The municipality as a platform for program alignment
UNICEF has favoured a greater local presence with very good results. Municipal governments have shown a high level of political will and program implementation. The Integral System to Guarantee Rights began its operation with the installation of the Municipal Councils and the children’s offices, this later escalated to achieve the results discussed in depth in the report.
The local level is the most decentralised level of public management and, therefore, favours the development of a platform for program alignment where the rights of development, survival, protection and participation are forced to align. This level of government, because of its closeness to communities, is more likely to produce concrete results that promote changes in the lives of Honduran children and adolescents.
The design of the modules taking into account the standards and tools of territorial management of the country, has made the exercise much easier and applicable for municipalities. The approach of “learning by doing” gradually and progressively has been useful to ensure the understanding of the logic behind results-based management by municipal officials, making it possible for tools and products resulting from the application of methodologies to be really useful for public managers.
Municipal officials’ level of understanding and ownership of the process of public management for children has qualitatively improved the leadership conditions of the municipality in the Municipal Council. Timely advocacy and high-level technical assistance helped to build relationships with key government authorities to identify UNICEF as the best trusted partner. On-going monitoring of public management, identification and understanding of its strengths, as well as sensitivity to its needs, also helped.
These elements, together with good communication, have favoured the assimilation of abstract concepts related to the Integral System to Guarantee Rights, improvement of information systems, multidimensional poverty measurements, monitoring of institutional results (performance indices) and have also accelerated the assimilation of methodological innovations in child finance, as well as the incorporation of ICTs.
Achievements have brought the management of the Association of Honduran Municipalities closer to UNICEF and through a joint work agreement that will be developed during the next administration. Work with municipalities will move towards measuring changes in the lives of children and adolescents with a monitoring system that includes consensual indicators. The visibility of the results by municipality will make it possible to identify the best experiences around which a learning community will be established along with an associated incentive system. The Education Innovation Network will feed from the most innovative experiences that achieve results in highly challenging contexts. AMHON’s Annual Assembly will be the stage where this progress is recognised annually.

LACR,Jamaica,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Section 3: Lessons Learned and Innovations
Integrated Strategy on Violence against Children
In 2019, UNICEF Jamaica took a deliberate approach to combine communication, advocacy and programming efforts for a concentrated and sustained focus on violence against children over several months, under the banner of the commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the Conventions on the Rights of the Child. A multi-pronged strategy was developed with inputs from the entire office. It included programmatic interventions at community level, donor engagement, evidence-generation activities to inform advocacy and a communication and social mobilization campaign. The strategy was continuously monitored and adjusted throughout the year as plans evolved.
Throughout the process, the office learned about the importance of engaging children in a meaningful way and for different outcomes – both as participants from whom we could glean useful information, and as advocates (as young as age seven) who could speak out as powerful messengers to gain national attention in a unique way. We also gained valuable insight about the significance of combining evidence generation, high-level advocacy with on-the-ground interventions and driving momentum towards an ultimate event that pulled these initiatives together with a singular advocacy objective focused on violence against children. These simultaneous efforts culminated in a Special Session on Violence against Children in Parliament – a major advocacy event in which children presented to the Parliament for the first time in Jamaican history and called on the government to take action. Both the Government and Opposition expressed commitments to the operationalization of the National Plan of Action for an Integrated Response to Children and Violence, which was launched on the same day. The Special Session had extensive media coverage – in one week, UNICEF Jamaica reached 1.4 million people, of whom 108,000 were engaged on social media.
Bottlenecks to Drive Legislative Reform on VAC and Adolescent Health Services
Jamaica is yet to become one of the countries where children enjoy full legal protection from corporal punishment at home and at school.  For instance, teachers are still justified in administering “moderate and reasonable” corporal punishment under common law.  Despite the expressed intentions of the Government of Jamaica to  ban corporal punishment, legislative and policy reform is moving at a very slow pace as this is a very controversial and politically charged issue which faces strong opposition from several religious groups and the general public. A similar situation is faced by the Ministry of Health and Wellness (MoHW) with their intentions to increase the provision of adolescent-friendly sexual and reproductive health services. This expansion remains challenged by ongoing legal restrictions in service delivery for girls and boys below age 16 without parental consent.  
To expedite legislation and policy reform in those areas, it is clear that UNICEF needs to step up its advocacy at all levels, continue to engage in evidence generation and legislative analysis, increase the outreach of social mobilization campaigns and continue to provide technical capacity to MoEYI and MoHW to drive those necessary changes.
Sharpening the Gender Focus of UNICEF’s Programme
UNICEF Jamaica initiated a process to sharpen the gender focus of programme interventions with the implementation of a Gender Programme Review (GPR).  The review provided necessary support to assess, identify and prioritize strategic areas in which to introduce or strengthen gender responsive programming in alignment with the UNICEF Strategic Plan and the Gender Action Plan (GAP II) 2018-2022.  The results of the GPR are helping the programme team to shift towards a more integrated, holistic and gender transformative approach in the implementation of the country programme across the different programmatic areas. The results also lay a solid foundation for a more gender sensitive consideration of strategies as the office approaches a new programme cycle. The report highlighted key areas of alignment with the GAP II and indicated areas for improved focus including advocacy and C4D aimed at changing harmful social norms that put girls and boys at risk and ensuring learning opportunities for a greater understanding of the implications of gender on programming. For interventions to be gender responsive and/or gender transformative, it is not enough to focus on the reproductive roles of women and girls. Gender sensitive interventions must reflect an understanding of the social and cultural factors involved in gender-based exclusion and discrimination and take these into account.  
In this vein, during the year, UNICEF consulted with 30 key stakeholders – including adolescent girls – to better understand the national response to high levels of sexual abuse of girls and gaps in prevention and service delivery. Stakeholders from health, education, child protection and gender discussed the issue and proposed solutions aimed at prevention, which include school and community-based initiatives, service delivery activities and changes in social norms which would also focus on engagement of men and boys as part of the solution. These proposed solutions were taken into account as UNICEF joined the rest of the UN in Jamaica to draft a successful proposal to the European Union and leveraged some 8 million euro to address family violence in Jamaica, including sexual abuse of girls. The Spotlight Initiative will seek to stem family violence and its impact on women and girls.   UNICEF is the UN recipient organization in charge of the Prevention and Social Norms Pillar of the Spotlight Jamaica Country programme. 
Review of the UN MSDF Approach for UNICEF Offices in the English-Dutch Caribbean 
In this third year of implementation of the current country programme, UNICEF Jamaica went through a series of mid-term reflection meetings with partners, one per each of the programmatic outcomes of Jamaica’s Country Programme Document (CPD). The objective of this process was to take stock of the progress made on the implementation of the CPD and the programme strategic notes and identify new potential areas of engagement for the future based on the latest evidence. These exercises demonstrated the validity of the current theory of changes and also served to identify several emerging priorities on which to keep a close eye for the rest of the cycle. These include climate change and disaster risk reduction, adolescent mental health, gender-based violence, online violence and de-institutionalization of children in state care. This process also informed the joint Strategic Moment of Reflection for English and Dutch Caribbean Country Offices conducted in October in collaboration with UNICEF’s Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean.   
One of the findings of this common review was that despite UNICEF’s engagement with the Multi Country Sustainable Development Framework (UN MSDF) and the existence of a common results framework among UNICEF offices in the Caribbean, UNICEF and the UN system as a whole are still not maximizing the opportunities that the framework provides for more integrated programming, fundraising and aggregation of results. With UNICEF moving soon into the planning of the next programme cycle, it is necessary to undertake a strategic review of the MSDF among UN agencies in the near future – within the context of ongoing Multi Country Offices review –to respond to the request from many Small Island Developing States (SIDS) for a more tailored engagement from the UN.
"
LACR,Mexico,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Concluding the six years of the CPD 2014-2019, the following lessons are noted by UNICEF Mexico to enhance the implementation of the new country programme:
Programming with a Government in transition
2019 was the first year of the new government, which implied important changes to UNICEF’s way of working. Many of the initiatives that demanded several years of UNICEF’s work, such as the protection of migrant children and adolescents and policy changes towards non-detention, were impacted by continuous change in leadership; this goes as well in terms of the non-implementation of the education reform and other sectoral policies. This also meant that relationship building had to be restarted from zero, which was a setback from progress and investment in network and alliance building during the 2018 transition period. An important lesson learned in terms of programming during government transition is to have contingency plans and risk mitigation plans in place, to ensure continuity of initiatives despite changes in the government administration. In addition, planning of activities must be done with care as a good number might not be accomplished with the change of hierarchy and relationships within institutions and across sectors.
Field Monitoring 
Although, programmatic visits to the field have always been a practice in the Office, as a result of the 2019 Audit, the Office has identified the need to improve field monitoring, basically by drawing up an office-wide field-visit monitoring plan to ensure appropriate coverage, scale and frequency of field-monitoring visits. The quality of such visits should also be improved by making sure that primary objectives are achieved and that staff are trained accordingly to conduct this exercise. There is also the need to establish a mechanism to ensure regular follow-up of key recommendations arising from field visits. With the introduction of eTools, the Office will enhance the quality of field monitoring reporting, as this tool provides the space to upload detailed reports and follow up on action points that are agreed after such field visits. In 2019, all staff received training on the use of the tools.
Evaluation
One of the challenges over the programme cycle has been to ensure the quality and standard of evaluations. To evaluate, per se, is a critical exercise for the office to identify impacts of programmes, projects and initiatives. Nevertheless, there have been several obstacles in ensuring quality evaluations. Many companies or institutions that offer to evaluate projects do not have the capacity expected by UNICEF in terms of quality assurance. The Office has also undertaken complex evaluations of simple projects or for which the design was not adequate. As a result, despite serious efforts from the part of the Office to carry evaluations to a certain standard, the last two evaluations have been rated as unsatisfactory.  However, it is worth noting that counterparts have found the evaluations very useful and based adjustments and improvements for the future on these evaluations. 
While evaluation is also a good practice to determine whether a pilot initiative can or should be taken to scale, not all pilot initiatives can be evaluated, as per HQ standards and one should also recognize the limits to what an evaluation can do. It is also important to determine beforehand whether the recommended evaluation is feasible or the necessary type: some initiatives could benefit more from a process or design evaluation rather than an impact evaluation.
Advocacy
Advocacy is another area where the office learned important lessons from this year. During 2019 the country achieved important breakthroughs on three specific issues related to children, and in which UNICEF Mexico played a crucial role. The new National Early Childhood Development Strategy, the adjustments to the National Health Law to guarantee a front of pack nutrition labelling, and the approval of the Protocol for the Comprehensive Protection of Migrant, Asylum-Seeking and Refugee children, as well as the Model on Alternative Care, to help respect the human rights of child migrants and end their detention, are examples of important successes in which UNICEF in each case teamed up with relevant governmental or non-governmental partners, clearly defined its contribution and value added, and mixed policy and public advocacy to reach the required target audience. The lesson is that if a clear objective is set, a mapping of the key stakeholders undertaken, a selection of the main allies done, and a plan of what UNICEF will bring and with what ingredients (bilateral meetings, OpEds, press releases, technical and/or political letters, participation in strategic working groups, etc), then the probability of success is raised considerably and limited resources are efficiently invested.
As its new programme cycle begins, it is important for UNICEF Mexico to build on the successes and improve the metrics and measuring of success benchmarks to best prioritise its limited resources when it comes to public and policy advocacy. It is not least important because advocacy is the main strategy for achieving results for UNICEF Mexico.
Expansion of UNICEF’s presence 
Learning from the consequences of the 2018 migrant caravans to the office’s operational capacity and its toll on human resources, UNICEF Mexico opened two field offices on the northern and southern borders of Mexico. This has created new dynamics for the office in terms of management: delegation and decentralization of tasks; moving from the classical top-down, direct supervision line to matrix management. This created some confusion in the beginning when it came to delegation of authority and tasking, as well as simple communication between different parts of the main country office towards the field offices. To avoid this in the future, a lesson learned is to develop standard operating procedures that outline programmatic and operational roles, responsibilities and accountabilities prior to the opening of field offices and ensure that these procedures form part of the onboarding procedure for field office staff.

LACR,Nicaragua,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons learned and innovations  
In a sensitive socio-political context, UNICEF used its outreach power to boost innovative partnerships that created new opportunities to promote Children’s rights.  the CO reinforced its leading role in diversified alliances with community organizations, the Global Movement for Children, Universities and the private sector.  This approach allowed us to implement innovative methodologies with a wide range of players. For instance, 147 children, adolescents, parents and judicial facilitators co-designed playful methodological contents to prevent sexual violence and improve a user-friendly access to justice. And 145 professionals from different organizations, as well as children and adolescents learned about the Sports for Development “Partidi” methodology which aims to promote reflection and learning about values such as nonviolence, nondiscrimination, respect, etc while playing football. Also, the involvement of the private sector proved to be crucial to strengthen the skills of 100 young people during the Generation Unlimited Youth Challenge, intended to promote innovation and entrepreneurship among adolescents and youth.
These new partnerships also gave the possibility for UNICEF to establish a more direct contact with communities and to develop pertinent children’s participation initiatives. The alliance with the Global Movement for Children for organizing the 30th anniversary of the CRC, allowed for the voice of 1,041 children and adolescents to be heard through a national consultation. The participation of 30 adolescents with disabilities in this national consultation and in the panel discussion and cultural activities of the central event must be highlighted.
The integration of complementary partners under UNICEF’s umbrella represents an important opportunity that must be fully exploited in the future to progress towards the CP results, especially those aiming at improving community environment.
In addition, UNICEF external communication proved to be crucial for positioning children rights through the traditional media, online and social networks. As shown in the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) below, UNICEF has once again stood out as a leader in this matter in the country:

Leader among the UN System in Nicaragua with more fans and followers in the social networks in Nicaragua.
Media leader against comparative organizations, with more fans and followers on Twitter and second place on Facebook.
Reach in social networks with more than 3,000,000 users throughout the year.
Number of potential impressions in online and print media:32,820,220 and TV and radio: 1,372,705.
Share of voice of all stories on children related issues in broadcast media (TV and radio) measured against comparative organizations:52%, on social media: 42%, and online and print media: 48%.
Percentage of online coverage of UNICEF that is positive: 72%
The estimated publicity (the costs if UNICEF had to buy the publications) was around 900 thousand US dollars.  
This year UNICEF has played a leadership role in institutionalizing communication for development (C4D) as a key cross-cutting issue for achieving programmatic results for children. The baseline, which is expected to be completed at the beginning of 2020, will be crucial to fine tune strategies and to measure results in terms of behavior changes in coming years. During 2019, the following C4D strategies were designed: (i) “Parenting in Values Strategy” that will be implemented by the MoH and the MoFAC. The communication materials have already been designed and printed. In addition, a strategy on immunizations was designed, which will be implemented in 11 municipalities with lower coverage in  the most remote areas of the country; (ii) In partnership with IOM, a digital strategy and community actions were developed for the Prevention of Irregular Migration, aimed at children, adolescents and parents, with emphasis on four municipalities in the South of the country with high migration flow; (iii) together with WFP and PAHO, a comprehensive risk prevention C4D strategy was designed. More than 40 staff members from 17 institutions belonging to SINAPRED were trained on C4D concepts and participated in the entire strategy design process. All strategies will be implemented starting next year.
Besides the achievements described in a previous section, it is important to mention that an evaluation of the volunteering strategy was carried out. It gave the opportunity to draw interesting lessons learned and identify strong opportunities to be developed in the future. The evaluators positively assessed UNICEF Nicaragua’s volunteering strategy and, in their conclusions, defined it as a pertinent, efficient, effective and potentially scalable initiative. They highlighted its contribution to programmatic results in preventing sexual abuse with a strong link and complementarity with C4D interventions. In that regard, they were able to detect behavior changes in children and adolescents who participated in activities implemented by volunteer groups. They also observed that this initiative is forming young change agents who are fully committed with Children’s rights. They recommend exploring how the CO’s volunteering strategy can contribute to other programmatic priorities and strengthen its link with the Generation Unlimited Agenda.
The celebration of the 30th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, in which around 1,041 children and adolescents participated and made their contributions on progress, challenges and opportunities regarding their rights, clearly showed the importance of promoting children and adolescents participation so as their voices are heard.  The Final Joint Declaration mentioned the “enrolment in the school up to the very last girl and boy in Nicaragua” as one of the main challenges they face. They also mentioned as challenges: receiving a quality education, timely access to medicines, more public schools for children with disabilities, while prioritising children in rural areas, and the Caribbean Autonomous Region.
In terms of the UN inter-agency collaboration and promotion of the SDGs, some activities on this regard were carried out; However, further efforts need to be done to better position them in the country’s strategic development agenda. 
The absence of a Resident Coordinator/RC Office since September 2015 did not favor the UN agencies to prepare a joint report to this year’s UPR. A total of 341 recommendations were issued to Nicaragua.
"
LACR,Panama,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Five key innovations accelerated results in 2019 and positioned UNICEF as a local leader for the promotion of children’s rights.
1. Evidence can drive results and ensure we win support for children. 
2019 was marked by the launch of UNICEF’s Situation Analysis on the Rights of Children and Adolescents (SitAn). The SitAn contains novel official data regarding the situation of children and adolescents in Panama in terms of their rights for survival and development, education, protection against violence, living in a clean, safe environment and equal opportunities in life. This is one of the few SitAns in the region having a chapter exclusively dedicated to Children’s Rights and Business Principles. Secondary microdata for several chapters was analyzed in-house and validated by the national government. Internally, the SitAn became the main instrument for planning the next Country Programme Document (CPD) and the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF). However, it also became a strategic tool for raising awareness about children’s rights. The document was widely disseminated with key stakeholders in Panama through a combination of technical publications, videos, animations, interactive experiences, and friendly pocket brochures. Release of the document took place on World’s Children Day, when governmental and private sector partners lit up more than 7 iconic buildings in Panama City to celebrate achievements and prompt society to reflect on the long road still ahead to ensure no child is left behind.
UNICEF will keep using the power of evidence and communication to win support for the cause of children. As it approaches the last year of its current cooperation cycle, programming will continue to be evidence-informed, and planning for the next cycle will be grounded on identified priorities to ensure impact at scale. 
2. Working closely with international financial institutions could accelerate our impact on children’s rights
UNICEF is aiming to work and engage new partners for the cause of children in the country. Countries like Panama, which historically receive loans from different international financial institutions such as the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the World Bank (WB) and the Latin America Development Bank (CAF) among others, are ideal scenarios to build strong public partnerships.
There are different ways to engage with international financial institutions and UNICEF believes that it is key to explore all of them. The range of actions could go from including child-right-sensitive clauses in loan agreements signed by the country, to providing technical assistance to a government needing to implement a loan that comes from one of these financial institutions.
During 2019, UNICEF engaged and cooperated with the IDB in ECD, preprimary education and secondary education (Educación Mesoamérica) initiatives. After this work, it was clear that working together could accelerate results for children.
UNICEF will strength its work with international financial institutions to promote the rights of children, build strong partnerships to advocate together, provide technical assistance to implement their loans, and introduce child-right-sensitive clauses in their loans. 
3. Upstream policy work can and must be combined with local interventions in order to realize the full potential of children’s rights. 
A constant provision of technical assistance in key policy issues and engagement at a downstream level where interventions directly impact the lives of children has proven effective for impactful programming. Given the highly centralized structure of Panamanian institutions, upstream policy work is a necessary dimension of UNICEF Cooperation in a high-income country. Nonetheless, UNICEF also had the capacity to address the migrant crisis in the two significant border zones (Chiriqui and Darien) with supplies and interventions to relieve the situation of a migrant population. A combination of downstream and upstream work continues to prove credible and effective.
However, despite intense advocacy efforts from UNICEF, Panama still does not have a national law for a comprehensive child protection system. Since there was no political consensus on the legislation in President Varela´s administration and having realized that the approval of the law depends heavily on the politics, UNICEF still moved forward with supporting local child protection working groups, and advocacies through a national network of NGOs.  By and large, the high levels of inequality that define social relationships in rural and indigenous territories compel us to refocus attention on sub-national programming as an effective strategy.
UNICEF should discuss with the government the possibility of engaging in different sectors at different levels and regions of the country. One approach could be to target those regions that have relatively strong capacity, but poor social development indicators, since piloting initiatives in those regions could have the best chance of sustainability and impact.
4. Results at scale are only possible when working together.
UNICEF is fully participating in the UN reform process and is influencing the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) to position children’s issues through its capacity to provide significant communication and rigorous monitoring. UNICEF’s SitAn and further inputs into the planning process have strengthened the Common Country Assessment (CCA) and its theory of change. UNICEF regularly leads and takes part in multi-agency interventions, ensuring that children’s rights are considered in UN cooperation.
UNICEF is actively leading and influencing the UN’s CCA and UNSDCF. Therefore, its CPD 2021-2025 will be closely aligned with the UNSDCF and leverage the expertise of other agencies to achieve results at scale.
5. Joint efforts between PFP, Communications and Programme are crucial to harness the power of business and to influence and change the media culture.
UNICEF is implementing diverse approaches to ensure sustainable partnerships with the private sector. A study on Children’s Rights and Business Principles was launched in 2019 and a working group was established to continue discussions on how the private sector can help to guarantee children’s rights in their businesses operations. As part of a strategy for harnessing the power of businesses, UNICEF contributed to a key document produced by the private sector which aims to influence public policies that promote sustainable development. The private sector has also been involved in the planning of the next cooperation cycle 2021-2025. UNICEF has begun a strong advocacy for Family Friendly Policies with the private sector and the B4R approach is being integrated as a key strategy in the next CPD. As for the media, through a partnership with the Latin-American Center for Journalism, UNICEF implemented many activities including training, awards, contests, and a study to influence and change the way the media report on children.  
Joint efforts between the communications team, PFP and programmatic sections were key to produce high-level events that positioned advocacy messages with decision makers, academia, the private sector and NGOs, as well as with the public through media channels.   This strategy set the basis for an integrated communication campaign in 2020 alongside individual fundraising efforts.
"
LACR,Paraguay,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"3. Lessons Learned and Innovations
The implementation of programme activities in 2019 provided key lessons learned and helped identify limitations which will guide the implementation of the 2020-2024 cooperation program.

A key lesson was the need to complement the successful focus on policy advocacy thus far with a more robust presence in prioritized municipalities. This will facilitate the implementation of cros-sectoral demonstration projects, greater efficiency in resource allocation and evidence for replication and scale up of key interventions. This dual approach will be an important component of the 2020-2024 cooperation programme.
Collaboration with the UNICEF´s Business Advisory Council corroborated the growing interest of the private sector in addressing issues that affect children. UNICEF and the Council launched in 2019 the Business Initiative for Early Childhood Development, to be rolled out in 2020. This is a unique opportunity to leverage the private sector value chain to increase the number of children and families that benefit from these interventions.
The systematization of the Family-centered and Safe Maternity (MSCF) model demonstrated the need for better articulation at the first level of care with community engagement to ensure sustainable changes in norms and behavior for prevention, adequate home care and timely care seeking. This will guide technical support to the MSyBS to strengthen primary health care in 2020.
The ongoing articulation of the health and education components in the country programme facilitated the development of integrated strategies for children with disabilities, increasing and improving stimulation and development services, creating community care networks and positioning disability issues. These learnings will be key to the new Cooperation Program´s intersectoral focus.
Greater engagement with civil society was key in advocacy efforts for public policies (i.e. the Adoption Law, Health and Education components). In 2020, national policy advocacy and improvement of government capacities must be complemented by strengthening civil society as a key partner for children´s rights.
Improving the wellbeing of adolescents remains a challenge for the country and UNICEF. Actions to strengthen and expand programs for the integral development of adolescents, including citizen participation, violence prevention, gender equity and employability, are critical and represent a strategic opportunity for technical cooperation, which will be emphasized in 2020.
In communication and advocacy, the use of social networks to promote key messages played an important role, including sustained growth of social media followers and website visits. Strengthening of these platforms will remain vital to promote children´s rights and will be complemented by participatory platforms such as U-report and other communication for development actions in 2020, and to strengthen resource mobilization efforts.
Limitations faced in 2019 also should be considered for the new Cooperation Program starting in 2020.
Despite significant progress in social areas, challenges persist in the development and implementation of public policies that effectively reach the most excluded populations, especially in rural areas. Although the country has substantive legal frameworks, well-developed policies and programs, and a well-conceptualized National Child Protection System, gaps persist in their operationalization and local reach, especially in the articulation of social services. This is compounded by entrenched cultural practices and norms that impact children´s well-being (i.e. widely accepted use of violence as a form of discipline; unequal gender roles).
Leadership changes in public institutions, government´s limited capacity in logistics and infrastructure and UNICEF´s engagement in emergency response impacted the pace of implementation and achievement of certain results. One example is the emergencies caused by heavy floods and by forest fires, which required reorientation resources to support the country´s response to protect families.  In 2020 efforts will be intensified to strengthen the CO´s capacity to respond to emergencies, with an emphasis on preparedness and prevention (including leveraging the emergency and preparedness platform).
Generation of and access to reliable and timely data and evidence for decision-making continues to be a challenge, particularly on children´s issues. UNICEF´s advocacy contributed to reinvigorate the government´s interest in the measurement of issues such as child poverty. External technical assistance will be key to strengthening institutional capacities in this area in 2020.
In 2019 UNICEF implemented several innovations, some of which will carry forward in 2020. UNICEF will strengthen its focus on innovation including the implementation of Innovation Labs in coordination with the UNDP:

The prototype of accessible text in DUA: As part of a global initiative, UNICEF implemented the first experience to produce inclusive texts in the country, in collaboration with technicians from MEC, the SENADIS and the Planning Technical Secretariat (STP). The prototype facilitates the learning of children with visual, auditory, intellectual, motor and psychosocial disabilities, including in Guarani language, taking steps towards compliance with the Marrakesh Treaty ratified in 2017, and the Inclusive Education Law. This process has been recognized for its potential and technical quality and could be expanded through a potential partnership with Google.
Inclusive toys for lifelong learning and stimulation: Stimulation games incorporated a multisensory kit for children with disabilities. This approach strengthened early childhood actions and reinforced the capabilities of service-provision institutions and community agents. In 2019, one of the components of this initiative received a silver prize at the Tatakuá Awards (the country's main creativity contest), in the category of “public welfare campaigns”.
Technology for prevention of online violence: The initiative ´Children and Adolescent, Digital Citizenship and Protection Mechanisms in Situations of Violence´, focused on adolescent-led online engagement for violence prevention, was piloted in local schools with the support of MILLICOM and its local affiliate Tigo. This is a promising innovation to be scaled up in 2020 that has enabled the use of adolescent language to the traditional prevention methods and generated a greater motivation and appropriation of content by adolescents.
In 2020, strategic allianceswill be strengthened to scale up innovative models and interventions, especially with the academic and private sectors and other UN agencies. Initiatives include actions in the health sector to incorporate a training curriculum in early childhood and early stimulation in university education, improvement of access to service availability through an interactive mapping of health care services and innovation labs with UNDP and vulnerable adolescents in local municipalities.
 
"
LACR,Peru,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Challenges that children and adolescents face in Peru are multifaceted and require comprehensive and cross-sectoral government policies and approaches, rather than siloed responses. This is the basis of the current country programme’s Theory of Change, which remains credible and effective for UNICEF’s programming. Three successful experiences from 2019 reflecting this approach, are highlighted below, while UNICEF is well positioned to accelerate results for adolescents.
 
Humanitarian-Development Nexus to address the Venezuelan migration crisis
UNICEF’s effective humanitarian response to the Venezuelan Migration Crisis (L2) in Tumbes (border with Ecuador), with 128,069 people assisted, was followed by timely development responses funded and implemented in northern Lima, where most Venezuelan families have settled. Strong evidence generation (eight research pieces), supported by UNICEF, informed the response at the border and the transition from a humanitarian to a development focus.
UNICEF assisted more than 81,000 children and adolescents at the border, where dialogue and coordination between different sectors and levels of government were key to develop sustainable, rather than ad-hoc, solutions to ensure Venezuelan migrant access to services.  At the same time, UNICEF proactively built a common position on migration – in the framework of the current UNDAF, going beyond the humanitarian response – with key messages around: advocacy to regularize the immigration status of all migrants, providing technical assistance to expand basic services to all, and public campaigning to highlight the economic opportunity of migration and prevent discrimination.
 
Ministry of Education’s leadership to address Violence against Children (VAC) 
While UNICEF has long worked closely with the Ministry of Women and Vulnerable Populations (MIMP) to address violence against children, in 2019 UNICEF also worked strategically with the Ministry of Education (MoE) to make a bigger impact. With UNICEF’s support, the MoE led three key VAC prevention initiatives:

An innovative National Survey on School Climate and Violence (ENCEVE), piloted in 9 regions, reaching 108 schools and 4975 students, and ready for national expansion.
The development of a ‘positive discipline and socio-affective skills model’ to improve school climate and foster positive teaching practices. The model, aligned with INSPIRE: Seven strategies for Ending Violence Against Children, is linked to the National School Curriculum. Clear guidelines for principals on handling cases of violence reached nearly 20 per cent of schools (6,387 out of 34,866 public schools).
The launch of the communication campaign ‘Brigada SiseVe’ (‘Yes, you can see it’ Brigade) to prevent violence in schools and encourage reporting of violence through an MoE-established mechanism.
 
The MoE’s leadership was also key to co-host, with MIMP, a high-level event to develop a roadmap for a National Plan of Action to End Violence against Children 2020-2030, as a part of the Global Pathfinder initiative. This effort was complemented by a UNICEF communication campaign launched during the Pan Am Games (reaching 2 million on social media), to raise the profile of VAC – in a country particularly focused on violence against women – in public debate.
These milestones demonstrate the importance of working with more than one sector, combining multiple strategies – including evidence generation, model development, policy dialogue and communication campaigns – to develop scalable approaches to address VAC.
 
An integrated approach to Early Childhood Development, boosted by UNICEF
UNICEF’s longstanding investment in policy dialogue, evidence generation, capacity building and support to intersectoral governance on Early Childhood Development (ECD) has contributed to the development of the National ‘Childhood First’ Policy launched December 2019, and the design of the ECD Results-Based Budget Programme (RBBP), two stepping-stones towards increasing coverage and quality of services and achieving greater efficiency and effectiveness in public spending.
UNICEF-led initiatives at the sub-national level contributed to improving quality of services, increased budget allocation (i.e 58 per cent in Ucayali region), strengthened 17 intersectoral coordination spaces, and served as a model to design and implement national ECD policies and governance systems.
UNICEF helped generate a critical mass of ECD ‘champions’ to build momentum on expansion of ECD policies. The private sector and media were key allies to reach families and communities at scale. On the CRC’s 30th anniversary, 30 CEOs came together to express their interest in implementing or supporting ECD interventions; a regional alliance between UNICEF and Kimberley Clark was launched, mobilizing influencers; the media company Radio Programas del Perú (RPP) ran the ECD campaign “What you do now lasts their whole lives”, and journalists participated in disseminating parenting skills. Six videos on parenting were translated into Quechua and Shipibo and disseminated in three subnational regions, reaching 64,259 video plays.
 
Looking forward: Accelerating results for adolescents
UNICEF has been working relentlessly to place adolescents at the centre of the public policy agenda through policy dialogue, advocacy, technical assistance and evidence generation, contributing to improved regulatory frameworks in the education and health sectors. Demonstrative education models and expanded adolescent participation opportunities were developed, with gender equality and intercultural approaches.
However, the full potential of adolescents is far from being recognized in public policies. Expanding opportunities for adolescents requires not just generating evidence and technical guidance to improve policies and services, but also transforming adult perceptions of adolescents, and listening to adolescent voices to make services more relevant and effective.
The 30th CRC anniversary was a great opportunity to put adolescents, and their right to participation, in the public debate through partnerships and advocacy with government, private sector, media, and civil society. UNICEF has also engaged influencers by appointing two young ambassadors.
Today, UNICEF is recognized as an authority on adolescent rights and is well positioned to influence public policies, with wide expertise gained at the national and regional/local levels. A strong compact is needed to accelerate results for adolescents, combining robust public policies and improved services, private sector and media partnerships, social mobilization and full participation of adolescents. UNICEF’s experience in boosting integrated ECD policies – though not a cookie cutter approach, given differing contexts, challenges and opportunities – could inspire the way to ensuring adolescents have equal opportunities to reach their full potential in Peru.

LACR,Uruguay,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Some of the lessons learned were discussed during the Strategic Moment of Reflection in preparation of the next CPD. They included the fact that the positive image of UNICEF has allowed the Office to position the agenda relating to children’s rights in political discussions. UNICEF is frequently invited to parliament to offer opinions on child-related legislation and has become a reference point for knowledge on the situation of children in Uruguay. Importantly, given its size and its political and institutional stability, Uruguay has the potential to become an interventions lab, testing models and scaling them up and to have an influence on making a difference in the lives of children beyond the country’s borders.
An ongoing study on the added value of UNICEF’s cooperation, conducted by UNICEF and the office of international cooperation of the Presidency AUCI, has produced preliminary results. These shed a light on what decision-makers and other qualified respondents find are UNICEF’s added value in Uruguay.  Findings include UNICEF promoting new approaches and coming up with new solutions to persistent problems affecting children; producing evidence leading to questions on the culturally accepted practices of physical and psychological punishment; being more able than others to raise awareness of children’s issues because UNICEF is well trusted and because of its communication strategies; being able to mobilize key actors; and having the capacity to go beyond ‘business as usual’ through innovation, new models and well-tested international experience to bring new approaches to stubborn challenges.
This was a significant year marked by the presidential and parliamentary elections.  Following 15 consecutive years of the Frente Amplio in power, the presidential candidate from the National Party won the elections, supported by a coalition of other parties.  UNICEF managed to get all candidates with parliamentary representation committed to the children’s agenda. 
 
Innovation
This year was marked by innovation in the Office: for the first time UNICEF, in alliance with the British Embassy, signed an MoU with the Ministry of Defence to prepare a national sustainable policy to ensure that Uruguayan peacekeepers will become child protection champions in peacekeeping missions. In addition, UNICEF and the Universidad de la República are working on research on children’s issues aiming to bring academia and policy makers together. UNICEF also launched the GEN-U challenge, a very useful way to reinvigorate UNICEF’s work on adolescents.  UNICEF updated the online platform, DerechosDeEstudiantes.edu.uy  to improve usability, interface and design. The platform allows students to make school-related inquiries and safely and anonymously denounce harassment, bullying and abuse.
The Office also embarked on an innovative process, applying a ""Design Thinking"" methodology, to find potential solutions to the different challenges faced by migrant children and their families when settling in Uruguay. This will be fed into the new CPD. To strengthen team spirit, the whole Office (including Operations, Programmes, Communications and PFP staff) along with the start-up Socialab, took part in four workshops and came up with several ideas that UNICEF will implement in the coming years.
Team spirit: Integrated Campaigns
The ‘integrated campaign’ concept combining programmes, communications and fundraising is a useful approach. It is in line with international research on enhancing the effectiveness of diverse teams as well as being a key strategy of UNICEF’s global (PFP) ‘Supporter Engagement Strategy’.  A good example was the ‘Cooking for Them Today Lasts Forever’ campaign.  The campaign showed that the ‘value exchange’ approach resulted in a win-win situation for fundraising and programmes. During the campaign, using evidence-based messaging, UNICEF not only asked people to help children, but also offered them ways to help improve the situations of families. The office identified that the most successful integrated campaigns are those where information is provided to families (‘value exchange’) and when people are asked not only to give funds but also to help families with tools. New pledge donors generated through these campaigns stay longer with UNICEF than other donors. The campaign led to 17,000 new potential pledge donors.
As mentioned above, during 2019, UNICEF Chile and UNICEF Uruguay supported SENAME and INAU in a South-South cooperation project aimed at finding solutions to deinstitutionalize children in residential care institutions.  This was also one of the commitments signed by the Presidential candidates.  According to the main newspaper El Pais in its edition of December 10th, deinstitutionalization will be one of the priorities of the newly elected President and his Ministry of Social Development.

Finally, since the opening of the Office, UNICEF has not conducted any evaluation. The Office is, therefore, currently carrying out three independent evaluations.
 
Challenges
Since 2014, UNICEF has supported the education authorities to develop an inclusive education model for primary schools, the Mandela network.  Although the CPD target of the number of inclusive schools has been reached and exceeded (the Network grew from 10 in 2014 to 80 public schools across the country in 2019), there are still 79 special primary schools only for children with disabilities, including one for children with physical and mental disabilities and one for children with emotional disabilities (i.e. children with social adaptation issues).  The number of these special schools has remained the same since 2010.  Enrolment in special schools has decreased slightly from 2,66% out of the total enrolment in primary schools in 2011, to a 2,45% in 2018 - (https://www.anep.edu.uy/monitor/servlet/portada).  There is no information on the situation of adolescents with disabilities attending secondary education.
The evaluation of the Mandela network in 2020 will shed light on the next steps. Looking to the future, UNICEF will open dialogue with all actors working on inclusive education in order to design a comprehensive strategy targeting a universal policy for inclusive education in Uruguay.
During its current programme, UNICEF worked to strengthen the Uruguay’s child protection system to prevent and address violence against children. As of 2019, with UNICEF support, the Ministry of Public Health, primary education, secondary education and the Institute for Children and Adolescents (INAU) all have official protocols to detect and address violence against children. The System of Special Protection against Violence (SIPIAV) has significantly increased its capacity to detect and address situations of violence and sexual abuse against children and adolescents: case detention numbers rose from 800 children in 2011 to more than 3,150 in 2018.

However, the level of violence is still very high as described in Section 1 of this report. UNICEF has responsibility to support national efforts to develop new strategies to modify social norms and cultural patterns that enable violence. These strategies will move from a gender-blind approach focusing solely on the detection and reparation of situations of violence to an approach that emphasizes prevention and applies a gender perspective.

To that end, UNICEF and its partners face two main challenges: to design bold strategies aimed at modifying violent parenting practices; and to develop inter-sectoral policy actions to change gender norms that enable violence against women and children.  In Uruguay, despite evidence showing that 20% of children live in homes where women are victims of violence by their partner[1] and 42% of victims of femicide had children[2], prevention and care policies are fragmented and do not instigate action. Making inter-sectoral actions visible and developing policies that comprehensively articulate and address gender-based violence against women and children will be one of the main objectives of UNICEF in Uruguay.

LACR,Venezuela,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF’s 2019 main drivers of results have been the continued dialogue with national and local authorities, and other stakeholders; the capacity to leverage humanitarian space opened by the HNO and HRP process, as the humanitarian architecture put in place; the activation of UNICEF’s Level 2 support mechanisms, the expansion of the field presence, and agile programming.
All along 2019, UNICEF faced a fluid and ever evolving context that forced the organization to adjust its operational resilience and relevancy by responding rapidly to information provided by internal feedback mechanisms and interactions with key stakeholders; leveraging any opportunity and venturing into new approaches to deliver better and more for children in a resource stringent environment; upholding core humanitarian principles and core commitments for children in emergency as the main drivers of the humanitarian response.
As a result, despite a highly politicized environment, UNICEF has built and maintained good, impartial and neutral relations with all stakeholders, including Government entities, opposition groups, donors and NGOs, which have translated into agreements with decision-makers to streamline programmatic work, swift expansion of interventions across the country, continuous donor support although not at the scale needed and, no limitation on humanitarian access. Additionally, UNICEF has aligned its priorities with those of other partners and factored in feedback from beneficiaries which have proven to be an effective approach to robust implementation, mobilization of local support and, creation of the level of trust needed for community ownership and acceptance of services provided by UNICEF and its partners.
Discrete influencing at national level with focused networking at local level, combined with enhanced field presence, integrated cross-sectoral planning and response to child needs, robust monitoring systems, reinforced internal program and operations management capacity and, relationship building with all actors at all levels have shown to be winning strategies to: (a) build a trustworthy working environment; (b) establish the necessary proximity required to obtain premium information for programming; (c) trigger behavior change needed to maximize the impact of interventions; (d) leverage coordination for an effective and efficient response;  (e) engage donor’s based on human interest stories and facts and figures that best described the realities faced by children; (f) redirect UNICEF’s attention and efforts to narrow neglected or silent unmet needs such as school feeding, pediatric HIV-AIDS or specific protection needs of children from minority groups; and, (g) nurture the critical buy-in of all stakeholders needed to ensure routine access to children in need.
To maximize the resources dedicated to life-saving intervention in a context marked by a vast range of diverse needs scattered across the country, the attitude of the ruling Government regarding humanitarian assistance, the challenge to mobilize resources, and a set of operational constraints (energy, fuel, in-country suppliers), UNICEF has adopted a two-fold strategic posture, namely, an integrated and decentralized approach that links the different sectoral components of its program (water, sanitation, hygiene, education, protection, nutrition and health) and a capacity-building effort that internally focused on mobilizing additional leadership, managerial and technical expertise, while leveraging the capacity of the State without providing direct funding to government institutions, promoting knowledge acquisition for care givers, broadening partnership, procuring and distributing critical supplies and renovating infrastructure. 
As a way forward, UNICEF in Venezuela will continue its effort to leverage all resources available inside and outside the country to meet the needs of mothers and children, reinforce its current investment in accountability for resources and results, and advocate for the respect of the rights of the child of Venezuela living inside, on the move or settled outside the country.

MENAR,Algeria,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Important lessons were learned from the MTR of the 2016–2020 country programme. Drawn from the experience gained so far from programme implementation between 2016 and 2019, these lessons learned will inform the remaining period of the programme cycle.
The availability of up-to-date data and indicators for children in Algeria remains a constraint for assessing the country’s progresses and UNICEF interventions. While the existence of large data gaps is a fact, an important lesson learned has been the need to better use data from MICS and other existing good quality national sources for effective policy advocacy and communication efforts.  Certain opportunities are lost by not capitalizing on the previous cycles of MICS and rich evidence generated so far. To address these challenges, UNICEF will intensify its support to MoH and other partners in terms of capacity building in data analysis and in various approaches to data dissemination across different audiences. Meanwhile, UNICEF is currently preparing a brief data diagnostic that will serve as basis for Data for Children action plan and contribute to improving the data culture. It is also planned to develop a guide of the ongoing MICS 6 to capitalize the experience gained in the training, the fieldwork and the quality review process. 
At the same time, there are some good examples of capacity building in terms of evidence generation, particularly in the social inclusion area. The actual use made by Algeria in its first Voluntary National Report of the results from the child and youth multidimensional poverty analysis conducted by the CNES stands out as a positive outcome from the steady investment made by UNICEF in capacity building and advocacy for innovative solutions to address children and youth vulnerability.
UNICEF continued to strengthen partnerships with its main government counterparts, other UN agencies, CSOs and academia to accelerate results for children. Despite the prevailing political context in 2019, capacity building efforts helped to revitalize partnerships with line ministries such as MoE and MoNS. Indeed, in the context of the SDGs, strengthening national systems through the application of RBM for inclusive social development was relevant. The initial series of RBM training was instrumental in deepening UNICEF understanding of institutional needs and capacities and in turn, MoE and MoNS understanding of the UNICEF programming approach and procedures.
Another important lesson learned was the need to further strengthen UNICEF work within the UN joint SDG programme. The SDG framework was used to leverage social inclusion of children and youth thanks to a substantive collaboration with the UN SDG task force and the government SDG steering committee. A key contribution was made on monitoring the SDG 1 related to child poverty and social protection. In addition, active participation during the preparation of the all-partners workshop in SDG 3 on good health and well-being and SDG 5 on gender equality and female empowerment carries promises for enhanced convergence, as well as improved systems and policies to achieve the SDGs.
An additional lesson learned was the opportunity of working with CSOs in adolescent and youth participation on matters that impact their lives and the life of their communities. Thanks to the recent partnership with SMA, UNICEF is in a better position to promote the integration of the LSCE approach and contribute to moving forward mechanisms for actual participation of adolescents and youth.
A major finding from the MTR is that C4D has been so far poorly mobilized, except limited interventions in key parenting and community practices in support to ECD interventions. C4D interventions played a key role in supporting programme results in terms of leveraging community and mass media platforms (radio, national television), local authorities and academia. With simultaneous involvement of External Communication and C4D teams, UNICEF Algeria is learning about the importance of fully integrating its approach to communication.
Since the onset of the current country programme, UNICEF has been supporting innovation by using technology, following different streams and working with different partners.  UNICEF Algeria has supported an Innovation Lab since 2014 with the Ecole Nationale Supérieure d'Informatique (ESI). It has come clear that innovative digital solutions developed by students for children, parents and other rights holders should be reviewed and the partnership assessed so that its potential for results can be better realized. Indeed the experience built with ESI would be enhanced from making it converge with other initiatives and partnerships like the GenU Youth Challenge 2.0. under development with SMA and UNDP.

MENAR,Djibouti,Lessons Learned and Innovations," 
-       En matière de leçons apprises, 2019 a vu la mise en place de systèmes de suivi en temps réel des interventions appuyées par l’UNICEF auprès des institutions gouvernementales et communautaires qui a amélioré considérablement la réaction rapide de l’UNICEF mais aussi du Gouvernement en opérant des ajustements nécessaires à temps. Ce système a permis l’amélioration du suivi de l’exécution des activités, a accru la redevabilité des institutions vis à vis des services rendu à la population et amélioré d’une manière générale la planification et l’obtention des données de qualité. 
-       Aussi l’intégration des partenaires de mise en œuvre des programmes de la société dans les résultats sectoriels a constitué une leçon apprise. En effet l’ouverture du gouvernement à reconnaitre et prendre en considération capacités d’exécution des partenaires non-gouvernementaux a eu un impact certain sur la vue d’ensemble des interventions sectorielles et donc leurs exactitudes dans la planification mais aussi sur le rapportage des résultats notamment en matière des couvertures. Cette ouverture a conforté les secteurs qui l’ont accepté dans leur rôle de régulateur du secteur sur le plan normatif, de supervision et contrôle qualité de toutes les interventions sectorielles. Ça été le cas dans le secteur de l’eau, l’Assainissement et l’Hygiène où le Ministère de l’agriculture a entrepris de consulter toutes les parties prenantes afin de s’assurer de leur alignement sur les objectifs nationaux et avoir un contrôle technique sur leurs réalisations mais aussi s’approprier les résultats atteints par leurs interventions. Cela a été aussi le cas du Ministère de l’éducation nationale qui a intégré depuis un certain temps tous les intervenants dans le plan d’action de l’Éducation.
-       Enfin la nécessité de s’engager dans une logique de préparation de plans de contingence et d’approche de réduction de risque de catastrophes  avec le gouvernement pour être en mesure de faire face aux intempéries/inondations récurrentes et éviter que les mêmes structures soient à chaque fois touchées est autre leçon apprise de l’année. La section Eau, Assainissement et Hygiène  qui avait préparé un plan de contingence du secteur a su répondre à temps même si le secteur est soumis aux mêmes difficultés de coordination qui prévaut dans le pays. Dans cette situation il est nécessaire pour l’UNICEF de s’engager au moins avec ses partenaires de mise en œuvre dans la logique de préparation à l’urgence.
Les principaux défis sont les suivants :
-       Malgré les progrès en 2019 dans la conduite d’enquêtes thématiques sur la malnutrition et les MGF, l’absence de données d’enquête à jour sur les indicateurs clés de la situation des enfants depuis 2012 continue à poser un défi pour le suivi des progrès vers l’atteinte des ODD et les autres objectifs nationaux de développement, pour l’évaluation des différents programmes mis en œuvre et pour la planification basée sur les évidences en général. Les systèmes administratifs produisent des données de qualité variable qui ne sont pas systématiquement partagées en temps opportun. Etant donné que la conduite d’enquêtes thématiques ne représente pas généralement un bon rapport cout-efficacité, vu la taille des échantillons nécessaires pour produire des données représentatives au niveau national, la nécessité de conduire dans les meilleurs délais une enquête transversale de type MICS/EDS s’impose (la dernière enquête de ce type remonte à 2012). En 2020, l’UNICEF fera un plaidoyer et proposera son assistance technique pour mener une enquête MICS et les différents programmes continueront à appuyer les systèmes d’information sectoriels afin de renforcer la qualité et la complétude des données ainsi que les capacités d’analyse de données au niveau des partenaires.
-       Le deuxième défi concerne les mécanismes de coordination sectoriels dont la faiblesse continue à poser un obstacle à une programmation coordonnée entre les différents acteurs. Bien qu’un certains nombre de mécanismes existent au niveau conceptuel, ils ne sont pas fonctionnels dans la majorité des secteurs, avec les exceptions notables de l’éducation et de la protection sociale et de façon embryonnaire dans le secteur WASH. Par conséquent, les actions des différents intervenants gouvernementaux et des partenaires techniques et financiers souffrent parfois d’un manque de coordination et il y a un risque réel de duplication des actions, notamment dans les secteurs ou domaines qui attirent l’intérêt de beaucoup d’acteurs ou des financements conséquents. En outre, l’absence de mécanismes de coordination entraine dans certains secteurs ou sous-secteurs un vide ou un manque de clarté en termes de leadership sur des thématiques données, y compris sur les rôles et mandats des Agences du système des Nations Unies. En réponse à cette situation l’UNICEF continuera en 2020 à participer activement aux groupes sectoriels qui existent et à plaider sous le leadership de la Coordinatrice Résidente pour l’établissement des autres groupes de coordination.
-       En matière d’innovation, le bureau a développé plusieurs initiatives qui ont permis de mener les interventions au profit des femmes et enfants vulnérables d’une manière différente. En effet incontestablement l’introduction de Data For Action a été l’innovation technologique qui a complètement changé la façon de travailler avec le partenaire de mise en œuvre et de percevoir rapidement des changements importants. Aussi le travail mené auprès des jeunes bloggers a permis de toucher de manière substantielle les cibles du programme de coopération notamment les adolescents et jeunes. Courant 2019 le bureau a noué un nouveau partenariat avec le Centre Technologique d’Information et Développement  qui a permis d’organiser le premier forum des adolescents et jeunes dans le monde arabe. Dans le domaine de l’éducation le projet de sac solaire en faveur des élèves scolarisés en milieu rural pour favoriser leur apprentissage durant la nuit a constitué une autre initiative que le bureau a mené.
-       Cependant si certaines de ces initiatives comme le D4A ont fait la différence, elles ne sont pas toujours évidentes à mettre en œuvre. En effet malgré l’engouement des jeunes pour le réseaux sociaux l’accès physique et financier de ces jeunes à l’internet reste une grande barrière. Aussi la disponibilité du marché intérieur pour confectionner les sacs solaires de qualité à un prix accessible constitue un goulot d’étranglement qui peut être difficilement levé.
"
MENAR,Egypt,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"This paragraph outlines two interventions employing innovative approaches to overcome specific challenges faced by the programme. The first intervention is related to the provision of child protection services to refugees and migrants living in host communities. The second intervention focuses on tackling practices harmful to children in a context of entrenched gender-related social norms constraining progress in key child protection areas.
.
3.1 Delivering child protection services through the public health system: a model for reaching children in need 
The provision of child protection (CP) services to migrants and refugees poses major challenges; the fact that refugees live within local communities, rather than in camps, makes it difficult to locate them. The limited availability in the country of social work force for the provision of CP services is also a constraining factor.
In an attempt to overcome these challenges, UNICEF in partnership with the MoHP, designed an intervention that uses the Primary Health Units (PHUs) as an entry point for the provision of CP services to migrants, refugees and host communities.
The intervention began in 2017 in 40 PHUs where capacity of health personnel and community volunteers was developed to provide psycho-social support and other services to children and parents. A needs assessment conducted in 2018 showed that beneficiaries required additional services. Accordingly, the array of services provided was expanded to include positive parenting sessions, recreational programmes, life skills training, case management and specialised services to children with disabilities, among other services.
The implementation of the intervention has proved effective in overcoming the contextual challenges. Since all children in Egypt, irrespective of their nationality, are entitled to free vaccinations and other basic health services in the PHUs, migrant and refugee families often approach the PHUs. This makes the PHUs an effective point to reach migrants, which would otherwise be difficult to locate within the communities where they live.   
Since the PHUs are government institutions, they do not require security clearance; this significantly facilitate the intervention, as civil society organizations are required to obtain security clearance to receive foreign funding and implement interventions. Another element that has proven important for the model’s success is the presence of PHUs throughout the country and the proximity to the communities. The model has also demonstrated to be effective in reducing operating costs as it relies on MoHP’s structure and personnel.
Building on the successful experience, the model was expanded in 2019 to 80 PHUs across 19 governorates. UNICEF is working with MoHP to expand the coverage to additional districts and progressively reach all the country’s governorates, within the context of the national health system transformative agenda. For a summary of the results achieved through this model, refer to paragraph 2.6.
3.2 Dawwie: innovative programming to create an ecosystem that empowers girls and contributes to tackling harmful societal practices
Egypt faces a high prevalence of harmful practices such as FGM and gender disparities. UNICEF supported NCCM in the design and implementation of a national girls’ empowerment initiative, called Dawwie. The initiative has a distinctive innovative feature as, rather than attempting to address the specific practices harmful to children, it aims at tackling gender inequality as a root cause of such practices, thus contributing to establish the foundations of a long-term gender norms transformation.
The programme recognises that individual behaviors have complex and interconnected determinants and aims at creating a conducive ecosystem to tackle harmful social norms by building a community of institutions and people in supporting girls to fulfill their full potential. Based on the Organized Diffusion of Innovation theory, Dawwie employs social marketing, community dialogue and media advocacy techniques to engaging individuals, communities, and policymakers. Conceptualised to empower boys and girls, the initiative builds on storytelling to connect children and adolescents with communities and policymakers in addition to enhancing institutional support to foster children’s and adolescents’ access to services, skills, and information contributing to gender equality. Based on a mix of interventions that goes from individual and community level to digital and media engagement, the programme focuses on giving visibility to the voices of girls and boys at individual and community levels to facilitate a change in social expectations, through interactive community theater, intergenerational dialogues, digital platforms, edutainment, campaigning, etc.
Two elements of the programme that have proved crucial for its success are the national participatory branding strategy and the open-source toolkits. Together they were instrumental in ensuring a strong organic replicability and scalability allowing institutions and groups such as ministries, schools, NGOs, civil society organisations and individuals to start their own localised Dawwie-branded activities. The Initiative’s innovative model and design feature has allowed it to effectively adapt itself to the Egyptian context. The initiative has strong institutional support, with six ministries, two national councils, civil society, national and international organizations actively involved in its implementation.
In 2019, UNICEF supported training of 5,000 youth on digital literacy, engaged 7,000 youth through Dawwie storytelling Circles and Road Show community engagement as positive gender socialisation opportunity for the most vulnerable. In addition, Dawwie had a reach of 2 million on social media (with 8% engagement rate). Formally endorsed by the Minister of Education, the rollout of Dawwie package in schools organically reached 33,732 girls, 12,968 boys and 4,877 parents in 3,603 schools in just the last quarter of 2019. 
Dawwie's inception phase showed that investment in building a coalition of supporters involved in the initiative’s design was crucial in ensuring ownership and commitment in organically implementing activities thus promoting sustainability and high return of investment.
Capitalising on the initiative’s rapid and organic expansion, the Government and UNICEF will support the strengthening of Dawwie’s coordination mechanisms to further promote the organic expansion of the programme. This will include setting up a national monitoring and evaluation systems to assess the programme impact on changing social expectations as well as behaviors harmful to children, especially girls.
"
MENAR,Iran,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Improved Efficiency in Flood Response. The floods revealed important gaps in emergency management capacity. This situation slowed appropriate responses to the education needs of affected areas. UNICEF proposed creating a task force on Disaster Risk Reduction in the Ministry to address Education in Emergency issues.
UNICEF identified pre-positioning of immediate emergency response items for the first 72 hours as a preparation measure to prevent facing significant delays. Furthermore, UNICEF initiated development of a mechanism with each partner to simplify the process of receiving emergency requests with technical specifications to reduce/prevent the delays.
Innovating as we navigated the challenges posed by sanctions. UNICEF faced unforeseen challenges for procurement of emergency supplies, leading to delays in identification and contracting suppliers and shipping companies to work with Iran. In full coordination with RO and HQ, UNICEF identified new supply and shipping paths in the region to solve this issue and to mitigate risks.
Facing constraints in programme implementation. Due to the flood emergency, MOHME’s previous priorities of health in UNICEF’s programmes shifted and led to delays in the signature of the bilateral work plans. Furthermore, UNICEF faced some challenges, such as delays in custom clearance of procured items and the halt in the neonatal investment case. UNICEF continues to advocate at high level with MOHME for timely implementation of what has been jointly agreed.
Our work on adolescents remains sensitive, and access to related data is challenging.
Meanwhile changes in the structure of the Ministry of Education, including integration of some offices as well as new senior appointments, coupled with uncertainties in the socio-political context of the country, slowed planning and implementing joint activities with MoE.
Management changes within the government partners constrained implementation of joint activities and formalizing of a key partnership that can enable UNICEF to place children at heart of planning and budgeting. UNICEF continues to promote evaluation culture and the positive steps taken during the reporting period to endorse the terms of reference of the NIDCAP evaluation through a formal steering committee.
Harnessing Emerging Opportunities. Consultations are ongoing to increase the number of AWBCs and integrate them into the national strategic programme. MoHME is considering the pilot implementation of boarding AWBCs in Tehran (girls) and Kermanshah (boys). UNICEF’s technical role in the field of adolescence has been acknowledged as critical, including in supporting the provision of latest adolescence knowledge for national technical staff and tailor-made interventions for adolescents with specific needs and characteristics.
Resuming partnership with the NBCRC represents a strategic opportunity for UNICEF to advocate for child rights. Supporting NBCRC provincial bodies’ work will be important.
While UNICEF supported the MCLSW to operationalize multi-dimensional poverty measurement, we need to advocate and liaise more to bridge the coordination gaps between different line ministries.
Partnership with Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance on media advocacy for children was a success, thus providing a unique opportunity to use national art and cultural events to advocate for children’s issues. This partnership needs to be nurtured.
The SitAn on child maltreatment and mapping of existing systems/services in 4 targeted provinces created a platform for multi-sector cooperation among government and UN. This provides a valuable foundation for longer-term coordination among relevant stakeholders in this area, including for development of multi-sector policy guidance on prevention of child maltreatment.
Provision of case management and Community-Based Child Protection services in emergencies are two initiatives, recently introduced in the national CPiE response interventions with UNICEF support, that have been an initial success. Further technical consultations are required to assess the findings and review necessary coordination mechanisms.
Following the MENA Regional Health and Nutrition Network meeting which was held in Tehran in June - where over 60 participants from UNICEF MENA Country Offices, the Regional Office and Headquarters gathered to discuss and exchange their experiences on the integrated approach for programming for Goal Area 1 of the UNICEF Strategic Plan 2018-2021, UNICEF Iran is pursuing a number of requests for South-South cooperation on Primary Health Care.
UNICEF and the Vice-Presidency for Science and Technology signed a partnership on Innovations for children in Iran. UNICEF showcased innovations for children in INOTEX 2019 and awarded the best innovative ideas by adolescents. UNICEF Iran Innovation Package was developed and shared with Pardis Technology Park (PTP). UNICEF is briefing Iran’s startup ecosystem on its Innovation Initiative. The Office has facilitated participation of Iranian startups in the Global Innovation Fund. There efforts will be further pursued.
Through UNICEF advocacy, all municipalities in Iran are now committed to the CFCI with established CFCI councils and secretariats in 25 municipalities. Several cities are selected to pilot CFCI in 2020-2021 for the UNICEF CFCI Candidacy.
With the support of the European Union, in 2019 UNICEF continued to build resilient inclusive systems that better address the needs and protect the rights of most vulnerable children living in Iran, including Afghan refugee children. The economic crisis and volatility associated with sanctions is stressing the country’s social protection policies, with increasing demands and constrained public resources. It is therefore critical for UNICEF to continuously advocate and work with partners for dedicated public finance for children across sectors and help accelerate reforms towards streamlined inclusive and adaptive social protection programs to minimize the long-term consequences from the current economic downturn.
As a result of the MTR, UNICEF is committed to moving the needle in the identified tangible programmatic areas and demonstrating proof of concept on results for children at the provincial-level. UNICEF is also committed to ensure that the human resource structure of the office is fit for purpose in technical areas, such as public financing for children, emergency preparedness and addressing the impact of sanctions on vulnerable children.
 
 
"
MENAR,Iraq,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In 2019 UNICEF built on the comparative stability in Iraq to streamline partnerships and processes, consolidate gains, identify areas for improvement in 2020 and beyond, and identify joint UN programming opportunities under the upcoming UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (SDCF).
As in previous years, prolonged political uncertainty continued with several key UNICEF counterpart line Ministries, such as Education, remaining without a Minister until well into 2019. Timeframes for UNICEF interventions had to be lengthened to allow newly-formed governments at federal and Kurdistan levels to become active. Mass civil protests from October 2019 led to the resignation of the federal Cabinet; and, as of end-2019, UNICEF anticipates similar political uncertainty in 2020. To some degree, UNICEF has been able to mitigate delays by focusing on relationship-building and coordination at decentralized levels with Governors or Directors-General. This has proven effective, although there remain areas - for example Ninewa where in 2019 three Education Directors-General were in post - where even decentralized efforts were slow. UNICEF continued targeted capacity development interventions for technical government staff, to support Government constitutional provisions towards decentralization of administrative and financial authorities (Articles 121 and 122) as well as enhance local authority service delivery capacities in line with good practices and international standards.
In 2019, UNICEF increased life course- and convergence-focused programming. Parenting skills programmes, delivered by Child Protection Sub-Cluster and government social workers, worked to increase parents and caregivers’ knowledge of positive discipline techniques, increase inter-generational communication, and contribute to reducing violence against children and women in the home; trainings for teachers and education staff focused on pedagogical skills to reduce corporal punishment, enhance learner-centered approaches, and improve school staff’s ability to identify, manage, and refer children who are experiencing psychosocial distress or child protection issues at school or at home. Iraqi young people’s energy for social change has been a driving force; in 2019; in UNICEF-supported programmes, youth groups have delivered key health, hygiene, and ‘Back to School’ messaging in multiple parts of the country, as well as engaging through social media, such as Facebook, and through the newly-rolled out ‘U-Report’ platform that amplifies young people’s voices and supports them to engage on civic issues
U-Report is one example of an innovative platform newly-introduced to Iraq in 2019. Further examples include pilot efforts to use mobile data to triangulate and validate measures of child poverty – the final report is available, and technical consultation with government partners took place in Oxford, U.K., in late 2019, as part of overall efforts to improve understanding of, and capacities to address, multi-dimensional child poverty through application of technology. Digitalization of Iraq’s water laboratory system has been ongoing in 2019, alongside installation of ‘smart’ water meters that are now supporting an estimated 9,500 users in Baghdad to access real-time information about their water use and water losses.
Recent years’ newly-generated evidence continues to bolster UNICEF work in Iraq. In addition to the MICS-VI (2018), which helped inform 2019 programming and 2024 to 2024 planning, in 2018 a pilot Community Based Reintegration Strategy (CBRS) was designed based on evidence from a ‘Push and Pull Factors’ study (2017) on child recruitment by armed groups. The pilot took place in two districts where recruitment had been found to be high, and completed in April 2019; in late 2019, UNICEF noted all 100 boys (project participants) previously associated with armed actors remained disengaged (100 per cent), indicating the evidence-informed design had been relevant and effective. Evidence on multi-dimensional child poverty continued to pave the way for stronger child-focused government engagement including via the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS). Gender-sensitive programming was supported by a Gender Programmatic Review (GPR) in late December 2018. The GPR detailed recommendations by sector, which UNICEF is taking forward to improve alignment with, and contribution to, the GAP.
Funding constraints remained for Syrian refugee response, similarly to previous years; UNICEF adapted programming strategies to work through government partners wherever possible, supporting more cost-effective programming and systems-building as part of humanitarian-development nexus efforts. UNICEF continued to advocate with resource partners for funding based on vulnerability, rather than specific populations, and appreciates key resource partners, such as Germany, who have agreed that Syrian refuge and IDP children can be supported through its funding, as well as flexible multi-year contributions from the Government of Denmark and via UNICEF National Committees from Germany, Switzerland, and France under global thematic Humanitarian, Education, Child Protection, and WASH funding pools. UNICEF Iraq WASH programming was subject to a dedicated Humanitarian Action Review (HAR) in September 2019, in coordination with government, led by UNICEF and Global WASH Cluster experts. The HAR reviewed quality of WASH programming and coordination following recent years’ response to large-scale and complex emergency. The team produced several recommendations; one key and timely observation was related to transition from Cluster coordination to a more sustainable sector-led mechanism – this is already underway in certain locations, such as Dahuk Governorate, but will be a central focus in 2020 for WASH but also for other UNICEF-led Clusters and Sub-Clusters (Education and Child Protection).
Despite progress, there remains room for improvement in life-cycle based, convergent programming for children and young people. In late 2019, UNICEF drilled down on cross-cutting themes for the new programme cycle 2020 to 2024. This forms a key push towards more meaningful and consistent integration and will also inform inter-sectoral and external communication efforts across the broad range of UNICEF federal and regional line Ministries, Directorates, governorate-level counterparts, as well as Iraqi and international media and public. The key areas agreed as relevant for children in Iraq, and in which UNICEF has a unique comparative advantage supported by its global mandate and country-level expertise are 1) Early Childhood Development (ECD), 2) Adolescent Development and 3) Social Norms and Behaviour Change. Of these, ECD interventions exist in UNICEF’s Education, Child Protection, and Health and Nutrition programming, but synergies have not been fully leveraged – in 2020, UNICEF will use the opportunity of the five-year ECD Strategy and costed action plan being developed under the Prime Ministerial Advisory Committee to better define interlinkages and contributions. For Adolescent Development, momentum will be carried forward to 2020, building on the recently-finalized UNICEF Iraq Second Decade Strategy. Operationally, the office is considering a standard ‘youth engagement’ clause in NGO partnership documents, as well as leveraging the country’s existing Youth Advisory Group, UNICEF’s ‘Friends of UNICEF’ group, and a recently-finalised UNICEF WASH youth-focused behaviour change action plan, as clear entry points. This would be in addition to continuing the UNICEF Iraq internship programme (inaugurated in 2019) to develop young Iraqi talent in areas relevant to UNICEF programming for children. Finally, related to Social Norms, UNICEF recognized a need to strengthen and better strategize this work noting that, although critical, it can also be labour-intensive and 
costly. During the comprehensive review of the UNICEF Iraq human resources structure for 2020 to 2024, it was agreed a dedicated international expert would be brought on board to lead Communication for Development (C4D) behaviour change communication coordination. Recruitment will take place in early 2020

MENAR,Jordan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Guided by the Grand Bargain Commitments, UNICEF Jordan promoted local efforts to develop a more efficient response to the Syrian crisis. In 2019, UNICEF Jordan used resources more effectively through vulnerability and innovative approaches across both programmes and operations.
Advancing its sustainability strategy, in mid-2019, with the involvement of the MOSD and established national NGOs, UNICEF Jordan completed the ‘nationalization’ process for the Makani programme. The shift resulted in stronger outreach to the most vulnerable children in vulnerable areas in Jordan while reducing implementation costs. It also strengthened the national social protection system by facilitating the national NGOs to become leading agents for child wellbeing across the country. This required UNICEF’s increased investment in capacity building and monitoring to ensure service quality. Also, the direct programme implementation in camps increased UNICEF’s relevance and accountability to refugees and created opportunities for incentive-based volunteering. Additional focus was given this year to intensified training for facilitators and semi-skilled Syrian refugees, resulting in greater buy-in.
To strengthen localization, the office provided innovative best practices in the selection of suppliers and contractors, with ‘added-value’ considerations factored into the selection decision, including community engagement, women’s empowerment and environmentally-friendly approaches. Bidders were encouraged to propose innovative approaches and/or products, while UNICEF introduced best practices adopted in other countries. For example, a GPS was introduced to improve the monitoring of office vehicles and those of the contractors for water trucking and desludging in the refugee camps.
UNICEF participated in two innovative cash transfers and assistance projects. Firstly, the successful pilot of the RapidPro system in cash assistance led to many national partners and sectors adopting the tool to better communicate with beneficiaries. Additionally, the Jordanian National Aid Fund (NAF) used the RapidPro system to reach over 300,000 people to register during its programme expansion phase. Based on this experience, other UN agencies and humanitarian partners are working to roll-out RapidPro as a service for members of the Common Cash Facility.
Secondly, UNICEF Jordan supported the development of a new cash delivery platform based on mobile money, building on its positive experience in 2019 of providing up to 350 volunteers with monthly incentives through mobile money. The mobile money project provided Syrian refugees and vulnerable Jordanians with access to digital financial services, facilitating their financial inclusion.
To address high rates of non-revenue water (water lost to leaks and meter bypassing), UNICEF supported the MOWI to develop a mobile phone application in collaboration with the Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ) and three semi-government utility companies to enable the public to report water leakage and wastewater overflow. While originally envisaged to only cover areas in Amman, on request from MOWI and water utilities, the application scope was expanded to the whole country, with the roll out to take place in 2020. The objective is to integrate the app into the water utility maintenance response systems, reducing response times and the volume of water lost due to leaks. The application also acts as a platform to disseminate messages through nationwide campaigns.
Following two years of construction, the final phase of the Za’atari water and wastewater networks project was completed and now delivers safe water directly to households, benefiting over 79,000 residents (44,420 children). This has ensured a more equitable distribution of water, reducing safety risks and service interruptions related to water trucking and desludging, relieving women and girls of the responsibility for collecting water, and improving the quality of life for the 5 per cent of the camp population living with disabilities. Furthermore, the complementing community mobilization strategy sustains awareness of network regulations and of the importance of water conservation. The investment in the Za’atari WASH infrastructure has reduced operating costs by two thirds, while improving quality of services and access to clean drinking water and sanitation facilities.
In NFE, implementation by organizations rooted in local communities has boosted the attendance and performance of both parents/caregivers and children in the overall programme. UNICEF supported partners to unify and simplify training and implementation; for example, by combining NFE initiatives, notably drop-out and catch-up programmes, into one methodology. Individual partners were able to integrate practices based on each of their unique added-value, while ensuring the standardization of key NFE procedures. For example, strong community mobilizers of one local NGO engaged community leaders for outreach and retention purposes, while another NGO, which excelled at enrolling and including children with disabilities in NFE programming, employed shadow teachers in classrooms to ensure inclusive education.
A significant humanitarian response continued at the north-eastern border between Jordan and Syria where the Syrian population, mostly women and children, continued to live in extremely difficult conditions in the Rukban settlement. By leveraging partnerships, UNICEF ensured the provision of life-saving services to a highly vulnerable yet inaccessible population. Together with UNHCR and UNFPA, UNICEF Jordan continued to deliver integrated primary healthcare clinics for children and infants under the age of 5, as well as for pregnant and lactating women; some limited psychosocial first aid was also provided. Hygiene and solid waste management campaigns were implemented. UNICEF engaged in an innovative approach enlisting the support of trained community volunteers to implement a rapid need assessment in the areas of education, health, nutrition, child protection, and water, sanitation and hygiene. The volunteers’ training, supervision during data collection, and the subsequent transmission of the data were all remotely managed through UNICEF’s globally tested on-line platform.
Across nationwide programmes, UNICEF has also sought to find innovative ways to involve young people in the design of its programmes and community engagement to ensure programmes are tailored to the needs of Jordan’s children and youth. On the 30th Anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNICEF launched the U-Report for young people, reaching over 40,000 active subscribers in less than three months. The national platform Nahno has proved to be an innovative, scalable and transferable solution to drive youth volunteerism and engagement, while also establishing a continuum of support to enable adolescents to contribute to communities and national development, and experience positive transitions into adulthood.

MENAR,Lebanon,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Innovation
Evidence-generation initiatives such as Neighborhood Profiling (jointly conducted by UNICEF and UNHABITAT) helped in bringing more granular data to the attention of local decision makers as well as humanitarian and development actors to identify pressing needs for the most vulnerable families and their children as well as provide baseline for projects and programmes. Developed within an area-based approach, Neighborhood Profiles have also helped partners to design (multisectoral) interventions within defined geographical areas, thus helping minimize redundancy and have helped in leveraging resources. The neighborhood profiling has greatly helped in identifying key municipalities based on multi-dimensional child vulnerability indicators and has enhanced the reach of UNICEF services through partners in an integrated manner to the most vulnerable boys and girls and their families.   This has been done by strengthening the connections and cross-referrals for various service providers together with local government institutions that can oversee and regulate such integrated support. Tripoli was the first municipality that has used the neighbourhood profile data for its direct and focused service delivery interventions; which is being replicated in other municipalities which have been mapped with the highest amount of children with multiple vulnerabilities.
UNICEF’s emergency WASH programme continues towards the development of an on-site single-tank-based wastewater treatment system that can significantly reduce tensions related to environmental pollution, but also be used by surrounding host communities. Similar innovative initiatives have been identified at community level to provide water and wastewater services benefiting both refugees and host communities: UNICEF continues to advocate for and develop concepts of public fountains and integrated mobile wastewater treatment plants. UNICEF Lebanon also supported the WASH Information Management system improved a monitoring tool “Healthy Camp Monitoring Tool”. This tool measures to which extent WASH and environmental health results have been achieved in hundreds of informal Syrian refugees settlements and inform on priority remediation actions by the communities and partners – it uses tablets with KoBo data collection system and online analysis dashboard. The tool “Healthy Camp Monitoring tool” informs programming through a better measurement of the impact of WASH intervention, including on a protection angle, as the accessibility of WASH services, lighting, and privacy. It is also used as a monitoring tool for frontline workers, UNICEF staff and TPMs.
UNICEF has been able to make progress in providing support to Ministry of Public Health to further develop the Mobile EPI Registry Application (MERA), for all Primary Health Care centers, dispensaries, vaccination points at UNHCR registration sites and boarders. MERA now serves as a national electronic EPI Registry platform. The system was successfully utilized in Measles National Immunization Campaign – phase 1, were it provided timely data that enhanced intra-campaign monitoring. This application is aligned with the MoPH calendar of Immunization, as well as national rules and regulations,
and records vaccination services of children under 18 years of age in Lebanon. It allows the generation of a unique barcode to track the vaccination status of every registered child. Barcodes support community outreach workers to track and follow up each child’s vaccination status and alerts caregivers
about any gap in the vaccination schedule. In addition, the MERA allows for stock monitoring of vaccines at all EPI points and is used in nurseries, public schools and primary health care facilities. UNICEF is fundraising to further develop and scale up MERA, to include other health services and to
create a parallel application for caregivers on Immunization and other primary health services.
 
Lessons Learned
UNICEF’s provision of life skills packages is reported to have a multi-dimensional impact on adolescents and youth.  Engaging young people from different communities, and nationalities, in joint activities strengthened the social cohesion factor between Syrian and Lebanese youth. UNICEF, through its life skills programme, encouraged the Lebanese, Syrian and Palestinian adolescents and youth to improve all aspects of their relationships with themselves and the others, which had eventually reflected on their communities, especially that the different activities focused on non-violent ways to resolve conflicts and address challenges. The life skills programme did not only develop participants’ skills, but it had also provided them with a safe space to express their ideas and share their experiences, fears, and emotions.
UNICEF Lebanon, through its various programmes, are working with private companies and private entities that can directly support the Programme. In 2019, the CO has therefore initiated a process to map the private sector and explore its potential for direct support to our programmatic priorities even in these difficult economic times. This exercise should provide us with a clearer idea of who the main stakeholders are, and what the best opportunities for collaboration may be.
The current crisis has also meant that we have had to respond to our own organizational needs with a full application of all the available flexibility that UNICEF rules and regulations would allow. At the peak of the protests and unrest, to accommodate the situation the office widely applied Flexible Working Arrangements. The HR unit further extended its staff counselling services the regional/local staff counsellor. LCO also collaborated proactively on the inter-agency level, particularly on advanced local salary payments and conversion of currency of local salary. Given its strategic location, UNICEF accommodated several other UN agencies to operate from its premises during the peak of the crisis, when the other UN offices were not accessible.
Following the report of the independent task force on workplace gender-discrimination, sexual harassment, harassment and abuse of authority, UNICEF Lebanon country office established a dedicated taskforce. The taskforce aims to compile and analyze information received from the ITF report as well as feedback received from LCO staff on the report. In addition, the taskforce is to enhance and coordinate systematic support to respond to the needs and recommendations of staff following the ITF report. The taskforce will further enhance the creation of a trust and healthy work environment promoting UNICEF values. The task force has since established a detailed action plan addressing the four main pillars of the ITF report along with a timeframe to address the issues relevant to LCO context. Implementation will begin in early 2020 following the endorsement of LCO staff members.

MENAR,Libya,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"33        Based on successful implementation, UNICEF will scale-up the following programme innovations in 2020: 
(a) BAYTI centres are community-based child-friendly spaces. Bayti centres were designed as a comprehensive strategy to provide multi-sectoral service provision to all vulnerable children identified through community-led outreach and referral. Programmes at these centres are designed to promote and contribute to children and young people’s full development, addressing their physical, cognitive, social and emotional well-being. It links interventions in education (learning support services), child protection (psychosocial support services), adolescent and youth participation (life skills and innovation labs), and health services. During 2020, UNICEF will strengthen and expand services) in the 10 Bayti centres and other safe spaces across Libya, including through intersectoral coordination and strengthening partnership with other agencies (e.g. IOM and UNHCR)
(b) Rapid Response Mechanism – UN Delivering as One: This year, UNICEF spearheaded the establishment of the Rapid Response Mechanism to respond to the needs of conflict-affected children and their families (including migrants) in and around Tripoli. UNICEF, together with WFP, UNFPA and IOM managed to reach more than 40,000 individuals (8,000 families) with an integrated minimum life-saving package of assistance (Food, NFIs). This mechanism continues to be an effective example of the UN delivering as one in a humanitarian crisis, together with local partners and in coordination with municipalities and local authorities and during the spike of the conflict contributed to at least half of overall UN assistance to the affected communities. 
34        There are strong indications that the situation in Libya may continue to be unstable and volatile for the near future. UNICEF began an external evaluation of its Country Programme at the end of 2019; the results of this evaluation will feed into a Mid-Term Review of its programme to determine what components need to be adjusted given the evolving context. Though continued support and system strengthening of the national basic service system will continue to be a priority, UNICEF recognizes the importance of strong and up-to-date internal risk assessment and contingency plans. Additionally, UNICEF will continue to strengthen its internal emergency preparedness measures during 2020, including (a) identifying solid partnerships that are able to rapidly scale-up response (including hard to reach/inaccessible areas); (b) ensure that pre-positioned essential stocks are available to allow for a rapid response; (c) strengthen its mechanisms for Accountability to Affected Population, including systematizing complaints and reporting mechanisms across its programmes; (d) build the capacity of partners and UNICEF staff to ensure emergency preparedness and response, including with regards to the humanitarian principles and Accountability to Affected Populations; (e) enhance the quality of emergency response, including through the diversification of the package of emergency response, expanding the targeted areas and beneficiaries, and introducing cash transfer interventions; and (f) secure flexible funding that allows UNICEF to respond to priority needs, as necessary. 
35        Due to the uniqueness of the Libyan context, UNICEF faced a number of operational challenges, such as multiple office locations and multiple accommodations arrangements and constant staff movement back and forth between Tunisia and Libya. UNICEF Libya needs to maintain flexible operational arrangements to allow for flexible, rapid increase and decrease as need. In hindsight, the decision to push for the closure of the UNICEF Libya office in Tunisia in 2018 was not the best option. UNICEF Libya is currently in the process of exploring options to re-establish its office in Tunisia.
36        Evidence generation is essential in the Libyan context. UNICEF and its partners and national counterparts are acutely aware that without improved institutionalized information management systems across the social service system, significant and long-term improvements in basic service delivery is extremely difficult. For this reason, the development of the information management systems in education, child protection, the justice sector for children and water management will remain a central priority during 2020. National household survey is also essential to respond to the information gap and as such will be a priority for UNICEF and all national counterparts across Libya in 2020.
"
MENAR,Morocco,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In 2019, the office conducted a mid-term review (MTR) of the 2017-21 programme of cooperation.   While the MTR concluded that the programme continues to be relevant, effectively contributing to national priorities/reforms and well-aligned with the sustainable development agenda, the persistence of   inequities, especially in rural areas, calls for adjustments based on lessons learned, as summarised below.
Balancing National/Regional/local
While national reform processes (particularly in education, social protection and child rights monitoring) have generally provided for opportunities to advance child rights and strongly position UNICEF as the guardian of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, their slow pace affects the achievement of some targets and brings to the surface the need for more strategic investment in national and local capacity strengthening in order to address broader governance challenges. 
The ongoing decentralization reform and sectoral deconcentration of services offer opportunities for the State and UNICEF to better tailor programmatic responses to specific contexts and address equity gaps. The estimated 100,000 community-based organizations which can potentially expand the outreach of government services and administration through what already appears as a strong understanding in their complementary roles in service delivery, especially to most vulnerable communities, is solid ground for further strengthening of a strategic compact at regional/local-level in support to the most vulnerable children. The strategic approach the office adopted and implemented to support migrant children  has shown the relevance of maintaining a balanced approach between a state-driven leg - able to influence  and monitor the broader implementation of the National Strategy on Migration and the Global Compacts, as well as contribute to enhance multi-stakeholder coordination - with a more tailored equity-based approach in coordination with local administrations and civil society organizations (CSO) able to find solutions to the immediate needs.
The Education sector, with UNICEF support, has balanced well a national reform vision with strategic modelling at local-level under the leadership of local education administrations as well as in partnership with CSOs. As a clear step forward, it is key that UNICEF continues to support national and regional/local partners to accelerate the scaling up of ‘modelled’ interventions (preschool education, second chance schools), and quality assurance for the appropriate application of recently approved norms and standards. Equally important, UNICEF will need to exercise a strategic (informal) convening role by facilitating coordination/dialogue among main stakeholders contributing to the preschool universalization so to ensure accelerated coverage, impact and opportunities for all, especially the most vulnerable.  Following a Gender Programme Review, UNICEF will step up efforts to improve access and completion of secondary education, and transition to active life for girls, especially those living in rural areas.
Moreover, the MTR highlighted the need to adjust and prioritize rural communities to accelerate progress on child health related indicators given significant urban/rural disparities. Despite the progress made by Morocco, significant challenges remain to fully benefit particularly girls and women in rural communities. Efforts to further reduce mortality and high stunting prevalence will require to adopt a multidisciplinary approach promoting community health systems. The successful partnership with the National Initiative on Human Development and the ongoing support to the modelling of an integrated community-based health system will offer the opportunity to strengthen local multi-sectoral/multi-partner approaches and synergies.
Improved Integration/Coordination
As highlighted by the evaluation conducted in 2019 of UNICEF’s multi-sectoral programme in support of adolescence and youth (FORSA), the office needs to reinforce internal coordination mechanisms. The FORSA project demonstrated great potential for complementarity between CSO and institutional partners in the development and integration of adolescent girls, adolescents and vulnerable young people into working life. This potential however has remained underutilized, despite many attempts to mobilize successful institutional-CSO partnerships. The general implementation strategy of FORSA could have been expanded to establish a harmonized approach between stakeholders, promote the establishment of bridges between components/sectors, and enhance complementarities.
A more integrated approach and improved convergence of UNICEF-supported programmes becomes of capital importance to influence child-centred and equity-based regional development plans. A more strategic and coordinated approach to address the complex structure of regional administrations needs to be put in place, potentially resulting in enhanced integrated and well-coordinated approaches at local- level, particularly around horizontal/cross-cutting thematic issues such as youth, early childhood development, and migration.
Diversified Partnerships, Improved Evidence-Based Advocacy, and Leveraging
Constrained results areas required diversified and strategic partnerships in 2019. Especially for Child Protection system strengthening, the office diversified its partnership to accelerate results and will need to look at the potential of strengthening support to CSOs in providing services at local-level. This would benefit further from appropriate guidance and technical support, in partnership with subnational actors, and other partners present on the ground. The recent opening for the office’s work on public finance for children, the progress made in the social protection reform with UNICEF support, and the ongoing decentralization reform, call for a more strategic, right-based advocacy function and a clear/consistent partnership analysis and strategy in support to the important role to play in leveraging resources for children.
Given this, the development of an all-Office advocacy strategy, planned for early 2020, will help the Office prioritize its strategic partnerships to make public money work for children, address social norms, improve legislation, and strengthen child rights monitoring, and assess and mitigate risks in taking bolder approaches to sensitive issues, such as child marriage, including decisions on public and private advocacy, and best messengers.  Evidence, data and analyses arising from the recently completed Situation Analysis can also best be capitalized upon from an advocacy perspective.
The office continued to have positive results in establishing financial partnerships, mobilising in 2019 a record level of annual income.  This included, for the first time this cycle, mobilising domestic resources in support of UNICEF programmes. The potential long-term impact of this is significant as it opens a new avenue for resource mobilisation for UNICEF's work in Morocco.  Nevertheless, the office will need to be strategic in how it engages with domestic resources and ensure that UNICEF’s added value is focused on technical assistance for innovations and solutions applied to accelerate results at scale.
 
"
MENAR,Oman,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Operating in a high-income country such as Oman, which still desires programme support from UNICEF, requires a change from the usual programming modality applicable to lower- and middle-income developing countries. Due to UNICEF’s small presence and limited resources, the programme was adjusted to refocus on activities with large-scale impact, visibility, and catalytic effects.  
During 2019, UNICEF engaged in more upstream work and the main focus of programme activities was in the form of providing technical support and conducting policy advocacy, among which establishment of models that can be taken to scale by the Government was prioritized. This included work on setting up and piloting the cross-sectoral case management system as well as development of the IECD model. The work on these models has proven to be an effective strategy in a high-income developing country, where the Government has resources to take them to scale.
To ensure the success of models promoted by UNICEF, deliberate efforts were made to ensure that they are based on existing models which have been previously tried and tested in other countries of similar contexts and have yielded results. Other key criteria met, to persuade the government to accept and replicate models, included:

A focus on approaches that were tangible rather than conceptual and where examples from other countries and contexts existed and could be presented to counterparts;
Most importantly the models were adaptable and simple enough to fit into existing government systems without difficulty, and were intended to complement existing services and governance structures to allow replication without too much difficulty at national and local levels;
Ability to show visible results in a short time, while work towards long-term gains was underway,
In addition, high-level advocacy as well as field visits with Government officials to the pilot sites at the launch stage and later at the review stages, proved essential with ensuring ownership.
While these approaches proved beneficial, the year brought additional lessons that require consideration as UNICEF continues to support the Government with taking these models to scale.
The model must be cost-effective and efficient. Despite Oman being a high-income country, it became evident that in order for supported models to be taken to scale and result in impactful change it is imperative that they are accompanied by costed action plans and financing strategies. This would allow line Ministries to make an investment case for prioritizing such models over other programming approaches. During 2020, UNICEF will therefore prioritize working with the Government on public finance for children solutions so that it can best be supported to scale up proposed models.
Roll-out of cross-sectoral national programmes require significant investment in human resource capacity, which requires enhancement despite Oman’s high-income status; this is particularly true in relation to service delivery at local levels where child-centred approaches are lacking. Piloting of the cross-sectoral case management system highlighted the increasing need for a well-qualified social service workforce that has the skills required to successfully support case management processes in relation to identification, communication, assessment, referral, child participation, child rights, community engagement and advocacy.
To build such skills within the social service workforce, the social workers who were involved in the pilot received intensive training and coaching over the piloting phase.  Yet, during implementation the need to further strengthen their capacity, specifically in areas related to child protection and child rights, became evident. This was particularly important because the promoted methods represented a shift away from how the national social service workforce usually approaches case management.
To respond to this, an assessment tool for the social service workforce was developed with the aim of deepening the understanding of gaps in capacity and skills. During 2020, results from the assessment will be used to inform planning and design of accredited professional development and training programs with a focus on areas where there are identified gaps. This will represent a shift away from support for ad-hoc capacity building to more consolidated approaches through the Government’s training institutes and universities. Such sustainable solutions will be necessary to ensure a strong and capable workforce with the skills and knowledge necessary to support the effective and efficient implementation of the case management platform and other responsibilities pertaining to their role, as the system goes to scale.
Cross-sectoral governance structures must be enhanced at both the national and governorate levels, to ensure that models of a holistic nature can succeed. At the level of the UNICEF Programme, the Programme Management Group (PMG), comprised of representatives from the Ministries of Education, Health, Social Development, and the National Centre for Statistics and Information, acts as a steering committee for the programme. The PMG has been instrumental in resolving many obstacles in programme implementation; it has promoted more efficient cross-sectoral linkages and has facilitated the endorsement of more progressive interventions.
At the national level there are a number of cross-sectoral bodies that could be similarly effective in promoting child-centred approaches and UNICEF is therefore looking to engage these more actively to ensure maximum impact and synergies.  As part of the work on the IECD Model, for example, a comprehensive governance structure has been proposed, which would build on reform of the existing cross-sectoral National Committee for Family Affairs to ensure holistic oversight of the ECD sector. The Committee is a high-level decision-making body that is chaired by the Minister of Social Development and has several sitting members, who are Undersecretaries in related ministries and entities. Reform of this influential body to become responsible for oversight of the ECD sector would be a positive example with regards to how different actors can work together at the national level.  Similar examples exist at the sub-national level, where as part of the work on the cross-sectoral case management system, the protocols for collaboration amongst the cross-sectoral Child Protection Committees were revisited to facilitate work across sectors and thus promoted enhanced impact.
During 2020 UNICEF will continue to use its convening role to ensure further operationalization of such approaches.
"
MENAR,"Palestine, State of",Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Marked by continued-conflict, insecurity, child rights violations, humanitarian needs and a trend of de-development, the context poses multiple challenges in achieving long-term sustainable progress. Remarkable achievements of the last decades in establishing basic services in SoP leading to 99% immunization rates and 94% participation in primary education are in serious jeopardy. Ongoing National Policy Agenda efforts to reach the most-vulnerable, promote livelihoods and opportunities for youth, and improve quality and accessibility of services require strong institutions, stability, financial resources, and hope. In the absence of prospects for a lasting solution, it remains challenging to promote the achievement of every right for every child.
Increased vulnerabilities in a context fraught with complexities, including diminished financial resources of the PA, the persistent Palestinian-divide, shrinking operational-space for civil society organizations, pushed UNICEF to step-up its resource mobilization efforts and partnerships to preserve previous gains and sharpen focus in meeting the growing development and humanitarian needs. Thus, UNICEF has been able to win the engagement and commitment of several national and international actors to make significant investments for Palestinian children in an otherwise difficult financial climate.
Deepening poverty, hopelessness and despair in Gaza fueled the continuation of Great March of Return (GMR) protests resulting in several child injuries and deaths. UNICEF promoted an integrated-response to the GMR injuries through referral systems across child protection actors. Summer activities provided children in Gaza with opportunities to learn life-skills and to protect children from increased vulnerability during moments of risk.  Integrated prevention and protection interventions for at-risk youth in East Jerusalem aim to reduce the incidence and impact of insecurity on children. Absence of a political process to remove barriers and reduce violence will continue to require international investment and support. Further, given pervading violence and significant stresses faced by families and caregivers, considerable effort will be given to finalizing and obtaining endorsement for the multi-sectoral strategy to eliminate violence against children, with emphasis on providing mental-health and psychosocial support. UNICEF SoP will draw on good practices from other countries, particularly in the region on strategies adopted to address violence, including those in support of behavior-change and the monitoring and measurement of progress.
 
UNICEF interventions in SoP focused on solutions to improve water and sanitation systems and to address energy dimensions of the Gaza water-crisis, and reinforcing linkages between humanitarian and development programming. This included renewable solutions like solar-power, rainwater harvesting and promoting behavioral change to conserve water which reduces the impact of climate change on children. These advances, along with the powerful proof of concept established with the construction of the SGDP, are attracting long-term investments to the Gaza water and sanitation sector. However, the lack of a system for operations and maintenance of WASH facilities due to limited-funding and unclear institutional accountabilities, especially in Gaza, is jeopardizing sustainability of investments. Development partners, including UNICEF, are pushing for the implementation of planned reforms in the WASH sector, so that investments are not wasted. UNICEF will build on its reputation in the WASH sector as a partner of choice to continue advocating for greater coordination and information sharing for effective, efficient and sustainable solutions.
 
To address neglect, exclusion, and violence against children, UNICEF SoP supported a Knowledge Attitude Practice (KAP) baseline study to identify societal factors that influence nurturing care and positive parenting practices for children with disabilities or developmental delays and to establish ways of increasing the demand for services. The findings confirmed that children with developmental delays and disabilities in the SoP are often severely marginalized in their communities. They and their parents/caregivers struggle with stigma and discrimination, transporting their children to receive services, lack of funding for assistive devices like wheelchairs, poorly-built or damaged roads, and an inability to pay for transportation services. An ECD communication for development strategy was developed with adolescents with disabilities and families with children with disabilities. The strategy has been endorsed by the MoSD and will be implemented by the relevant ministries and local NGO partners. UNICEF will continue working with targeted communities to develop and implement community action plans to ensure proper engagement of local communities.
 
UNICEF SoP engaged with the Bank of Palestine (BoP) to promote wider engagement with the private sector on child rights and find synergies in programming priorities. In 2019, the ECD programming utilized the BoP ATM machines to promote messaging on early childhood development targeting parents. This partnership allowed for much broader dissemination of messaging than would have otherwise been possible.
 
Despite there being a national planning and coordination framework around the National Policy Agenda, Sector Strategies and Policies, the implementation of some critical policies remains incomplete particularly roll-out at governorate level. Moreover, there is still not a functioning institution responsible for tracking investments related to children. The challenge of policy implementation is acute given the geographic-divide between the West Bank and Gaza, which leads to some policies being implemented in Gaza and others not. In Child Protection the operational plan developed with the MoSD has provided an opportunity to discuss ways to overcome this divide. Programmatic responses have been adjusted to include self-care for responders in Gaza given that they are witnessing and responding to children and adults affected by serious injuries, including amputations and manifesting symptoms of mental distress and illness.
 
The engagement of SoP with the CRC Committee and the observations that will result on behalf of the Committee will provide a unique platform for engagement with institutions and the public on priority action to fulfil the rights of every child. Constructive engagement with the State Party and civil society throughout the full cycle of reporting to the CRC has positioned UNICEF as a partner of choice to identify and prioritize innovative solutions for children and young people. At the same time, the campaign against CEDAW which has emerged in the last months of 2019 in SoP reminds us of the importance of investing in changing community attitudes to really affect change on critical issues related to violence and exploitation of women and children.

MENAR,Saudi Arabia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In developing the 2019-2023 programme cooperation between UNICEF and the Gulf, UNICEF GAO reflected substantively on the ways it could strengthen its contributions to, and partnership with, the countries of the sub-region. The resulting programme addressed this reflection in several important ways. Firstly, it outlined a strategic set of programme priorities that are relevant across the sub-region, responsive to the national development aspirations of the various countries, and leverages UNICEF’s comparative advantage of multi-sector expertise. Secondly, UNICEF GAO recognized that it could partner more effectively with the countries of the region to also share their achievements and lessons learned in contribution to global “public goods” in child development.  Lastly, the programme of cooperation called for a deeper presence by UNICEF in each of the countries – one that seamlessly integrates technical expertise in programmes, advocacy, partnerships and fundraising. Lessons learned here take stock of the assumptions and priorities underpinning this revised operational model.

The programme priorities of early childhood development, child protection and data continue to resonate with partners and remain relevant against national development priorities, primarily for their multi-sector nature (given strong state capacities to deliver basic social services). In addition, this engagement has sharpened the need to focus on programmatic enablers and strategies – such as promotion of a human rights-based approach to programming as well as utilizing communication for development to reach families, communities and the public for advocacy, creating demand for existing services, creating awareness around referral to services and most importantly, to inform national programmes and policies.  In a period of substantial change, UNICEF should increasingly work with partners to ensure the most vulnerable in society are not left behind. Finally, as the sub-regional priorities are substantively linked with development plans, it is important to quickly bring on board the senior technical expertise planned for in the programme. Incoming staff will need to develop and trigger national and international networks to advance these priority result areas rapidly.
Establishing an office in Qatar has helped to validate the operational model of the sub-regional programme which calls for a substantive investment in the national priorities of the Gulf countries, while supporting Gulf-based actors as they deepen and expand their commitments and advocacy for children in the region and around the world.  The new presence in Qatar has yielded real-time information on opportunities for engagement, allowed UNICEF to be more responsive of emerging priorities, and demonstrated areas in which UNICEF can partner in Qatar across the breadth of the organization.
Facilitating exchange between UNICEF GAO countries. As incoming staff join UNICEF GAO, it will become important to identify strategic moments to facilitate knowledge exchange between the Gulf countries, noting that while there are differences between countries, there are substantive areas of convergence – around early childhood and positive parenting, on scaling up responses and systems to address violence against children, and in meeting data needs in the context of the SDGs.
UNICEF’s engagement in high income country contexts. The reporting year has also yielded important lessons about the nature of technical support required from countries in the Gulf – that it be best-in-field and delivered in a timely fashion. UNICEF will need to think through new approaches of delivering this support leveraging UNICEF’s presence and expertise around the world. In addition, as a knowledge leader on children, UNICEF GAO, needs to more nimbly respond to “one-off” requests by referring partners to technical support wherever it resides – within the organization or through the organization’s expanded networks.
Maintaining dialogue with key partners. Engagement with UNICEF’s traditional public partners this year underlined the importance of maintaining an active dialogue to exchange information and vision regarding humanitarian and development cooperation; advocacy for child rights, and innovation.  The diversification of interest by partners, both programmatic and geographic, as well as their support to longer-term predictable income requires sustained investment (both staff time and resources by UNICEF GAO). This includes the preparation of capacity building activities such as high-level dialogue, partnership deep dives and skill-share workshops.
Maintaining engagement at the highest level.  Interactions between UNICEF and its key partners at the leadership level continues to be of critical importance in pushing our joint agenda and in expediting decisions regarding the allocation of humanitarian and development funding.
The legal framework regulating private sector engagement. There is a range of modalities across the Gulf for engaging with the private sector, particularly around fundraising through the general public, HNWIs and foundations. UNICEF GAO continues to engage with authorities to better understand towards a more comprehensive partnership with the private sector.
Advancing emerging priorities for UNICEF and children. UNICEF GAO appreciates that while Gulf countries are looking to accelerate results around pending social development goals, especially around human capital development (primary health care, quality in education, child protection systems strengthening), they are also deeply interested in partnering with UNICEF around topics around which they can lead or contribute substantively.  During the reporting year, this included expressed interest in children and digital media, children and urban planning (including child friendly cities), and mental health and well-being. UNICEF will need to think through how it can use these strategic opportunities to advance learning and programming in emerging fields.
While the sub-regional programme does not have an explicit focus on adolescent and young people, it does recognize that investments in early childhood, child protection and data are important contributions to their development. In addition, UNICEF GAO’s efforts to expand its partnership base will provide numerous platforms to address the growing interest by Government in young people and skills development for future economics. The, Generation Unlimited, is equally as relevant in the Gulf as in other parts of the world – with its focus on quality and relevant secondary education. Other opportunities are also emerging through UN Country Teams in the UAE and in KSA."
MENAR,Sudan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Looking back at 2019, SCO recognized that while Sudan faced many challenges, this year presented  opportunities that needed to be embraced and acted upon quickly. The annual review and on-going MTR processes allowed the country office to collectively gain an appreciation of lessons learned and take advantage of the more favorable operating environment to identify what adjustments are needed in the overall strategic approach and take these into account in the planning for next year and for the remainder of the country programme. There was consensus that the priorities originally set out for the country program remain valid.
There was also agreement that to gain the trust of and demonstrate support to the new government, UNICEF should work on a two-track approach and consider areas where demonstrable results could be achieved in the short term and costed, and scalable models can be developed. In parallel, there needs to be a renewed focus on strengthening capacities and systems in a sustainable manner and on building back institutions. With the on-going reforms, there is an evident need to explore new areas and modalities of engagement, through knowledge sharing, training, secondment of experts within the new government structures, and South-South collaboration. UNICEF has already initiated advocacy with the new government, taking the opportunity of the restructuring of the Ministry of Interior to establish child rights and human rights structures within relevant ministries.
In view of the recurring nature of the climate-related disasters and ensuing disease outbreaks, the focus on risk-informed programming was found to be more relevant than ever. Attention to preparedness and prevention not only promotes resilience but is also more cost-effective and sustainable in the longer term, e.g. blanket disinfection of all water sources not only during emergencies but also during routine daily water supply operations. Expanding the urban sanitation program and making use of best practices from the El Fasher and Zalingei urban WASH project would mainstream IDPs into long-term planning and limit outbreaks in future. Consideration of climate change and integrated water resource management principles in planning water supply interventions is key to ensuring water security and fostering peace among competing users. In partnership with the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), UNICEF contributed to climate-resilient development and integrated water resources management (IWRM) approach in Darfur and the eastern states of Sudan. Detailed hydro-geological assessments including the development of locality level catchment maps is furthering IWRM approach and sustainability of community water sources.  Innovative approaches such as the use of hybrid solar powered hand pumps at an additional cost of just USD 5,000 enhanced the water security of up to 1000 people.
The need for further enhancing the SCO convergent approach to reach the desired  impact of the programme on the lives of children needs to be addressed through better geographic and programme convergence. The office has already engaged in an evidence-based vulnerability analysis and re-targeting exercise to ensure better geographic focus. Multi-sectoral partnerships and more convergent programme delivery were promoted with NGO partners, which have resulted in the selection of fewer partners and increased focus. This would also help in monitoring of programmes and ensure better accountability.
Common delivery platforms both at the government and community levels are effective in promoting convergence such as using front-line workers (FLWs) for integrated delivery of services rather than separate FLWs for each sector. The C4D strategy proposed this as a successful means of integrating all existing community platforms (i.e. mothers’ and fathers’ groups, CLTC, parent-teacher associations, and the child protection network) and increasing the uptake of health, nutrition, WASH, and other services.
The Can’t Wait to Learn and ongoing integrated education projects, have demonstrated that more considered programme design and innovative approaches have potential to achieve results beyond education and could serve as a model for integrated programming, in meeting the needs of children more holistically and through the lifecycle. Education interventions could be coupled with child protection, WASH, health, nutrition and C4D  using digital game-based learning material on tablets.
The strategic prioritization workshop held in November also highlighted areas of improvement where staff felt that the human rights principles including gender equality and children’s participation are not fully integrated in programming. Among reasons identified for this were the tendency towards short-term programming as a result of the humanitarian nature of a big part of the programme and also funding constraints and limited duration of many of the SCO grants; as well as challenges in evidence generation and vulnerability analysis which led to weak application of equity/ leave no one behind principle.
Community engagement was also considered to be suboptimal. By developing effective leadership at community and locality levels, results are more likely to be sustained. Encouragement and engagement of community champions on developing local solutions for the construction and maintenances of household latrines in return areas helped in sustaining ODF status in their communities. Similarly, school enrollment campaigns and community sensitization were found to be effective in identifying OOSC, addressing social issues, and developing positive attitude towards education. The engagement of local leaders in rebel-controlled areas in East Jebel Marra in South Darfur successfully helped to introduce nutrition and vaccination services and to establish outpatient therapeutic programmes (OTPs) for the treatment of SAM cases in these areas.
Focus on quality also emerged as a cause for concern as feedback from staff and donors alike identified the need for looking beyond numbers and ensuring that programmes delivered intended results. This was particularly true for construction-related interventions where the SCO needs to strengthen planning and monitoring to ensure deadlines, specifications, and quality standards are met. Where necessary, the office should use experts to monitor the quality of construction work. The engagement of third parties (well-qualified roving construction site engineers) to assist the SCO was considered as a feasible option for monitoring and quality assurance oversight and strengthening the internal capacity to manage the end-to-end of construction activities. Additionally, the quality of supplies or inputs could be improved through community feedback mechanisms such as end-user monitoring and third-party monitoring.
The education programme found that to impact quality dimensions within schools and learning centers there needs to be emphasis on not just inputs to build more effective learning environments, but also on processes between these e.g. not only are learning materials arriving into classrooms, but teachers receive training and ongoing support on how to directly use those materials with students and check for learning. The high number of volunteer teachers and limited learning spaces imply a need for a second shift and designing encouraging and enabling methods to support learning and teaching.
There were positive gains in spite of the unstable socioeconomic and political climate in 2019. Government upheld the commitment to provide its share of budget requirements for non-GAVI vaccines - testimony to the success of UNICEF’s high-level engagement. UNICEF will build on this progress and use the momentum of new reforms to push for higher government investment in health, nutrition and also education in 2020 and beyond, with the ultimate goal of total government ownership of routine immunization.
A pilot project for life skills and UPSHIFT programme, which targeted adolescents (including refugees) is a customized model of the global Generation Unlimited initiative. Interesting and promising results were achieved in the areas of empowerment, skills building and social innovation. There is a need to expand this project geographically and thematically including the financial literacy module developed by Aflatoun as a social entrepreneurship training.[1]  Engagement with youth also showed promising opportunities for using creative, artistic and digital tools to advocate for child rights. The successful engagement of community level youth groups in the cholera and flood responses to raise awareness and increase chlorination activities contributed to controlling the outbreak with low-cost interventions.

UNICEF in collaboration with the FMOH and Gavi launched a solarization project in rural areas which leveraged power supplied primarily for cold chain for the benefit of entire health facilities, yielding multiple benefits. The eco-friendly initiative is expected to help mitigate the effects of climate change.
UNICEF is thankful to a multitude of donor partners that accompany us in the piloting of innovative ways to reach more children more effectively in Sudan.

MENAR,Syria,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The protracted nature of the Syrian crisis has become the norm, demanding responsive programming implying that when undertaking short-term, singular responses to the sudden surge of humanitarian needs, mid- and longer-term impact on resilience must be considered. Hence, 2019 embodied a continued shift in programming towards more resilience-based interventions, both in humanitarian response and development programming.
While implementing programmes in a highly complex, volatile context, UNICEF Syria Country Office recognized the need to systematically promote the generation, dissemination and use of knowledge. The first knowledge management strategy adopted in 2019 produced four case studies. Two of these cases, namely Participatory Action Research and the Integrated Communication Initiative in Der-ez-Zor, are introduced later in this section.
As reflected in all programmes and advocacy results of 2019, UNICEF increased its partnerships across the spectrum: the faith-based organizations. have proven to be very effective implementing partners with far reach and strong ties to the communities. UNICEF will continue working with them in 2020 and will invest in their capacity across the board. The Community-Based Organizations have proven to be vital in engaging adolescents, youth and community at large. In the areas of academics and research institutions some collaboration occurred but will need to increase in 2020.
Within the humanitarian context, UNICEF continued to work within its mandate to lead the WASH, Education and Nutrition sectors and the Child Protection area of responsibility, working closely with implementing partners and other UN Agencies. Through sector coordination, UNICEF was a key contributor to the development of the 2019 Humanitarian Needs Overview and the subsequent Humanitarian Response Plan, initiating innovative ways of mapping information.
In addition to a more deliberate method of programming for resilience in the ongoing Syrian crisis, key innovative approaches in 2019 included:
 
Building on a research conducted in 2016 in the Middle East and North Africa region, UNICEF and its partners conducted Participatory Action Research (PAR) to generate evidence with and for young people. The objective of PAR is to empower youth to lead community-based research, to support them in becoming change-makers and to advocate on issues relevant to them. By partnering with young people, PAR fosters empowerment and gives members of marginalized and vulnerable groups a voice. It also allows young people to maximize their everyday knowledge, networks and personal experiences to bring new perspectives.
The initiative, which took place in Aleppo, Rural Damascus, Hama and Tartous was led by 37 young researchers who engaged 461 peers. The initiative was notable in that youth empowerment and PAR is not widespread in Syria, and that evidence was generated on the situation of children which resulted in recommendations made by the young researchers.
Observing that that the most vulnerable youth had the least access to opportunities, the young researchers recommended: increasing financial support to young people and their families to positively influence their choices; increasing decent job opportunities for young people and linkages with training; improving access to educational opportunities for boys and girls; and increasing scholarship opportunities. UNICEF supported the dissemination of the report and is advocating with the Government for the implementation of these recommendations.
 
In the past, UNICEF in Syria has had to respond to urgent needs, focusing on the delivery of life-saving assistance and messages through a sectoral approach. This year, the County Office made an explicit effort to achieve results via an Integrated Communication for Development approach.
In partnership with the Government and partners, and through community engagements, UNICEF created public awareness and demand for Health, WASH and Education services in Deir-ez-Zor Governorate. The initiative identified children who dropped out of school or missed immunization and referred them to relevant services (e.g. nearest health center or appropriate education pathways). This allowed partners to carry out comprehensive and integrated community awareness on issues related to Health (immunization), Nutrition (IYCF), Education, WASH (hygiene promotion) and mine risk education.
The initiative included house-to-house visits, awareness sessions in schools and mosques, meeting with key influencers and community leaders, distribution of information, education and communication materials. This reached over 276,000 people (51 per cent female), including 165,000 children. All children identified as missing education or health services received referral cards to be shown at the nearby school or health facility, which also served as a monitoring mechanism. A total of 10,344 referral cards for health and 4,848 cards for education were distributed. By collecting the cards from the health facilities and schools, UNICEF found that at least 18 per cent of the referred children were enrolled in school, while 24 per cent of the children referred to the health centers for immunization and other reasons visited them. This is a positive development, given that much of the population had been restricted from accessing these basic services for several years and that trust in services needed to be repaired. In the future, more efforts will be undertaken to have these children benefitting from health and education services.
 
In 2019, UNICEF invested in enhancing Accountability to Affected Populations to promote and facilitate active engagement of communities and affected populations. This is to ensure that participants’ feedback informs programme interventions and that they have access to a grievance mechanism. Surveys and focus group discussions were conducted to monitor satisfaction levels of the beneficiaries of UNICEF-supported services such as health and immunization, child protection centers, life-skills development for young people, cash transfers for families with children with disabilities, education and hygiene promotion.
Analyses of results yielded recommendations for improved service provision, including the need to reinforce the local communities’ participation in defining the needs, to enhance the effectiveness of the programmes. For example, on the skills development courses for young people, service providers were encouraged to proactively receive inputs from youth on the type and content of the courses. Further, an example of initial results included that UNICEF started to reimburse the transportation fee for vulnerable population, such as young people attending learning activities, based on their attendance records, as supporting transport costs for learning activities can facilitate increased attendance.
"
MENAR,Tunisia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Over the past years, UNICEF invested a lot in modelling through a bottom up approach, ensuring consultations with - and inclusion of - all stakeholders. Taking into account the high mobilisation efforts required due to the wide heterogeneity of partners, and the frequent changes among key decision-makers and technical government staff, the significant time spent at the drawing board for the development of innovative approaches that would make a real tangible difference for children Tunisia de facto delayed project implementation and have resulted in that the country office has had to ask several donor contract extensions.
The approach is now clearly starting to bear its fruit. Government partners have taken full ownership for moving forward on action plans developed with UNICEF’s support and are applauding UNICEF’s convening role in forging cooperation between various ministries and the private sector as a best practice coordination example, thereby strengthening the establishment of UNICEF as a highly respected convenor. The World Bank, swayed by the high quality of the offer developed with UNICEF’s support, has stepped in to ensure both the scaling up and sustainability of the new early childhood education models. The Ministry of Education decided to scale up several initiatives developed with UNICEF’s technical support to the national level, ranging from the use of tools for the identification of learning disabilities and students at risk of dropping out to the training on hygiene practices in schools and the decision to use the regional educational plans as the basis for the next five-year national educational plan.
As an example, the partnership and dialogue with the World Bank has enabled the design and scaling up of programmes including capacity building and jointly strengthening  the early childhood education (ECE), the education and the social protection systems. UNICEF’s careful, albeit cumbersome and time-intensive, investment in strengthening the early childhood education system, in cooperation with all key stakeholders from the Government, civil society and the private sector, enabled a real break-through for the sector. The sustainability of UNICEF’s work on the development of the curriculum for the pre-primary, the in-service training of teachers from both the public and private sectors, the development of a bachelor’s degree for professionals in ECE and the modelling of standards for preschool classes – is now guaranteed for scaling up through the World Bank’s new “Programme de Renforcement des Fondations pour l'Apprentissage en Tunisie” (PREFAT) to the Tunisian Government.  These important break-throughs were made possible through UNICEF’s commitment to deliver evidence-based inclusive policy dialogue and quality programming, pro-actively investing in sharing its research findings and methodologies and availing its technical expertise. Tunisia Country Office (TCO) therefore sees this experience as an important lesson learned to keep investing in its partnerships to further results for children.
The partnership with the World Bank was also furthered through UNICEF’s advocacy which helped moving the policy dialogue with the Government forward. This ultimately resulted in the Government’s and Parliament adopting and approving respectively of the World Bank’s PREFAT programme. UNICEF’s participation in the development of the design of this programme ensured the inclusion of UNICEF’s work on ECE and Education and the used of the recommendation of the ECE fiscal space study supported by UNICEF.
UNICEF and the World Bank’s further joined forces by making financial and technical expertise available for the design of a common approach for the establishment of a universal cash grant for children.  Whilst the Government recognized the need for reforms in the subsidies, UNICEF’s message that the potential negative impact of the phasing out of these subsidies on the most vulnerable households could be mitigated through the gradual introduction of a universal child allowance was not really heard. The World Bank was however very sensitive to this argument and their backing for this approach, together with UNICEF’s fiscal space study which provided further evidence, enabled a full turn-around by decision makers including the Ministry in Charge of Reforms, and full acceptance of the positive impact a cash transfer for children could have for all households, especially the most vulnerable. It is important for UNICEF to recognize that it would not have been able to achieve this on its own. By the end of 2019, the Government submitted to Parliament a draft law for the creation of a social protection floor including a cash grant for children.
In terms of constraints, despite the establishment of the UN Portal by UNICEF in 2019, the anticipated increased cooperation on the programmatic side with civil society organisations did not concretise. NGOs especially national and local have find it difficult to use the portal when responding to calls for proposal due to the level of details and documentation  required and language barrier on one hand . Anothe explanation is that local civil society organisations do not have a large capacity to implement large projects. TCO has decided to take advantage of the external evaluation of the country programme to ensure close attention to improving this in 2020.
Procurement has been identified as a challenge across the UN system in Tunisia. To help address this, a Business Operation’s Strategy has been put in place in 2019. Within TCO, which significantly increased its size of operations and did not have a strong previous experience in procurement of services, a lot of tensions, mis-communication and mis-understanding appeared between teams, resulting in delays in implementation. It was recognised for the need to improve: clarity on roles and responsibilities; the monitoring and updating of the supply plan; staff to complete mandatory course on procurement and bring colleagues on stretch assignments. Better preparedness for peak procurement of services was further identified as well as anticipating external factors (i.e. reduced working hours during summer).
In terms of recruitment, TCO, along with other UNCT members encountered difficulties in the fulfilling national staff positions, contract duration being a factor influencing the decision.  The use of UN Volunteers was identified as a successful avenue to be further pursued, but more work is required to help ensure the added value is clear for the volunteers and the existing teams.

MENAR,Yemen,Lessons Learned and Innovations," 
 
Key Constraints 
Three overarching constraints hindered UNICEF programming across sectors: access constraints and  security concerns; limited operational partners; and lack of reliable data.
Access constraints and security concerns: To leave no child behind it is essential for all children to be reached with services. Humanitarian access and projects clearances mostly in the North continued to be restricted by all parties to the conflict and by civilian authorities. Of the 24.1 million  people that needed assistance, approximately 5 million (including 2.4 million children) lived in districts with access constraints. Security and safety of humanitarian staff continued to be a major concern, particularly in the North. From August to September alone, a total of 84 separate incidents of  incidents of assault, intimidations, arbitrary detention and other forms of mistreatment were reported along with theft and looting of relief supplies[9].
Limited partner capacity: In health, a high turnover of government staff and frequent mobility of health workers in local government areas and facilities required rebuilding capacity for health service delivery. In WASH there were limited partners to scale-up the programme. As a result, UNICEF has taken responsibility of over 75 per cent reach which also includes interventions of solid waste management. To improve this situation, UNICEF Yemen worked through local government area facilitators to provide in-service training and capacity building.
Lack of financial assistance in public sector remained a challenge as the government officials in social sectors continued services without regular salaries for the last 3 years. Although the Internationally Recognized Government resumed some salary payments to civil servants based in northern governorates in 2019, these were still incomplete, inconsistent, and as of early 2020 it is unclear whether they will continue.
Lack of reliable data: Due to a series of constraints, including restrictions in conducting independent assessment and monitoring, the humanitarian response to the crisis continued to suffer from a major lack of information, leading to inefficiencies in the design and targeting of humanitarian aid. Quality of data was also a major issue. Quality of epidemiological data from the Ministry of Public Health and Population led to most of the reported cholera cases being AWD cases. Significant efforts have been made by UNICEF and partners to address these information gaps using feasible and alternative data collection instruments. At the same  time, there is a significant amount of programme related information available, particularly at the decentralized level, but this has not been analysed sufficiently. During the last quarter of 2019, UNICEF Yemen developed an information management strategy to address these issues. The strategy will be fully implementing in 2020.
Risk Management 
As part of its regular audit calendar for its programmes and corporate approach to risk, UNICEF’s Office of Internal Audit and Investigations (OIAI) conducted an audit of UNICEF’s Yemen operations in March and April 2019, covering the period from January 2017 to March 2019. The audit report was officially released in November 2019. One of the key recommendations was the urgent need to better manage risks arising from partnerships in the high risk environment such as Yemen. The office’s use of the harmonized approach to cash transfer (HACT) assurance activities was not considered fit for purpose. As a result, from 1 November 2019, the risk profiles of all implementing partners were considered high risk until new enhanced ‘HACT-plus’ assessments re-establish the risk levels and appropriate funding modalities are applied accordingly. In the meantime, UNICEF will only be using direct payment and re-imbursement modalities for all implementing partners. Further, all recurrent and scheduled payments are being directed for disbursement through the Amman-based Programme Management Unit (PMU). This measure applies to both INGOs/NGOs/CSOs and government entities.
UNICEF Yemen was fully HACT compliant. However, years of active conflict in Yemen have impacted governance, accountability and transparency structures. UNICEF’s own programme scaled up rapidly in response to the urgent humanitarian needs from an annual budget of US$ 100 million in 2014 to a budget of US$ 879.5 million in 2019.  Given the numerous complexities on the ground, key internal controls and risk management mechanisms were not as strong and fit for purpose as they should have been. The above mentioned measures were therefore taken to strengthen risk management.
Prior to the release of the audit report, and in complement, the UNICEF Yemen Office was already undergoing  programmatic and operational changes following an in-depth internal programme review conducted from April to August 2019. YCO has already started implementing all these shifts including moving from system preservation to system strengthening particularly in the health (e.g. performance-based financing), education (e.g. infrastructure through GPE funding) and water sectors (e.g. solarisation). The review resulted in 9 key strategic programme and operational shifts:

Transitional approach from system preservation to system strengthening.
Shift towards prioritization of interventions to focus on quality of assistance –  balance of at scale and targeted.
Integrate better risk-informed planning into the programme.
Significantly scale-up (appropriate) data collection and analysis.
Improve targeting and intensify actions to access hard-to-reach populations
Strengthen multisectoral programming.
Embed management of all periodic cash and voucher transfers within the PMU.
Increase focus on second generation programming
Gradually reposition C4D as a programme strategy rather than standalone programme.
Human Resource Challenges: In recruitment, attracting women candidates and industrial country candidates remained a challenge due to culture issues for national staff and security issues for international staff. Also, arranging visa for the international staff (IP) remained a constant challenge during the year 2019. It resulted in large number of vacant posts to be filled. By end December 2019, YCO had 40 per cent female staff and 60 per cent male staff with 24 per cent of IP staff from donor countries and 76 per cent from programme Countries.

"
SAR,Afghanistan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Upon careful review of the results achieved over the year, theories of change in the strategy notes were seen to be credible and remain valid. However, readjustments to programme implementation were made based on foreseen and unforeseen events in Afghanistan.
Innovative Approaches
Creative programming in unpredictable settings: In the unpredictable operating environment of Afghanistan, UNICEF followed a ‘risk-informed programming’ approach to adapt programmes to rapidly meet the needs of populations affected by conflict and disasters. In response to the ban on house-to-house visits for polio vaccinations, the programme found a way to adapt by implementing the innovative site-to-site and facility-to-facility campaign strategy. National bans are also impacting Vitamin A supplementation, and an alternative approach whereby supplements are integrated in routine services is now being explored.
The shortage of Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food is being addressed by new protocols that revise its dosage and thereby make it possible to reach maximum children with the nutrients they need to recover. The education programme is moving from facility-based to flexible modalities such as the Community Based Education to bring education to out-of-school children in remote areas. In this way, a key lesson learned in the year was the need for re-prioritization, where necessary, of UNICEF funds, staff and supplies to ensure no child is left behind.
Innovative use of available resources: The Afghanistan Country Office continues to face constraints in generating enough funds to address the huge needs. There is a need to make more strategic investments into high-yielding, cost-effective and sustainable interventions. A long-term investment in drought resistant water supply facilities had multiple benefits; it removed short-term fixes like water trucking, provided access to safe water supply to adjoining communities, reduced the number of IDPs in search of safe water services and allowed humanitarian resources to be utilized for other durable solutions. Meanwhile, investing in solar-powered water supply systems is another cost-effective strategy in addition to being climate friendly and sustainable.
Streamline Service Provision: An important innovation that improved service provision and management of diarrhoea, a disease that is a major contributor of child mortality in Afghanistan, was the introduction of co-packaged ORS and Zinc. Both items are critical to diarrhoea management, and both have traditionally been provided separately. This simple act of co-packaging supplemented with awareness raising campaigns increased the utilization of Zinc and ORS by four folds in a span of three years (9.6 per cent in 2015 to 36.6 per cent in 2018). A formal evaluation of this programme is planned for 2020, for eventual commercialization, thereby fostering potential UNICEF-private partnerships.
Community Empowerment: Community engagement and participation is fundamental to UNICEF Afghanistan’s implementation strategy. The success of the Community Led Total Sanitation in leading to the declaration of five districts as open defecation free in 2019 is evidence for this.  One novel idea that helped to limit the burden on both UNICEF and government personnel was in the capacity building of mothers to recognize early signs of malnutrition in children through measurement of the child’s Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC). Over 15,000 mothers and caregivers were trained in three districts in Herat and equipped with MUAC tapes, measurement and referral skills, resulting in an increase of 220 per cent in admissions for treatment of Severe Acute Malnutrition.
Lessons Learned
There are lessons to be learned from a more strategic use of limited personnel. For instance, it is often more efficient to build on synergies and strengths of a workforce from other programmes, especially in the same geographic areas. In one instance, modules on best parenting practices were added to the training courses for community-based mobile health teams, Child Friendly Space facilitators, and teachers in IDP communities, who have the potential to reach over 300,000 people with parenting messages. In another instance, non-emergency personnel from existing government structures, including social workers, were redirected to serve displaced populations during the emergency response to drought. Similarly, social workers, police officers, CPAN members were all reassigned for emergency response on need basis. However, this approach put a strain on government personnel; a challenge that was mitigated when the process was revised so government workers assessed and referred people and then contracted NGOs for specialized services.
Increased integration: There is a strong case for increased integration between programmes, not just because it reduces the burden on resources, but also because it yields high returns. For instance, the provision of WASH services in polio high-risk areas will help to stop the transmission of the virus from contaminated water sources. The C4D unit designed a programme whereby kindergartens were used as platforms to disseminate messages on health, nutrition and WASH behaviours, as well as forming a stepping stone for Early Childhood Development programming. After the March 2019 floods, it was found that a series of siloed response activities were taking place with no coordination between humanitarian partners. To mitigate this in the future, an Emergency Preparedness and Response training on integrated services for emergency preparedness and response was organized, after which, Emergency Preparedness Plans underpinned by integrated response measures were prepared.
Strategic communication: Having famous personalities, local influencers and community leaders take on the advocacy messages for children’s rights significantly aided awareness raising, demand generation and resource mobilization. The First Lady’s involvement not only helped to break cultural taboos around menstruation, but also brought five line ministries together to deliberate the national rollout of Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) guidelines. After this, the first ever MHM guideline and promotion packages were translated to local languages and disseminated across 22 provinces. To carry awareness raising interventions forward, there is an opportunity here to hold trainings for teachers and female members of religious organizations to act as MHM champions and disseminate MHM and hygiene messages. A key lesson learned during the year is that stakeholders, community members and donors alike, must be engaged through the entire cycle of programming, and not just at key events and at certain points in time to not lose momentum at any point.

SAR,Bangladesh,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons learned
A high level of out-of-pocket expenditure (72 per cent) combined with a very low budget allocation for health (0.76 per cent of GDP) creates financial barriers to accessing health services for Bangladeshi families. UNICEF will support the analysis of health financing in the context of universal health coverage and facilitate discussions between the MoHFW, Ministry of Finance and Cabinet of Bangladesh.
Capacity building for KMC has been shifted to the district level using local facilitators, and community-level capacity building for comprehensive newborn care will be supported. It may be possible to leverage the Community-Based Health Care operational plan to scale up and improve community health programmes for MNCH. The Quality, Equity, Dignity initiative is being scaled up based on learnings from Kurigram district, building a system for quality improvement, with district plans and learning hub, through the partnership with the National Institute of Preventive and Social Medicine.
Although ECD is now well rooted in policy, a strong commitment to its institutionalization through ministry coordination will enhance various programmes and ensure proper integration of holistic child development.
The strong focus on ending child marriage has reduced focus on other harmful practices against children. Although child marriage remains at unacceptably high levels in Bangladesh, it is necessary to find a more balanced approach that simultaneously addresses other harmful practices.
Systems strengthening and capacity building are continuous processes that require sustained effort over time. It is critical to have a strategic and adequately resourced long-term plan when initiating any approaches or interventions. Actively engaging young people in exploring solutions to the problems they face is also crucial; respect for their views and insights can contribute to the sustainability of solutions.
A holistic approach that engages all community members (e.g., men, boys) is also vital for social norm change. A key lesson relates to the need to ensure advertising and promotional budgets to increase the reach of media programmes, especially in a saturated market like Bangladesh. This is crucial if results are to be generated at scale. Robust research is necessary to clearly define the aims and intended results of media initiatives.
Capacity building of child protection actors at all levels and advocacy for a strengthened child protection system and response at national, divisional and local levels will be important areas of focus in 2020. It will also be important to further harness the power of evidence to drive change – by building the evidence base on adolescents for better programming. UNICEF will also continue efforts to strengthen coordination between MoHFW and MoPME and build the capacity of the two ministries on adolescent nutrition programmes at secondary schools. MoWCA will be supported on adolescent nutrition interventions for adolescent clubs.
Digital platforms represent an incredible opportunity to raise awareness of and engagement with child rights, but stringent cost-benefit analysis is needed to better prioritize investments in digital activities. UNICEF must secure the most cost-effective means of engaging with the most disadvantaged children and families across digital platforms to increase accessibility for target beneficiaries.
Implementing the development programme while continuing to support the humanitarian response to the Rohingya crisis remains a significant challenge. While progress has been made in integrating the humanitarian and development programmes, the urgency of humanitarian needs continues to distract attention from development efforts. There is a need to improve complementarity to achieve outputs without compromising either programme.
With the next CPD in development, it is crucial to ensure that cross-cutting areas are more strongly reflected within the programme cycle, both to protect the significant progress to date and to establish clear plans to scale up positive impacts. UNICEF’s priorities should also be included within the GoB’s next five-year plan, and UNICEF will undertake significant work in 2020 to ensure that key issues are adequately reflected and planned for. To fully realize UNICEF’s outcome objectives, a continued focus on the many innovative partnerships established must be maintained and further supported at the highest levels of the country office. Efforts to support Bangladesh’s resiliency to climate change should similarly be prioritized throughout the remainder of the current CPD and in the development of the next.
 
Innovations
The e-tracker for child immunization and maternal health within the DHIS2 platform, developed with UNICEF support, will be scaled up and the online micro-plans and real-time data monitoring systems will be used during the 2020 measles-rubella campaign. Involving senior obstetricians in PMTCT gave junior service providers the confidence to handle HIV-positive cases and work to reduce stigma and discrimination.  A new technology for crude salt harvesting has been successful in producing high-quality salt, and a web-based management information system for the Salt Mill Owners Association is functional.
The planned curriculum reform began as business as usual, with primary and secondary levels of the education system developing distinct curriculum frameworks managed by two separate NCTB sections. UNICEF then took the initiative to initiate discussions, including with the chairman of NCTB, on the merit of a comprehensive approach. The process led to the country’s first comprehensive curriculum framework and also to stronger relationships within NCTB.
Similarly, engaging adolescents in the design of SRHR education entirely changed the intervention. An e-learning course is now being co-created with adolescents to see the effects and impact on learning, and this innovation project will be a priority in 2020.
The successful SanMarkS project will be extended with support from the World Bank and the private sector, with the aim of motivating 12 million people to obtain basic sanitation by 2030.
In 2019, UNICEF supported the GoB to celebrate Global Handwashing Day, as part of the implementation of the ‘three-star approach’ to WASH in schools in 72 schools (30 primary, 42 secondary), with schools encouraged to report on handwashing events via U-Report, fostering innovation in programming and advocacy for children. Updates on participation were broadcast live at a national event attended by policymakers: 7.5 million children from 59,600 primary schools took part. The event demonstrated that handwashing at every school is possible using existing resources and the model can be used as part of the ‘three-star approach’ to WASH in schools. Menstrual Hygiene Day supported advocacy for age-appropriate MHM content in primary education.
Adolescent participation has been enhanced and taken to scale using innovative, community-based platforms including radio listener clubs, adolescent clubs and Community-Based Child Protection Committees. End Child Marriage messaging on multimedia and social media platforms had over 150 million views in 2019, and the UNICEF U-Report platform engaged over 280,000 adolescents in Bangladesh. An online monitoring system was developed to monitor effectiveness of adolescent clubs. Some 525,000 adolescents engaged in civic and policy discussions with parliamentarians through the Generation Parliament initiative – used by UNICEF to win support for the cause of children from decision-makers and the wider public in collaboration with the International Labour Organization, access to information (a2i), and Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC).
Operations led several innovative approaches in 2019 to achieve cost savings and support efficient programme delivery and collaboration across teams and locations. UNICEF Bangladesh attained 100 per cent coverage of videoconferencing equipment installation in 2019, inclusive of all field offices, saving on travel time and costs for meetings. The country office continued to ‘green the blue’ with a print-on-demand initiative that saved about 360,000 sheets of paper in 2019 – equivalent to 48 trees, 9,000 litres of water and 20,500 kWh of energy. UNICEF Bangladesh continues to promote collaboration and productivity, by migrating all its document management platforms into the enterprise content management platform and developing a new communication site within it. This ‘one-stop shop’ for inter-office collaboration, knowledge sharing, communication, key business tools and ICON will enhance staff efficiency – a good example of using versatile, safe and secure knowledge and information systems to enable change. Furthermore, the country office extended the communication site to other United Nations agencies as part of supply and logistics inter-agency knowledge and information sharing, both to manage long-term agreements and to support the Global Education Cluster in the Rohingya response.

SAR,Bhutan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"GOAL AREA 1: EVERY CHILD SURVIVES AND THRIVES
Innovation: The introduction of micronutrient powder (MNP) was piloted to address micronutrient deficiency among children. About 70 health workers were trained for the pilot. The pilot’s assessment revealed that care-giver’s compliance with MNP was significant at 96.4 percent, early initiation of breastfeeding increased from 77 to 94 percent, continued breastfeeding increased from 74 to 91 percent, meal frequency increased from 78 to 89 percent, and dietary diversity including vitamin A rich fruits and vegetables increased from 43 to 55 percent. Care-giver’s knowledge on the use of micronutrient powder was very high with 97 percent knowing the correct schedule.
Innovation: ECCD is expanding at a rapid pace but with limited national expertise in ECCD, many challenges are arising related to effective and efficient use of district-level resources. For example, capacity development of facilitators and other stakeholders, if conducted at the national level, is a major concern due to acute human and financial resource constraints. To address this concern, UNICEF supported a national Training of Trainers on Parenting Education in 2018, which has facilitated the nationwide rollout of parenting education training in 2019 at district level. This innovative, decentralized approach to Parenting Education training has amplified the outreach to all districts and municipalities at a reduced cost this year. Through this approach, UNICEF supported the MoE in ensuring that all 582 facilitators (536 female) in community-based ECCD centres are trained on parenting education. To support the development of the alternative models for ECCD as only one in every four preschool-aged children has access to early learning and to ensure that enrolment will achieve the target of 50 percent by 2023, UNICEF supported an innovative approach to develop 24 (17 female) mobile facilitators training in ECCD.
GOAL AREA 2: EVERY CHILD LEARNS
Lesson learned: A lesson learned in 2019 is that programmes for adolescents particularly focusing on skills and employability may be required in the next Annual Work Plan. Since skills and jobs are constantly changing, it would be essential to equip children with 21st century skills through secondary education. To address this youth skills crisis in Bhutan, the government, private sector, and International Organizations must increase the level of engagement with young people and scale-up sustainable solutions. A lesson learned in 2019 was that skill-building interventions need to help young people to be: digitally literate; able to critically think through complex problems; and able to work and communicate across diverse teams.
Innovation: To provide equal opportunities for children with profound deafness, UNICEF continues to provide technical support to ‘Wangsel Institute for the Deaf’ to develop Bhutan’s first ever national Sign Language system, enabling more than 100 deaf children (45 female) to access education using more standardized sign language. A separate curriculum for Wangsel Institute is being finalized.
GOAL AREA 3: EVERY CHILD IS PROTECTED FROM VIOLENCE AND EXPLOITATION
Lesson learned: With multiple agencies-government, CSOs and UN involved in prevention and response to gender-based violence (GBV), a lesson learned was the need for a standardized operating procedure (SOP) on GBV which defines the roles and responsibilities of each agencies and thereby, improve the services for survivors of GBV. UNICEF brought together four UN agencies to develop the SOP on GBV which has been used to train front liners and case managers from government and CSOs.
Innovation: UNICEF has been working with five national partners to increase the knowledge and skills of children and young people on prevention of and response to violence against children. As an innovative approach to increase the reach, in 2019 UNICEF engaged with the Youth Bhutan Network and built the capacities of youth group members. As a result, these youth groups were able to create awareness to additional 5,493 (2,929 female) adolescents and young people on violence against children.
Innovation: As part of an ongoing innovation, the Integrated Youth-friendly Service Centres were upgraded to include new services such as entrepreneurship education and computer coding and programming. Besides formal education in schools, marginalized groups and out-of-school children can be provided with informal learning opportunities through such centres.
GOAL AREA 4: EVERY CHILD LIVES IN A SAFE AND CLEAN ENVIRONMENT
Innovation: An innovative MoU between the MoE, Religion and Health Project of the Central Monastic Body together with UNICEF and the Bhutan Toilet Organization (BTO). This partnership enhanced access to clean toilets through installation of Safe Toilet (SATO) technology provided by Lixil giving 16,896 children (8,032 girls) in 50 schools (2019 target was 40 schools) and 1,410 monks in 26 monastic institutions (target was 30 monastic institutions) access to clean toilets.
GOAL AREA 5: EVERY CHILD HAS AN EQUITABLE CHANCE IN LIFE
Lesson learned: The certificate course on Social Policy was delivered for the 4th Cohort mainly focusing on the Parliamentarians, mid-level programme managers and programme manager from the civil societies. With the decentralization of 12th Five Year Plan and 50 percent of the budget which needs to be planned and used at the local level, a lesson learned is that the course will need to be customized to build the capacity of the local government at the district level to build their understanding on policy development, policy analysis and Result Based Management. The course curriculum will be reviewed to fit the needs of local government counterparts.
Lesson learned: The 2013 Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis of the Monitoring and Evaluation System in Bhutan showed that there is very weak evaluation culture in Bhutan. With limited local capacity in the country, a lesson learned is that the Evaluation Association of Bhutan will need to network with other similar global and regional networks to be able to build its own capacity as well as advocate and train local evaluators on the need for high quality evaluations. UNICEF Bhutan will need to support and leverage such platforms for the newly established Evaluation Association of Bhutan as part of its National Evaluation Capacity Building Plan.
"
SAR,India,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Three critical points were noted in 2019:
1. Evidence and monitoring frameworks are vital for results-based programming
In order to enhance efficiency and impact of existing cash transfer programmes for girls, it is important to invest in systems to operationalize and improve access to complementary services. UNICEF has provided technical support to state governments to build monitoring information systems to ensure that no child falls through the cracks. On evidence generation, consistent and multidimensional efforts are required to convince policy makers about the importance of the right data at the right time.
Several health and nutrition programmes (e.g. POSHAN Abhiyaan, home-based care for young children, Anemia Mukt Bharat) were strengthened through taking a more result-based approach. This included a focus on improving the ‘building blocks’ (supplies, financing, demand generation, governance, M&E, service delivery) of systems by government and development partners. This is changing the mindset of government partners at all levels to focus on improving coverage and quality. Continued advocacy and leadership, including a much stronger focus on programme-convergent target setting and monitoring, will be needed to guide implementation.
2. Importance of Continued Advocacy as an enabler for results
Although the number of out-of-school children in states is under-reported, experience has shown that continuous advocacy at different levels will eventually bear fruit. In the states with the most out-of-school children (Uttar Pradesh and Bihar), UNICEF’s advocacy has led to the state governments placing greater focus on this issue, resulting in more out-of-school children being identified and mainstreamed into schools and special training programmes than previously. In Uttar Pradesh, the state government has established the SHARDA programme; in Bihar, the government’s own community workers are now playing a more active role in identifying, mainstreaming and tracking out-of-school children.
In the WASH sector, our continued advocacy contributed to leveraging substantial resources for children and adolescent girls. For example, in menstrual hygiene management (MHM) programming, advocacy efforts through three consecutive national consultations with four nodal ministries, 12 state governments and NGOs have borne results: INR 746 million (some US$ 10.5 million) was mobilized for MHM interventions; a state-level MHM strategy was launched in Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh; and state action plans were rolled out in Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.
High quality evidence on sanitation programming supported advocacy efforts, resulting in significant resources (e.g. US$ 12.5 billion to extend the efforts to end open defecation to December 2024 and INR 2.33 billion (US$ 32.3 million) for school WASH from state governments) being leveraged.
These examples highlight the importance of strategic evidence generation and advocacy, including through partners, which remains an area of focus in 2020.
3. Innovation and technology platforms as an Enabler for Results 
In 2019, UNICEF consolidated its technology for development (T4D) portfolio across programmes to map the most common technology interventions. It was found that 25 per cent of all 70 projects use real-time monitoring of interventions. Such monitoring facilitates better data collection and decision-making for both UNICEF and government counterparts. UNICEF has invested in creating in-house real-time monitoring capability using RapidPro and ODK platforms to address this priority. UNICEF is also committed to using open-source technologies for its T4D projects and adhering to the metadata and data standards defined by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to facilitate efficient data exchange and information sharing.
Through U-Report India, adolescent and youth were engaged to provide feedback and data on cyberbullying and career aspirations; chatbots were used to create awareness and build knowledge of air pollution, disaster preparedness, child marriage/child rights, menstrual hygiene and breastfeeding. A total of 57,550 U-Reporter engagements were generated with 25 per cent female participation. India now has more than 328,000 U-Reporters, almost twice as many in December 2018 (163,000). The four states with the highest number of U-reports are Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Chhattisgarh; 80 per cent of U-Reporters are aged 15–30. India Country Office is part of the 11-country U-Report scale-up effort to reach 28 million young people globally by 2021. U-Report India, in collaboration with the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, has begun engagement with India’s largest student volunteer organization – the National Service Scheme, which has a network of 4.1 million student volunteers.
In the education sector, under the Diksha programme of the Ministry of Human Resource Development, UNICEF supported the review of textbooks, suggested enrichment of material and the use of codes. This would enable teachers to enhance the school teaching-learning experience by having digital access to enriched material linked to curricular content in textbooks. The career portal is another example of an online innovation that strengthens career guidance to better inform the transition from school to work. To date, 790,000 students (58 per cent girls) have actively engaged through support from 59,000 teachers trained how to use the portal. Online efforts are supported by offline engagement to facilitate holistic career guidance for students.
UNICEF piloted a social accountability monitoring system in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh through RapidPro, an open-source technology platform that collects direct feedback from rural respondents to inform district and state administrations on the sustainability of open-defecation-free initiatives. In partnership with Water.org, UNICEF promoted alternative credit models in Maharashtra through women’s self-help groups: 15,000 affordable WASH loans (amounting to INR 225 million – some US$ 3 million) were given with 95 per cent repayment rate, and the scheme is to be expanded to Madhya Pradesh and Bihar.
Given the ambitious nature of the government flagship water supply programme (Jal Jeevan Mission), UNICEF advocated a monitoring system based on the internet-of-things with a focus on quality, equity, sustainability, and documenting innovations for better transparency and accountability. All states have conducted GIS mapping of water supply schemes, which will serve as a baseline for the JJM roll out.
Innovative approaches such as app-based water sample collection and automatic SMS-based feedback on water quality parameters were scaled up in West Bengal, which in turn is used for social mobilization activities in arsenic- and fluoride-affected areas of West Bengal.
"
SAR,Maldives,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons Learned 
High level advocacy in 2019 demonstrated the positive results attained through consistent and continued engagement with key stakeholders. Key achievements include the passing of new legislation and significant progress on previously passed policies and strategies for the advancement of child rights across the Maldives. This illustrates the importance of building trust and consistent engagement and has further motivated the Maldives team to build internal capacity on strategic advocacy and communication in 2020.  
While social media and online content is growing as a communication strategy, face-to-face sessions with parents to raise awareness around infant and young child feeding practices that promote healthy and well-nourished children remains critical. Feedback from 12 pilot sessions also showed that different approaches are required to increase attendance of fathers in the information sessions, which is something UNICEF Maldives will explore further in 2020.  
UNICEF supported the Ministry of Gender, Family, and Social Services with the continued rollout of the Community Social Groups (CSGs) to strengthen community child protection mechanisms. While the CSGs continue to be established in various islands, progress was slower than anticipated due to issues at both national and sub-national levels. With the amended Decentralization Act, the Local Government Authority (LGA) and its Local Councils will play an increasingly important role and have a closer partnership.  In 2020 the Councils will have a prioritized role in making the CSGs more effective and impactful and a comprehensive evaluation of the CSG system to assess their reach, functionality, and impact is planned for 2020 in order to learn from the first two years of implementation.
Key gains were made following the UNICEF-supported National Symposium on the Curriculum held in early 2019. Initial feedback on the national curriculum suggested that the content is not age appropriate and overloaded, and assessment systems are weak. Given the varying quality of teaching staff, particularly in remote islands, this will be an important consideration for 2020 to ensure that children and young people acquire the skills and knowledge needed for the future and to ensure that teachers are well-trained and supported by the system to fulfill their duties.
UNICEF encountered significant challenges in identifying out-of-school (OoSC) children and adolescents – particularly the identification of OoSC girls for the alternative learning pilot. There is a lack of reliable official data on this target group, as schools do not record these cases in the Maldives Education Management Information System (MEMIS). This will be an important element to strengthen in the MEMIs which is also supported by UNICEF.
UNICEF and Villa College observed that residential programmes are more effective than vocational training programmes in the young people’s community as most at-risk young people are more likely to respond when daily influences and distractions are removed. A comprehensive lesson learnt exercise will be conducted to document the various steps of the programme and assess areas that can be further improved or adjusted for future roll-out.
On the social media and communication side, the UNICEF Regional Office supported the Country Office with a “360” analysis of the public communication and engagements. UNICEF Maldives is in a unique position that with a limited budget the office could potentially reach every person in the country at least once with a message or engaging piece of content. While the analysis showed solid growth in engagements and reach compared to 2018, which is a testimony to more strategic investments in the social media, the analysis also provided specific recommendations which can help the office maximize its efforts, including more personal stories, videos, and more local Maldives related content.
Innovation
UNICEF Maldives Country Office is increasingly taking advantage of high mobile phone and internet coverage across the country to launch tech for development solutions and disseminate advocacy and awareness materials through various social media channels. The launch of the first-ever child nutrition app ‘Yagooth’ in conjunction with the new Social Behaviour Communication (SBCC) Strategy is one key example. Lessons are being documented for further improving the app in 2020, including how to increase engagement and two-way communication. Initial feedback from the mobile app users indicates that there is demand for more resources and a dynamic interface, as well as information provided in both English and Dhivehi (the local language).=
UNICEF piloted the first ever alternative education programme (ALP) for vulnerable adolescents, which offered a water sports trainee and mentoring programme. The programme was initiated in partnership with Maldives Red Crescent and benefited a total of 25 at-risk children including 23 young boys and two girls who were given a second chance to develop basic literacy skills, acquire core life-skill competencies, and enrol in skills-development programmes such as water sports and electric wiring. By the end of 2019, 13 out of 20 of the water sports students have been able to extend their initial 3-month internship, while three have been successful in securing a long-term contract with a resort. Important lessons have been drawn from the initial pilot project that will further shape a scale-up.
UNICEF supported the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) to strengthen the national statistical information management systems by updating the MaldivInfo database to the latest technological standards and transforming it into a data-for-all platform with an accompanying mobile application. MaldivInfo platform is now aligned with the SDGs and data on children is now easily accessible. The next step will be to update the national SDG indicators to make monitoring appropriate for the country context, and to link MaldivInfo to other data sources such as the education information management system and the health data information system. This will provide real-time data and allow for efficient analysis using key data sources. 
UNICEF Maldives launched three innovative partnerships with the private sector to give young people the opportunity to explore future career options and build critical skills. Six young people including three boys and three girls will benefit from a 3-month internship with Manta Air in the coming year, while around 7 trainees from Noonu Atoll will benefit from a 12-month traineeship programme with the Movenpick resort in Noonu Atoll in 2020. These partnerships are the first of their kind and with many more young people eager to be introduced to the job market, UNICEF will continue to expand these innovative partnerships to promote training and learning opportunities for young girls and boys across the Maldives.
"
SAR,Nepal,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The Country Programme’s equity focus within the broader framework of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) cross-cutting priority on “Leaving no one behind”, aims to support the new municipal governments to reach all parts of their communities with child-friendly services. To achieve this, the current Country Programme focus is on 50 priority rural and urban municipalities, in addition to support at the federal level. Priority municipalities were selected based on the level of child deprivation and geographic location. UNICEF supports municipal governments as they strengthen their capacity and governance to deliver child-friendly services through providing technical assistance and best practice examples during the municipal government planning and budgeting processes. In 2019, UNICEF supported all 50 municipalities to develop their annual plans and budgets, resulting in an increased focus on children in allocation municipal resources.
One major enabling factor in this achievement has been the advent of the federal structure. Federalism has meant greater engagement with local officials and has resulted in support being provided directly to government officials responsible for implementation. The result has been a noticeable improvement in the accountability, responsiveness and effectiveness of government plans and budgets due to the transition to Federalism.
While the programme’s innovative, rights-based approach has been successful in supporting the initial stages of the federalization process and in influencing concrete action for children at municipal and provincial levels, programme implementation to date has also highlighted challenges related to the human resource and financial cost of providing intensive support across 50 highly diverse and geographically dispersed municipalities. UNICEF’s challenges arise from limited human resources, in addition to the lack of earmarked donor funding to sustain and fund this important effort.  The upcoming mid-term review will undertake a thorough review of the approach, taking into account the baseline carried out in 2019 as well as the broader and the UNICEF specific capacity needs assessment.
 
Learning from the 2019 flood response:
In 2019 floods affected parts of the Terai region in Nepal. These floods exposed several shortcomings in data collection and management within the existing cluster mechanism. The primary problem arose from the lack of coordinated baseline data availability. Proxies were used to ensure that the impact of the flood could be effectively measured. However, while systems for data preparedness has been scaled-up in recent years, including by the Index for Risk Management (INFORM) process and cluster assessments, gaps remain. For example, challenges for clusters in interpreting pre-crisis data and extrapolating relevant preparedness and emergency response interventions for the populations in need. The effect of this was felt the most in the nutrition sector, with data on child nutritional status hard to separate from pre-existing nutrition challenges and deterioration due to flooding.
The key lesson from this experience was the need for greater levels of cooperation and preparedness on pre-crisis data gathering and benchmarking among Government, UN agencies and other cluster partners, especially for the preparedness and data management for the geographic areas that are often affected by flooding and other natural disasters. As disasters occur with regularity in these areas it is both appropriate and best practice to proactively gather data annually before the onset of the monsoon season. For UNICEF this data would pertain primarily to children, in order to be able to identify the specific impact a flood has on the children in that area.
To address this lesson, UNICEF and the UN system have created a new, inter-agency, preparedness programme. This has identified a series of outputs that are essential to ensure the highest level of disaster preparedness can take place. These include: (i) a joint analysis of the humanitarian concerns that are most likely to need addressing through preparedness and response actions. (ii) A defined and agreed list of essential minimum preparedness actions. (iii) defined and agreed parameters for cash-based interventions and division of responsibility. Finally, a comprehensive monitoring and learning framework must be established in order to measure and understand the effectiveness of the preparedness actions and the corresponding reduction in humanitarian needs.
UNICEF is playing an active and ongoing role in the development, management and implementation of this programme and anticipates significant improvements in the reduction of disaster risk among vulnerable children and the Nepali communities.
"
SAR,Pakistan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"As UNICEF approaches the mid-term review of its Country Programme, its theories of change continue to drive progress towards results for children, with opportunities to accelerate results emerging from long-term engagement with government partners, multisectoral integration, and innovative communication. Challenges included weak coordination and use of evidence, limited capacity among government and implementing partners, and varying degrees of capacity and political will in devolved provincial administrations.
Lessons learned
1.    Building market demand and linking it to government priorities while strengthening supply is critical to successful private sector engagement.
In 2019, UNICEF engaged with businesses to demonstrate the estimated US$2.8 billion market for low-cost sanitation products to achieve Pakistan’s target of eliminating open defecation. Exploring this market was a new concept for many manufacturers.
UNICEF advocacy with Government to include new pneumonia medicines on the essential medicines list, and with private healthcare providers, was critical to ensuring supply from domestic manufacturers. A similar approach was taken for ready-to-use therapeutic food, where UNICEF engaged with provincial nutrition cells as buyers and with manufacturers for quality certification to take advantage of the expanding space for nutrition.
2.    Long-term advocacy, alignment with government processes and incremental support positioned UNICEF to leverage political momentum when the moment arose.
When the Prime Minister’s C&GP movement was launched, UNICEF had already laid the groundwork for sub-national administrations to move quickly to drive child-centred, equity-focused WASH policies and plans. Aligning UNICEF-supported processes, such as Joint Sector Reviews, with government budgeting cycles ensured concrete WASH commitments, and helped policymakers understand needs and advocate for allocations.
A key challenge in earlier education sector planning had been translating five-year plans into government operational plans. As GPE Coordinating Agency, UNICEF built a strong understanding of on-the-ground government planning and financial processes across provinces as a foundation for the introduction of a planning lifecycle approach to support provincial ESP development. This support package included strong coordination, anchoring planning processes in the appropriate units of education departments and developing capacity of planning officials. The next stage will include tailored guidelines linking ESPs with annual operational and development planning, and technical assistance to shift towards output-based planning and implementation, in Sindh and GB. This approach aligned ESPs with real-life planning processes while enhancing official capacity to implement and monitor them.
3.    Packages of integrated interventions yield sustainable results.
Setbacks to polio eradication led to programme-wide reflections. Over 78 per cent of polio cases in 2012–2019 had not received routine immunizations and came from communities with multiple deprivations. Growing fatigue amongst marginalized families about receiving polio vaccination (but not other social services) pointed to a need to strengthen integrated services. Within UNICEF, a 2019 evaluation of a successful stunting reduction programme suggested that while nutrition and WASH interventions had converged, even better results could have been achieved with greater integration. With these learnings, UNICEF supported the design of fully integrated health, nutrition and WASH services with a strong integrated C4D component. This was piloted in two union councils with promising early results and influenced Government and partners to prioritise integrated services as a core strategy in the 40 super-high-risk union councils where polio is endemic.
Innovations
Creative C4D and social media use, enhancing demand and crisis communication.
For the TCV campaign, creative engagement with communities aimed to help children be change-makers by providing school activity packs and an Android game that received a 5/5 user rating on the Google Play Store. There were anecdotal reports of children arguing for improved hygiene practices at home, and user requests to broaden the game to include other health messages. A Facebook Chatbot was piloted as a low-cost alternative to telephone helplines for concerned parents, causing engagement to spike from a monthly average of six messages to over 100 in two weeks. Targeted message boosting increased followers of the Expanded Programme for Immunization Facebook page from 4,734 (48 per cent women) to over 20,000 people (52 per cent women).
Social media was an important arena for crisis communication following an anti-vaccination scare which raised negative sentiment around TCV to 14 per cent. UNICEF acted swiftly to correct misconceptions by convincing those who had disseminated the original scare-story to issue retractions. This reduced negative sentiment to 5 per cent within two days, contributing to 99 per cent campaign coverage. Similar measures will be implemented for the Punjab TCV campaign in 2020.
Interpersonal communication was critical to HIV response in Sindh. UNICEF’s equity-focused package included the establishment of two HIV units to bring services to impoverished families who could not afford to travel. Stigma was reduced through teams which visited villages regularly to persuade mothers to be tested, connect affected families with HIV units, and monitor adherence to antiretroviral therapy. This approach underpinned the success of the immediate response, and UNICEF is now working with government to sustain it so affected children receive lifelong treatment.
Looking ahead
In 2020, UNICEF will continue to work with governments to shift political will and integrate child-focused interventions into government planning structures. The lessons learned from 2019 will feed into the Midterm Review of the Country Programme in 2020.
Integrated service delivery in super high-risk union councils will be a major part of UNICEF support for polio eradication.
The communication innovations that contributed to the success of the Sindh TCV campaign will inform the 2020 campaign in Punjab.
As the rollout of Ehsaas and C&GP continue, UNICEF will build on the momentum generated in 2019 towards equitable child-focused policies. The favourable policy environment will be leveraged to drive forward child poverty measurement and the finalization of a monitoring and evaluation framework for Ehsaas. UNICEF will continue to respond strategically to the needs of adolescents, building on the emerging GenU partnership.
Private sector engagement, including for supply chain will continue. In 2020, UNICEF intends to work with manufacturers to explore production of quality RUTF using locally-grown chickpeas instead of imported peanuts.
UNICEF will support development of the national ECD framework and rollout the parenting package, with integrated C4D, so that marginalized families use these services for children.

SAR,Sri Lanka,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"1. The roll-out of RBM4ISD offers critical lessons for other offices. 
Sri Lanka faces persistent systemic bottlenecks affecting the implementation of policies and programmes to eliminate child deprivations and reduce the long-term consequences of multidimensional poverty. Given the state has the resources to make the greatest impact on children (UNICEF contributes only 0.06 per cent of the national budget), it is critical that issues such as ineffective planning and monitoring, leading to poorly formulated budgets with minimal opportunities for civic engagement, are addressed.
Sri Lanka was the first country to pilot RBM4ISD, with provincial and national government partners. RBM4ISD aims to strengthen government performance management systems to ensure public services are delivered efficiently, effectively and equitably, by maintaining a focus on results, not inputs.
A good practice and a lesson for other countries planning to roll out RBM4ISD is that government must demand for and be committed to this approach, and UNICEF has a key role to play in creating that demand.
For this, UNICEF first built capacity of its own staff on results-based management. They then shared tools and learning with government partners at critical times in the programme cycle. This real-time application showed how results-based management can enhance planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation.
Another important learning is that there should be commitment within the country office in advocating for RBM4ISD and demonstrating its added value. UNICEF should play a convening role, bringing together actors at national and provincial levels, to identify common issues and solutions.
The response from engaged government partners, and their incorporation of key learnings into planning processes, was significant. However, institutionalization will require engagement at both national and provincial levels to gain traction and achieve sustainability. Sustained, long-term advocacy and technical support will be required to influence the enabling environment.
To roll out RBM4ISD, therefore, country offices are recommended to:

Conduct preliminary, evidence-based advocacy for RBM4ISD and support mapping of capacities/gaps and resources in the context of SDGs.
Invest in technical support to adapt the RBM4ISD framework to fit the country’s systems and processes.
Co-create and contextualize training materials with local institutions and partners.
Hand over to government departments, track progress and support evaluations to inform future directions.
2. Integrated communication campaigns are key advocacy platforms. 
In 2019, UNICEF developed and delivered integrated communication and advocacy campaigns using multiple channels to achieve positive changes for children. This included an innovative and integrated advocacy and communication tool, the ‘Ara Wade: A Vote for Children’ presidential pledge campaign. This was timed to engage two moments presenting unique advocacy opportunities– CRC@30 and the presidential election – to place children’s rights on the media and political agenda, with the specific goal of securing commitments from all 35 presidential candidates to prioritize six critical children’s issues. UNICEF would then work to convert commitments into action.
The campaign used two primary tools. First, direct advocacy was conducted with all presidential candidates and political parties, supported by direct advocacy with influential individuals from the private sector and civil society. Second, a multi-channel communication campaign used television, print, public relations, social media, digital advertising and direct (digital) mail to educate voters and the media on the six critical issues. Individuals were encouraged to undertake direct advocacy with candidates through a campaign website (www.arawade.lk) from which they could request action via emails to all 35 candidates.
This integrated campaign achieved its initial goals. All leading candidates, including the new president, committed to children’s priorities, with many including aspects of the campaign in their party manifesto. Children’s rights were firmly placed on the national agenda, with 39 items of national news coverage in four weeks. Members of the public were informed of the importance of child rights, and the campaign securing a digital reach of 28 million with over 5 million video views. Individuals were encouraged to act, with 1.19 million engagements, and a further 22,000 campaign email actions. Over 30 private sector entities were engaged, with 13 committing support for the campaign, and many publicly endorsing it. Through the campaign UNICEF also partnered with the Colombo Stock Exchange on World Children’s Day.
In 2020, UNICEF will build on these results to engage the new government, follow up with companies reached, and use the list of individuals who acted on the campaign.
The lessons learned through this campaign are:

Elections provide an opportunity to encourage discussion on children’s rights, however it is critical, albeit challenging, to maintain total impartiality.
Providing clear ways for individuals to ‘take action’ is important.
Adequate understanding of the issues must be ensured so advocacy messages resonate, and this takes time.
3. Underlying challenges to social cohesion can easily resurface. 
Over the last decade, the GoSL has focused on reconciliation amongst communities to address the ‘silent’ divisions that perpetuate and contribute to social disharmony, putting in place mechanisms to deliver on peacebuilding commitments. However, the Easter bombings in April 2019 eroded this delicate fabric of social cohesion.
Although UNICEF has been involved in peacebuilding and transitional justice programmes at national and sub-national levels, in collaboration with other UN agencies and development partners, this area of work has not been central to ongoing programming given Sri Lanka’s positive trajectory and graduation to upper-middle-income status. However, the lesson learned for the country office is that, in a context where grievances and underlying ethnic issues persist, it is prudent for UNICEF to ensure social cohesion is always mainstreamed into programming.
Following the attacks, UNICEF held a capacity development workshop, supported by HQ and Regional Office, for staff to apply a social cohesion lens to their work and to reflect on areas where conflict-sensitive programming should be strengthened. Moving forward, UNICEF will mainstream social cohesion programming by building aspects into programme design and introducing targeted interventions as appropriate.
 
"
WCAR,Benin,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Au cours de cette première année de mise en œuvre de son nouveau Programme de Coopération, UNICEF a appris plusieurs leçons, dont les quatre majeures sont reprises ci-dessous. 
 
La génération et/ou l’utilisation systématique des évidences probantes, couplées à un plaidoyer coordonné avec les autres partenaires, notamment la société civile constituent un atout essentiel pour convaincre et déclencher les actions en faveur des enfants. C’est ainsi par exemple que, 1) les conclusions des analyses sur les dépenses publiques sur l’éducation réalisées avec le soutien technique et financier de l’UNICEF, suivies d’un plaidoyer conjoint par UNICEF-SWB- a permis l’augmentation de la ligne du budget national destinée aux manuels scolaires de 100 millions à 1 milliard de francs CFA entre 2019 et 2020 ; 2) en ligne avec la note budgétaire sur les affaires sociales développée avec l’appui financier et technique de l’UNICEF et le plaidoyer de UNICEF ensemble avec la société civile (SWB, etc.), le gouvernement a alloué dans les délais, de ressources financières à 85 CPS selon l’allocation majorée depuis 2018 de plus de 340.000.000 francs CFA.  
 
La coordination effective des efforts entre PTFs dans le soutien à la mise en œuvre est indispensable pour offrir des services de qualité à un plus grand nombre d’enfants. Ceci a été le cas, 1) dans le cadre de la prise en charge des enfants victimes d’abus sexuel où le renforcement de synergie d’actions entre les sections du bureau de l’UNICEF et les autres partenaires (Médecins du Monde, Caritas, DEDRAS, USAID, Plan International, TDH, Care International, etc.) a permis un meilleur accès aux services de qualité aux enfants ; et 2) dans la distribution des fournitures scolaires pour l’année scolaire 2019 – 2020. Plutôt que d’aller en ordre dispersé, UNICEF ensemble avec les autres PTFs (Plan International, Educo et la Fondation MTN du secteur Privé.) de l’Education ont soutenu le Gouvernement pour harmoniser le contenu des kits scolaires et ont mis ensemble leurs contributions permettant ainsi d’éviter les doublons et d’avoir une couverture plus grande.   
 
Les innovations pertinentes, bien conduites et rapidement mises en valeur (showcase), offrent une opportunité pour l’accélération des résultats pour les enfants. A titre d’illustration, 1) une approche initiée par UNICEF comportant la correction du dénominateur dans le calcul de la couverture vaccinale a permis d’améliorer la couverture en Penta 3 dans les 14 zones sanitaires soutenues par UNICEF. Le partage de cette expérience a déjà permis son adoption par le ministère de la santé et son extension à 18 autres zones sanitaires. Son extension sera poursuivie en 2020 ; 2) un modèle de soins optimisé en faveur du couple mère-nouveau-né, incluant le recours aux bracelets électroniques pour le dépistage précoce des baisses de températures chez les nouveau-nés avec un faible poids de naissance initié par UNICEF, a été présenté aux partenaires techniques tels que la Banque mondiale, l’USAID et la Coopération Technique Belge (Enabel) lors d’une mission de terrain dans le cadre de la visite conjointe entre le ministère de la santé et les PTFs.  A la suite de la visite, ces partenaires techniques et financiers ont exprimé leur intérêt de soutenir la mise à l’échelle de cette approche dans leurs zones de couverture. 
 
Enfin, le changement des politiques nationales a occasionné des délais dans la mise en œuvre des activités importantes prévues en 2019. Par exemple, 1) la révision de la politique nationale sur la santé communautaire a été une contrainte significative à la mise en œuvre des activités à base communautaire et a ralenti l’extension des activités déjà en cours du fait qu’il faille attendre d’avoir les nouvelles directives opérationnelles ; et 2) la finalisation et la mise en œuvre  du Plan de Formation Continue des enseignants a été ralenti par la non disponibilité de la Politique Nationale de l’Enseignant qui doit fournir les orientations stratégiques à la formation des enseignants. Ceci indique la nécessité de notre capacité d’anticipation et de clairvoyance pour prendre en compte ces changements de nos planifications.  
 
En plus des innovations déjà mentionnées ci-dessus, UNICEF Benin a soutenu trois autres innovations importantes suivantes. La mise en réseau des acteurs en charge de la vaccination par WhatsApp (EQUIVAC) pour un suivi hebdomadaire des couvertures vaccinales en Penta 3. Grâce ce réseau, les acteurs de terrain envoient leurs données de couvertures qui sont analysées régulièrement avec un feedback automatique et la comparaison des performances.  
 
Le développement d’une application mobile dénommée ‘'VAXYRAPPEL’’ qui permet grâce à la digitalisation des informations relatives aux naissances d’envoyer directement aux mères d’enfants de moins de 5 ans des messages vocaux pour le rappel des rendez de vaccination. Le même système intègre le rappel des rendez-vous pour la réalisation du PCR chez les enfants nés de mères séropositives. L’application a été développé dans le cadre du projet “innov4children” qui a soutenu trois projets d’application mobiles créés par 12 jeunes Béninois pour offrir une réponse créative aux problèmes des enfants. Cette innovation a démontré qu’en donnant l’opportunité aux jeunes, ils sont capables de mettre à profit leur inventivité au service des droits de l’enfant.  
 
Le nouveau système d’information (SIDoFFE–NG) assortie d’une application Web est une innovation qui va permettre aux Centres de Promotion Sociale d’accéder directement au système pour l’entrée et la gestion des données collectées sans être dépendants du niveau central. 
 
Les leçons apprises de la première année de mise en œuvre du programme pays réconfortent la pertinence des stratégies retenues par UNICEF dans les théories de changement et les cadres de résultats de différentes composantes du programme pays. Dans le cadre de son Plan de Gestion Annuel (AMP) 2020, le bureau pays prendra avantages des opportunités émergentes observées en 2019 pour intensifier ses efforts visant l’accélération des résultats pour les enfants, surtout les plus défavorisés, avec une attention particulière sur les aspects ci-dessous.
 
Construisant sur l’engouement créée parmi les partenaires et le ministère autour des innovations initiées dans le domaine de la santé, UNICEF déploiera les efforts nécessaires pour matérialiser la mise à l’échelle de ces innovations en 2020, en particulier celle sur l’approche équité sur la vaccination afin d’accélérer le KRC1.    
 
UNICEF capitalisera sur son rôle de Chef de file du secteur Education pour mobiliser davantage un partenariat agissant pour soutenir et accélérer les efforts initiés par le Gouvernement dans le domaine de l’éducation, en particulier l’amélioration de la qualité (KRC4).
 
Enfin, UNICEF prendra avantage de la mobilisation croissante parmi les acteurs aux niveaux national, départemental, local et communautaire pour intensifier les efforts de lutte contre les violences faites aux enfants en particulier les violences sexuelles (KRC5) et le mariage des enfants (KRC6), avec espoir de célébrer le premier village ‘’Zéro Mariage d’enfants’’ d’ici la fin de 2020.
"
WCAR,Burkina Faso,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"1. Humanitarian-development nexus programming 
Community-led Total Sanitation (CLTS)
A technical note on the operational strategies for WASH in emergency was developed through UNICEF’s support to the Government which defines the CLTS strategies in emergency-affected zones. Mobilization of trained village leaders in remote and insecure areas was identified as an alternative strategy to facilitate CLTS in zones of limited accessibility. Targeted subsidy approach, as opposed to its systematic use, was also recommended given the large-scale population flux in host communities with limited access to sanitation.
The Safe School Initiative
UNICEF-Burkina Faso commissioned a comparative analysis of nine schools in Sahel and Nord regions to capture initial results from the Safe school strategy. In the intervention schools, the perception of safety among children and teachers was higher, and further increased by community participation. In a rapid evaluation conducted in 63 “safe” schools, 78 per cent (98/126) of the teachers acknowledged that the Safe school strategy has enabled schools to continue operating. The development of local capacity in psychological care proved of great benefit to communities and some of the teachers who were able to return to the schools.
Accountability of the emergency-affected population 
To strengthen accountability towards affected population, 25 municipalities in the Sahel region are testing a digital feedback mechanism on the quality of birth registration services using RapidPro. This system captures feedback on quality services, reported by 536 trained community leaders (including 141 women) on a quarterly basis. The information will be used by local authorities to identify service delivery-related bottlenecks and improve birth registration services. UNICEF is exploring the application of this real-time, participatory reporting system in other zones of limited access, to monitor the humanitarian situation and quality of emergency responses.
2. Fostering innovations 
A partnership with scouts for U-report
Through a new partnership with the national scouts’ movement, over 545 youth scouts developed their knowledge on MHM, health, education and child rights. With the trained scouts, the CO organized five live chats through the U-Report platform, which facilitated an interactive exchange with 13,127 U-reporters (44 per cent girls) on these topics including sensitive topics such as MHM. 
EduTrac 
UNICEF continued to pilot EduTrac, a RapidPro-based data collection system in 1,275 schools in the Sahel and Centre-Nord regions through conducting 14 surveys. The system was developed in 2018 and migrated to the Ministry of Education’s server in November 2019. Geographical mapping of closed schools using EduTrac has been a helpful entry point for MoE to collect further data and better understand the situation to plan appropriate responses.
Nudging techniques for handwashing promotion 
An action research on handwashing and behavior change through “nudging” techniques was piloted in 10 primary schools in Gourma, Est region. Attractive hand washing stations for children were set up, assuming that they would lure children to wash their hands even in absence of hygiene promotion. Initial observation after installation of these devices showed that 39.5 per cent of students washed their hands after using the toilet, compared to the baseline of 29 per cent.
3. UN working together 
Children associated with armed groups and forces 
In the growing insecurity, children and adolescents are increasingly exposed to the risk of being associated with armed groups and forces. In October 2019, the Resident coordinator, UNICEF and UNOHCHR had a conference call with the Special representative of the secretary-general for children and armed conflict. Following the call, the Special representative wrote to the President, requesting his support to accelerate the development and signature of a handover protocol of children associated with armed groups and forces (CAAGF). Through UNODC and UNICEF’s joint advocacy, the Ministry of Justice organized a workshop to reflect on prevention and protection of CAAGF, resulting in draft national action plan on CAAGF and a handover protocol which are under finalization.
Programme criticality exercise
The UN system in Burkina Faso conduct a Program criticality (PC) exercise, led by UNICEF. The excise consisted of capacity development of 40 PC focal points from UN agencies, followed by a peer review workshop and validation of the PC results by the UNCT.The UNCT’s buy-in to the exercise was key to the success. Involvement of the senior programme staff and security officers from UN agencies helped establish an important link between the Security risk management and the PC assessment.
UNICEF-UNFPA joint programme 
During the Design Workshop for the Phase II of the UNFPA-UNICEF Global Programme to accelerate action to End Child Marriage, UNICEF-Burkina Faso shared the experience of “Using Qualitative Research to inform Programming”. In-depth insights through qualitative research with women, especially aunts, played a powerful role in child marriage in the Burkinabe context. Qualitative research also provided insights on community-based actions to address child marriage.
The CO also shared a good practice on “Guideline for public declaration” during the Annual meeting of the UNFPA-UNICEF Joint Programme on elimination of FGM. This guide elaborated in 2017 through UNICEF and UNFPA’s joint advocacy and capacity development, is a catalytic reference document to ensure harmonization of public declaration process for the FGM abandonment.
4. Leveraging partnership for children 
Since 2017, UNICEF-Burkina Faso has nurtured a partnership with the gold mining industry through the Corporate Social responsibility (CSR) forum. The revised Mining Code (2017) introduced the new Mining Funds for Local Development (MFLD) to mobilize additional resources for the Local Development Plans (LDP). UNICEF implemented a pilot project of this innovative partnership in two municipalities. The project aims at: 1) developing municipal LDPs that are relevant to local child right priorities; and 2) modeling multi-sectoral interventions for vulnerable children through leveraging funds from the mining industry.
In December 2019, the Chamber of Mines and UNICEF organized a briefing on the pilot and the humanitarian situation, attended by 24 participants including 12 mining companies. UNICEF encouraged the companies to: 1) contribute to monitoring violation of child rights in humanitarian settings; 2) strengthen an inclusive consultation process involving emergency-affected and host populations alike; and 3) enhance collaboration with local authorities, civil society and UNICEF to make a better synergy in addressing the communities’ priorities.

WCAR,Cabo Verde,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In the field of education
Regular consultations with national partners have resulted in greater agreement and commitment to achieve goals and implement planned activities. Approximately 90% of the work plan activities were successfully completed.
- Ongoing dialogue with national partners has helped to overcome many constraints related to administrative processes.
- UNICEF, through its cooperation and technical assistance work has continued to act as a partner and coordinating agency for the Global Partnership for Education, enabling the country to replicate funding (US$1,100,000) for the programme Strengthening Quality Education, Inclusion and Reduction of Disparities.
- The programme approach has allowed for synergies between the thematic portfolios
In the field of health
The close technical cooperation relationship between national partners and UNICEF Cabo Verde has made it possible to integrate the strategic areas that contribute to child and adolescent health, having these areas integrated into strategic, central and decentralized planning, allowing for permanent monitoring of interventions in the country's 22 municipalities.
Coordination efforts between UNICEF and other United Nations agencies, particularly UNFPA and WHO, have contributed to robust technical collaboration in the country with regard to monitoring through the strengthened Health Information System (HIS), evaluation and programme planning aimed at strengthening the quality of the national response in the area of child health. Likewise, intersectoral coordination between health, education, food security and UNICEF in the areas of mother and child health, immunization and nutrition has contributed to the achievement of important results in terms of availability and access to integrated services, the institutional delivery rate of 93 per cent and infant mortality of 16‰ (2018).
Partnership and resource mobilization efforts have increased the stakeholder group with the participation of the private sector and civil society organizations (Cabo Verde Red Cross and the NGO VERDEFAM) in child and maternal nutrition interventions.
The promotion of South-South and Triangular Cooperation has enabled technical exchanges between the Cabo Verde and CPLP countries and Brazil by allowing the identification of knowledge-sharing mechanisms aimed at strengthening the quality of services, particularly in the area of mother and child health.
In the field of child protection
Approximately 100% of the Annual Work Plan Activities were successfully completed and 96-98% delivery achieved. The frequent contacts with the national partners successfully contributed for the achievement of the results of the programme.
The 2 Mission to Cabo Verde allowed the CP Specialist to strengthen the contact and technical assistance with the WCARO and Head Quarter CP team;
The joint office has allowed us to better integrate actions in favor of children (health, education, and environment portfolio).
In the field of child poverty
Regarding this thematic, it should be highlighted the II National Meeting of Coordinators of the Single Social Registry (SSR) as a space for reflection and evaluation of the process of institutionalization of the Social Registry in municipal services and the improvement of operational conditions to ensure that the target is met: to register the total poor population in Cape Verde by March 2020. It brought together around 21 participants (municipal SSR coordinators, social area councilors).
Also, the INFF-MAPS mission was an important gain to the country, aiming to define acceleration mechanisms for the implementation of the SDG's.
"
WCAR,Central African Republic,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"3.1 Programme implementation
 
UNICEF further developed the use of the RRM as an entry point to facilitate and enable complementary UNICEF responses for increased speed and multisectoral impact. This was done with the intention of both: 1) having a more comprehensive first response; 2) ensuring a more sustainable response to meeting needs when the initial RRM response is over. Following the attacks on villages in Paoua area (Northwest) in May which resulted in 49 deaths and the displacement of 12,000 people, UNICEF staff from the emergency and child protection sections deployed within days alongside RRM partners. Together, they ensured emergency assistance in the NFI, child protection, health and education sectors for over 11,400 children and their family members.  In Birao in September, RRM partners deployed within three days for a life-saving WASH and NFI intervention. UNICEF staff joined them soon after to start complementary child protection and education interventions, while designing and contracting a follow up WASH project. In order to strengthen its capacity to quickly respond in a quality manner UNICEF:
 

established a ‘Child Protection Rapid Response team’ comprised of UNICEF, NGO partners and Ministry of the Promotion of Women and Family and Protection of Children staff.  The team has been able to quickly deploy to respond to emergencies when there is a lack of capacity on the ground.  A first successful response was provided to the Birao’s emergency.
supported quick response health/nutrition mobile clinics to provide immediate health and nutrition support during crisis.  This was deployed successfully after flooding in hard to reach parts of the Southeast.
 
As both models have proven to be effective, UNICEF at present is taking stock of success and challenges and looking into continuing and bolstering these and other similar approaches in 2020.
 
Regular meetings between stakeholders, under the leadership of the Minister of Health and Population, have made it possible to remove bottlenecks and to improve results in immunization and HIV. Community-based screening of HIV with the involvement of people living with HIV (PLHIV) has led to improved testing rates for children and adolescents. The establishment of community care sites and capacity building of Community Health Workers (CHW) contributed to early detection of the main killer diseases of children and treating simple cases and improved referral of complicated cases to the Health Centers. Integration of IYCF promotion with treatment of acute malnutrition cases has proved an efficient strategy to scale up preventive actions and break the vicious cycle of malnutrition.
 
UNICEF provides direct support for service delivery for vulnerable children in CAR now but there is a recognition that upstream work at national level is required to strengthen government capacity to deliver services in a more sustainable manner. UNICEF's child protection programme adopted this approach in CAR, but progress has been mixed. A major step forward was achieved in 2019 with the conceptualisation and piloting of a national case management framework for child protection.  However, efforts will need to be sustained over several years before systemic change can be achieved. 
 
More flexibility is also needed in the design of reintegration of children released from armed groups in CAR.Many armed groups and militias have strong community roots so in some situations, children associated with them remain with their families. Some children associated with these groups and militias may be attending schools during the day and undertake military chores in the evening. In such a context, it is becoming more apparent that reintegration programmes must move away from traditional strategies focused on support to individual children to much broader reintegration programmes that would target all vulnerable children in the affected communities. These approaches would engage families and communities and identify sustainable interventions to address drivers of recruitment and use.
 
3.2 Operational Support
 
Given the limited capacity of the domestic local market both in terms of volume and quality, an assessment of the regional market was carried out in 2018, leading to a strong focus on developing regional LTAs. In 2019, the office increased its regional procurement portfolio mainly from the Cameroon market. LTAs have been raised in collaboration with Cameroon CO to procure WASH and Education supplies. Positive feedback was received on the quality of goods (bucket, jerrycans, printing materials) and savings of about 50 per cent, and reduced delivery time of about 60 days.
 
The collaboration with the logistics partner AIRD did not unfortunately materialize in 2019, due mainly to management issues on their side. Discussions with the new team have been launched and the partnership will be fully implemented in early 2020, leading to (i) substantial savings in costs for fuel and programme supplies; and (ii) better maintenance and repair services for our fleet, closer to the zonal offices. Another emerging opportunity is the inter-agency warehousing project under UNICEF’s lead, which, if given adequate land by the government, could lead to savings of up to USD 720,000 over 5 years. In 2019, 11 digital senders and copy machines were replaced with five (5) Canon multi-function equipment, leading to higher performance and a significant reduction in costs due to lower volume of toners, paper and maintenance needed. The use of a solar energy system in the Bossangoa office led to a saving in fuel consumption of about USD 17,000 for the year. A similar project should be implemented for the Bambari office in 2020.
 
3.3 Management oversight 
 
In 2019, management focused on obtaining results towards: 1) improving working conditions and encouraging work-life balance and living conditions, particularly in the zonal offices (through targeted investments responding to staff’s expressed needs); 2) operationalizing the field offices’ accountability framework, thereby delegating responsibilities at the field level and empowering the relevant staff; 3) holding regular discussions and joint reflections on ethics; 4) developing and strengthening existing SOPs to ensure maximum efficiency and effectiveness; 5) aligning with audit’s recommendations and improving HACT compliance; 6) strengthening inter-sectoral cooperation and overall cooperation within the team. This led to a more cohesive, better motivated team.
"
WCAR,Chad,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The lessons learned in 2019 and presented here are framed in the context of the Key Results for Children (KRC)but have broader programmatic applicability. They include the benefits of strong government ownership and leadership from the top, using positive and negative experiences to guide the scaling-up of strategies and approaches and leveraging technology in the pursuit of equitable results. In 2020, MICS6 data collected in 2019 will be available to measure impact.
The Ministry of Economy and Development Planning launched the national Roadmap KRC in Chad in early 2019.
KRC1. The key constraints hindering immunization performance in Chad, especially routine immunization, are: vaccine stock outs at peripheral level (directly linked to insufficient government funding for routine vaccines); the very limited reach of the cold chain (only 49 per cent of health facilities have an approved functional cold chain); and limited implementation of the accountability framework developed following the 2018 Forum on immunization, chaired by the President. All three of these constraints were tackled with some success during 2019. 
UNICEF Chad leveraged its partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and GAVI Alliance to support advocacy efforts with the government to secure vaccine stocks. Regular meetings with the Head of State proved crucial in securing commitments to financing immunization. Political commitment at the highest level, as well as the personal engagement of the Minister of health in ensuring follow up of results with provincial delegations and district heads were instrumental in driving measles campaign results during 2019. However, accountability for routine immunization results as per the 2018 roadmap and Immunization Forum report remains an issue. Strengthened supervision and communication for development implemented during the 2019 vaccination campaigns contributed to achieving better and faster results compared to previous years. This was particularly the case with the measles campaigns, which saw a drastic decrease in the number of cases in the target districts compared to the rest of the country. The newly consolidated C4D unit will further strengthen this approach in 2020. In addition, new partnerships with KfW around the integrated community-based approach to healthcare in the Sahel belt, where community health workers deliver promotional and preventive services, including closer monitoring of vaccination at community level, are expected to yield tangible results for KRC1 in 2020. On-going implementation of the GAVI-supported Cold Chain Optimization Platform Initiative, in addition to other efforts by UNICEF, should secure further progress in cold chain coverage in 2020.   
A more targeted and participatory approach to sustainable access to education (KRC3) yielded results, despite the enormous challenges presented by the crisis-driven cumulative numbers of out-of-school children at primary level and the low per capita financing in the sector. The importance of a balanced mix of private sector construction and involvement of communities and decentralized levels of the ministry of education in choosing construction sites, monitoring construction and contributing to maintenance was identified during a programmatic evaluation in 2019. With strengthened coordination among partners in the targeted provinces, the out-of-school rate could start declining by the end of 2021. The risk that World Bank funding for the salaries of more than 3,000 contract teachers and around 13,000 community teachers (representing 36 per cent of the total primary cycle teacher workforce) could cease before the 2020-21 school year will necessitate intensive advocacy to ensure that the government fills this gap.
New guidelines on WASH in schools developed jointly by both ministries will ensure that special attention is paid to upgrading sanitation facilities in the 60 per cent of schools constructed by the community using local materials (millet stalks) to ensure that strengthened girls' enrolment continues to expand, specifically in rural schools.
The on-going policy and institutional reforms regarding birth registration (KRC7) have taken a considerable amount of time, with a negative impact on the numbers of births registered during the transition period UNICEF is engaging with the national agency for civil registration and vital statistics (ANATS), with a view to supporting the expansion of the agency’s remit outside of N’Djamena. Before ANATS and the digitalization of birth declaration are fully functional, Chad will pass through an interim period, possibly spanning several years, where the ‘old’ system needs to be supported to avoid an interruption in service and an increasing backlog in birth registration. The situation is complex as the ‘old system’ will no longer operate within a recognized governmental framework. However, numerous children can be reached if we focus on strengthening interoperability in the UNICEF prioritized provinces, relying on guidelines and agreements with the ministries involved, while ensuring availability of birth registration registers in the remaining provinces in support of the ‘old’ system.     
The importance of linking humanitarian response and long-term development was highlighted in 2019, most conspicuously in the water and sanitation and education sectors (KRC8 and KRC3), which targeted populations beyond those directly affected in order to increase access to essential services for host communities, and catalyse social cohesion and peacebuilding. New financing facilities and larger-scale programmes were launched in 2019, especially in the Lake Chad region, including the UNDP-funded Stabilization Facility for Lake Chad, the European Union DIZA programme focusing on inclusive development in the host communities and the World Bank supported PARCA programme with its focus on refugees and host communities. All of these programmes have potential to change the trajectory of the country within the next few years, as they aim to secure stability, bridge service provision gaps within an inclusive and sustainable development approach and build social cohesion and peace. Maintaining strategic partnerships with these donors and partners in 2020, and ensuring coordination of targeting and complementarity of interventions for greater impact will be critical.
The remaining two years of the Country Programme will see a reinforcement of the KRC focus, expansion of the integrated community-based approach, enhanced intersectoral synergy, and geographic convergence, with a strengthened role for Zone Offices in programme planning and delivery for results.

WCAR,Congo,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The following are key reflections on the lessons learned and innovations which emanated in 2019. One of the major constraints for the effective planning, monitoring and evaluation of development programmes and national policies is lack of an accurate picture of children’s vulnerability status and access to their rights owing to the shortage of recent and reliable data. This is in part due to the weakness of the legal framework governing statistics in Congo. The lesson learned is that the UN system and other development partners must increase their efforts to support the country in the strengthening of national statistical systems and to promote a culture of data driven decision making. For UNICEF, this means continuing to provide high-quality disaggregated data for children through the support to national surveys such as MICS, and to strengthen and improve the Monitoring and Evaluation Framework, by promoting stronger evaluation culture and by producing robust evaluations on child-related programmes which are needed to support SDGs monitoring and reporting.
Regarding innovation, child participation was at the heart of interventions during 2019. There was the establishment of mechanisms that elevated and amplified adolescents’ voices, ideas and creativity. As part of the celebration of the CRC@30, the CO organised a photography workshop that allowed a group of 20 Congolese children and adolescents, girls and boys, from six different regions and different backgrounds, to express their voices through photography. These children are now youth bloggers who take pictures and write stories on children’s rights and during UNICEF’s advocacy events. A contest to identify youth bloggers has also been set-up which calls for adolescents and young children to send pictures and information on a different issue every month. Together with UNDP, the CO embarked on a series of strategic discussions on Generation Unlimited bringing Young people together. As a result, the ‘Youth Challenge’ initiative was launched in December 2019.
Furthermore, CO continued to invest in staff career development; 74 per cent of staff members completed their individual training and all staff completed mandatory training. Group training was held on career development (through professional Coaching and Workshops) to support managers and staff in engaging in a smooth Change Management and transition into the new country programme 2020-2024.
As part of the ‘Duty of Care’ principles to boost the staff morale and improve working conditions, the funding and technical support from the Regional Office and the DFAM[1] (through AMS[2]) was highly appreciated and considered as the significant factor of the success of the renovation of UNICEF Congo CO for inclusiveness and accessibility of its premises.
The office reduced the carbon footprint, which was confirmed by the Energy and Water audit consumption done through a Regional Consultant in December 2019. The increase of the bandwidth through local Internet Service Providers has boosted the advocacy for the use of SharePoint and the cloud for data management, including archiving. In 2019, the use of those systems increased among the staff.
Going forward, the country office will capitalise on emerging opportunities that can help to reach the furthest behind children and accelerate results at scale in collaboration with the private sector.  The CO will work to harness the power, reach and influence business actors on behalf of children with a view to support UNICEF’s programmatic activities and reach the most disadvantaged communities by providing them with access to services and key information.
In addition, UNICEF will continue to advocate for ‘value for money and improved budgeting for children’ including supporting the Health Ministry to make good use of the VII platform to procure vaccines and health commodities, thus improving efficiency gains and reducing costs.
UNICEF Congo will strategically sustain the gains achieved in 2019 in the area of ‘Duty of Care’ and management excellence, PF4C, data for children, violence against children, resource leveraging and mobilization, into our 2020 AMPs. As the 2020 will be the first year of the new country programme cycle 2020-2024, the CO will explore new avenues such as those under PF4C, including poverty analysis and measurement, as a tool for reducing inequality and poverty in Congo. A greater focus on innovations through partnership building, will be central to strategic UNICEF supported interventions in 2020.

WCAR,Cote D'Ivoire,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"1. Plastic bricks project  
In 2019, the Country Office continued to strengthen its partnership with “Conceptos Plasticos”, the Colombian social enterprise, to build classrooms using bricks produced from recycled plastic. This project aims to improve equitable and sustainable access to quality education for children, and empower women and youth, while also promoting new attitudes and beliefs towards recycling and the protection of the environment. In 2019, pilot classrooms (26 classrooms so far) were built with recycled plastic bricks imported from Colombia.  The Country Office wishes to produce recycled plastic bricks in Côte d’Ivoire. The lead of the Operations team, including the Innovation Specialist who is under the supervision of the Deputy Representative of Operations and the strong support from the Representative, played a key role in ensuring success.
 
The plastic bricks factory plant in Abidjan is 80 per cent complete and will be able to undertake test runs   in February 2020 with plans to become fully functional in March. UNICEF had to create a special contract with “Conceptos Plasticos” that enables a shared value partnership and gives more flexibility to both parties as compared to a contract for goods. However, the nature of the partnership is evolving, and the Country Office will soon develop a Partner Cooperation Agreement (PCA) with the newly created NGO “Conceptos Plasticos Côte d’Ivoire” to benefit from their expertise in social development, notably in the organization of a network of female collectors of plastics for recycling in the factory.
 
So far, the project has created an extraordinary enthusiasm with new partnerships and raising up additional USD 1,738,709 with new perspective to come. The nature of these “new donors” is, however, very different from “traditional donors” since they are more demanding in terms of budget and communication materials. The budget part was tricky because in the process of developing this project, additional costs had to be taken into account in the construction costs. The initial cost of US$ 10,000 per classroom only calculated the plastic infrastructure, and was not aligned with MoE norms and standards, which stipulate the inclusion of WASH facilities and at least one teacher’s office. The cost was revised dividing the construction of a standard school according to the number of classrooms. But this cost still did not reflect the real cost of a functioning classroom, which should include school equipment (e.g. desks, school kits) and “soft” costs for the social mobilisation around the school, teacher’s training, UNICEF technical expertise and other support costs.  Since production has not yet begun in Côte d’Ivoire, the real price of recycled plastic bricks required adjustments.  
Another challenge for the Country Office was to integrate this project approach into programmes and to articulate this big project within the CPD. The development of an impact bond proposal with the French NatCom and BNP Parisbas helped to gather all programmes around this innovation, as construction projects are needed in all programme areas. In addition, the development of the new 2021-2025 CPD offers a wonderful opportunity to integrate the plastic brick project into programmatic objectives.
 
2. Mobile money and real-time monitoring system
The Country Office continued using mobile money for payments to beneficiaries and partners; in 2019, 70 per cent of programmes used this technology for the implementation of their activities, saving time, enhancing traceability, and transparency of transactions. For instance, the digital payments allowed the payment of about US$ 5 million to over 30,000 health workers and Community Health Workers participating in vaccination campaigns. Despite some payment delays, this payment approach is highly appreciated by the final beneficiaries. With the creation of a temporary post at the end of 2019, the Country Office aims to improve the process and identify additional partners for optimization purposes.
 
As the Country Office continues to innovate for children, it is paramount to consider the context in which the new solution is being implemented to ensure that it is feasible and appropriate – this gives the project a higher chance of success and sustainability. One example of this is the Country Office’s choice to use SMS for real-time monitoring, as opposed to digital channels like Facebook because the majority of people use simple feature phones. In 2019, the Country Office piloted the use of Edu-Trac through RapidPro to support the timely collection and transmission of key education indicators, and provide analysis and feedback in five regions in the north-west of the country. When this system is scaled up in over 500 schools, it will help to build a decision support system that will capture several key indicators for improving the quality of the education system.
In 2019, the Country Office was able to scale up and monitor (using RapidPro) pilot life-saving innovations introduced in 2018. As a result: 99 per cent of mothers with severe postpartum hemorrhage survived thanks to the intra-uterine balloon tamponade (UBT); 96 per cent of newborns with severe asphyxia survived thanks to resuscitator mask; and 98 per cent of premature babies admitted in Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) units survived. Real-time monitoring also supported vaccination campaigns to raise awareness, collect data and provide a grievance redress system with over 300,000 people using the tool.
 
3. Public Private Partnerships (PPP)
In 2019, the Country Office continued to leverage existing and new partnerships with the private sector, notably in the areas of nutrition, WASH, social policy, youth and adolescents. However, this requires human resources with specific skills set (e.g. familiarity with the business world) as partnerships’ work is highly relational. To fill this gap the Country Office activated innovative collaborations with an international business school and the Spanish Economic Office in Abidjan.
In 2019, the Country Office provided support for the finalization and launch of the new national action plan to fight child labour, and the development of a new transformative PPP with the cocoa growing sector. The development of the new PPP with the cocoa sector was very time consuming but allowed other programmes, such as health, nutrition, education, WASH and child protection, to participate in discussions with the private sector on how best to address child labour in cocoa growing regions.
"
WCAR,Democratic Republic of Congo,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"DRC’s nexus approach: The nexus implementation approach of the 2020-2024 Country Programme promotes synergy across programmes and addresses overlapping deprivations faced by children at sub-national level.
To ensure a successful evidence-based roll-out, the country office tested the mentioned approach in three pilot zones of convergence, Nsele in Kinshasa province, Kipushi in Katanga province, and Kabalo in Tanganiyika province. Lessons learned from these pilot zones, combined with an in-depth analysis of the stakeholders’ perspectives, led to the development of the theory of change of the UNICEF DRC country programme. Through the pilot, the National Institute of Statistics and UNICEF have also been able to strengthen the capacity of local partners at institutional level. A set of ready-to-use assets and standardized, innovative tools (for example, Android devices used for data collection, surveys, and analysis) were also produced and will be used for undertaking additional baseline surveys and data collection, facilitating the gradual extension of the approach to the 29 targeted health zones and the systematic monitoring of the situation of women and children in DRC.
Mobile payment in the Ebola response: To financially support Ebola-affected families in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, UNICEF partnered with one of the main mobile operators in DRC, Vodacom. This collaboration enabled the utilization of an e-mobile cash platform, Vodacash, allowing UNICEF’s teams to directly implement some interventions. This approach has been instrumental to allowing the mobile teams to provide a rapid response when a new area is affected. 
Following this experience, mobile cash will be further extended to other areas of UNICEF’s work in support of the most disadvantaged children and families; for example, in humanitarian settings and response, or in regular cash transfer programmes.  The biggest advantage of using mobile cash is the direct reach to targeted families, that also serves as a mitigation measure against fraud or the potential misuse of funds.
Donor engagement: The country office advanced the implementation of its 2019 Resource Mobilization Strategy focusing on its top three public sector donors (USA, UK, Sweden), engagement with potential donors (Norway and Germany), and deepening partnerships with International Financial Institutions (World Bank). In total, these efforts resulted in the mobilization of a total budget of US$ 249,674,980. Donors received timely and substantial communication around their investments for children. Out of the 105 donor reports, 99 per cent were submitted on time.
The country office also continued its efforts to harness the power of the private sector for vulnerable mining communities through advocating via multi-stakeholder platforms such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, appealing to potential donors (nine major car companies and electronics producers), and engaging with four mining companies to understand their social investment strategies in the country.
UNICEF DRC remains very grateful to its donors for their continued interest and their valuable support that have contributed to the fulfilment of children’s rights in the DRC.
"
WCAR,Equatorial Guinea,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The national reorientation exercise for the drafting of the New Development Plan was a good opportunity for UNICEF to establish itself as a trusted partner of Government institutions. It was also an entry point to promote more inclusive approaches with development partners with an increased focus on the leaving no one behind SDG principle. Additionally, during the National Conference and Plan development processes, held only every decade, the Government recognized the urgency to generate data and evidence for improved results-based planning.
The approach to consolidate the UNDAF results group and align it with the four main axes of the revised National Development Plan 2035 (poverty eradication/human capital, social inclusion/governance, economic diversification and environment sustainability) was an important decision to strengthen the coordination among UN agencies and Government.
The advocacy made throughout the year based on the PF4C study focusing on the need to increase social spending, resulted in an increase of 27% in the planned national budget for the social sector in 2020. However, Government approvals of Laws, Policies and Plans remain limited, despite UNICEF’s high-level advocacy efforts as exemplified by 30th Anniversary of the CRC celebrations. To this end, the CO will review its technical capacity and strategy to improve and engage more effectively on upstream work.
The integration of the Child-Friendly District initiative contributed to the strengthening of the CO’s programme coordination and the local Government’s capacity in convening actors and key stakeholders on child-rights issues. The country has made substantial efforts in improving infrastructure and human resources in line with its district urbanization strategy. However, the implementation of an integrated social service initiative at the district level still faces challenges due to the lack of local decision-making capacity which is mainly related to the limited application of the local development legislation.   
The CO launched its first official website and social media channels (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube) in accordance with the Global Communication and Advocacy Strategy. The visibility of the CO improved substantially as demonstrated the by progressive increase of followers during the year in Twitter (600), Facebook (560), Instagram (1400), which included the publications of 18 videos in YouTube. 
The last vaccination campaign applying an integrated strategy with polio vaccination, vitamin A supplementation and deworming, yielded unsatisfactory results. This highlighted the structural weaknesses of the social mobilization/communication, supervision and field level coordination and logistics capacity in line with the identified routine vaccination services bottlenecks. To partially address some of these structural bottlenecks, UNICEF introduced the use of new technologies to manage stock of vaccines and vaccine arrival reports (ViVa platform/VAR Mobile app). 
In HIV/AIDS, the need to implement visits post-training of health workers is the most effective way to ensure that best practices on adhering to national guidelines and protocol on HIV prevention, care and treatment. The plan to implement the HMIS shows the need to strengthen the administrative data and capacity at national level to manage the data analysis as well as reducing the verticalization of sectoral health programme.
As an innovation, the CO finalized and published an evaluation on HIV/AIDS Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT)/Option B+. It was the CO’s first completed evaluation which served as an important tool to inform programming. A poster of the PMTCT evaluation was also presented as a best practice in the Global Evaluation meeting held at HQ.
In Education the shift from service delivery to upstream work will continue, in line with the Country Programme over-arching strategy. During the remaining period of the Country Programme, the Education Section will prioritize generation of data and evidence and policy and advocacy work through conducting studies, related to education quality, violence in school, classroom practices and teaching methodology.
The experience acquired by UNICEF in the full implementation of the HACT as per HQ’s guidance has been fundamental in improving the coordination among UN-agencies and strengthening the capacity building in governance and financial management of partners.
The implementation of the newly approved local salary scale will require a coherent adjustment of the staffing structure to be in line with the initial approved budget for the country programme 2019-2023. Stronger inter-agency collaborations are needed to ensure regular implementation of salary surveys to avoid serious budget management constraints, particularly related to RR and OR as they are approved on a five-year basis.
The CO recognises the need to diversify and innovate its resource mobilisation portfolio, which relies mainly on funding from UNICEF Thematic resources, Government through the UNDAF, the EU, and UNICEF Italian National Committee. As a result, CO initiated a process of engagement with the public and private sectors and CSOs aimed at tapping into CSRs of the oil and gas industry, which will be better tailored and accelerated in 2020. Furthermore, and to diversify the capacity development strategy CO signed MoUs with National Red Cross to strengthen the emergency preparedness and with SOS/Children’s Villages to promote child-rights as per international standards stipulated in the CRC. UNICEF also signed MoUs with two universities (UNGE and UAM) to provide internship opportunities for national students. To strengthen national coverage of routine immunization and leverage funds to the Government, UNICEF partnered with local Rotary Club, FUDEN and FRS (Spanish NGOs) to strengthen immunization activities. With support from UNICEF and aligned with the GenU Initiative, the Association of Diplomatic Wives organized a gala to collect funds for the Audiovisual School to support aspiring young journalists completing their training at the school.
The challenging funding constraints linked to reduced capacity to mobilise OR (less than 50% mobilized in 2019) compounded with the significant increase of national staff salary (120% average), highlighted the importance of better risk programme analysis during the preparation phase of country programme. Consequently, UNICEF will review its strategic positioning in the country and progressively shift its focus to upstream work to advocate for higher social spending, improved generation of data and evidence, provision of technical support on capacity building and system strengthening, through enhanced shared value partnerships.
 
 
 
"
WCAR,Gabon,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Au terme de la deuxième année du cycle de programme, quelques importantes leçons ont été tirées qui corroborent la pertinence mais aussi les limites des théories de changement quant à la dimension d’intersectorialité et d’intégration. Le réajustement en 2019 de la programmation autour des violences faites aux enfants suivant une approche intégrée présente une opportunité d’innovation programmatique, de maturation et de réplication au niveau d’autres thématiques prioritaires. Les efforts précédemment entrepris ont certes été indispensables, mais sont demeurés insuffisants pour inverser la tendance d’aggravation et de généralisation des violences à l’égard des enfants. Les interventions passées sont parallèles, juxtaposées et couvraient les thématiques suivantes : Violences Basées sur le Genre, Violences en Milieu Scolaire, interdiction des châtiments corporels à l’école, renforcement des capacités des intervenants de la chaîne de protection, lutte contre les grossesses précoces et campagnes de sensibilisation.  Toutefois, les différentes dimensions du cadre global de la réponse, les stratégies et les résultats de ces interventions n’ont jamais fait l’objet d’une approche complète de programmation pluriannuelle et d’intégration intersectorielle.
Pour y remédier, la nouvelle approche de programmation intersectorielle a mobilisé les évidences, les priorités nationales et les contraintes contextuelles ainsi que les modèles, cadres et référents théoriques et les stratégies et initiatives globales et régionales mis en avant par l’UNICEF pour combattre les Violences envers les enfants. Ces fondements ont concerné les ODD, le Plan Stratégique, le modèle d’engagement pour la cause des enfants (Cause Framework- #ENDViolence), les théories de changement des composantes programmatiques Protection de l’Enfant, Développement des Adolescents et Survie, l’Agenda plaidoyer du Programme de Coopération, le Résultat Clef pour les Enfants (KRC) et l’Initiative Generation Unlimited.
Une matrice d’intersectorialité sur les Violences Contre les enfants a été développée et a favorisé des synergies internes entre plusieurs composantes programmatiques induisant ainsi une nouvelle dynamique de collaboration au niveau des administrations publiques de la Justice, de la Police, de l’Éducation nationale, des Affaires Sociales et de la Santé pour lutter contre les violences.
Il s’en est suivi, une démarche globale centrée sur plusieurs types de violences et des interventions qui se situent à plusieurs niveaux prenant en compte les Violences en milieu scolaire, La violence contre les enfants dans la famille/le ménage et la communauté, la violence en milieu carcéral et les violences sexuelles. Cela intervient dans un continuum d’interventions qui couvre toutes les dimensions du phénomène au niveau de l’environnement favorable, de la production d’évidence, des services et des actions de communication pour le changement social. 
S’agissant de l’Environnement favorable l’amélioration sans précèdent du cadre normatif et Institutionnel par la promulgation du Code de l’Enfant et la mise en place d’un dispositif de coordination et de suivi des violences auprès de la Primature ainsi que l’élaboration d’un plan stratégique et l’interdiction des débits de boissons qui ont toujours été, aux alentours des écoles, une source de violences et de menaces pour la sécurité des élèves,  sont autant de changements imprimés par cette nouvelle option.  Concernant le volet production de données l’élaboration d’un profil des violences en milieu scolaire est venue combler un vide de connaissance et de compréhension de l’étendue et de l’ampleur de ces pratiques et ces dénis de droit répandus et sous-documentés. Ces données ont servi pour un plaidoyer basé sur les évidences et pour la programmation pour 2020 et le reste du cycle de programme.
Pour ce qui est des services, la prise en charge des victimes des violences s’est accélérée avec la combinaison des efforts des structures des systèmes de protection et des Organisations de la Sociétés Civile qui ont été mieux impliquées et équipées pour une réponse intégrée. Les capacités de prise en charge ont été renforcées à travers les équipements, la formation et coordination. Les services seront aussi consolidés par l’entremise des mécanismes de lutte contre les violences au sein de toutes les Académies Provinciales à l’échelle du pays qui apporteront des réponses tant sur le plan de la répression des actes de violences que pour les services d’appui psycho-social, d’accès aux services de justices, des affaires sociales et de la santé et de prévention et d’accompagnement des victimes.
Les aspects de communication pour le changement de comportement ont aussi été mis en œuvre avec la participation des agents communautaires et des animateurs des OSC pour sensibiliser sur les méfaits des violences, disséminer les lois qui les répriment et les mesures coercitives subséquentes en vue de détecter les victimes et les référer aux services de prise en charge.
Ces actions ont contribué au renforcement du dialogue et des débats sociaux en faveur de l’élimination de la violence faites aux enfants en encourageant des normes sociales positives, en combattant celles qui sont néfastes et en renforçant les changements structurels en faveur de l’égalité et de l’équité. L’accent a aussi été mis sur la participation des garçons à la prévention et à la lutte contre les violences sexuelles
Ces interventions multisectorielles portées par toutes les composantes de programme concernées, mais aussi par plusieurs segments de pouvoirs publics engagés dans cette collaboration, ont combiné des stratégies de prévention, de protection, de promotion et de transformation sociale qui influencent profondément la réponse aux violences à l’endroit des enfants et jettent les bases d’une programmation plus efficiente.
Les enseignements tirés de cette démarche sont nombreux et bénéfiques pour le programme qui fait face à un sous-financement structurel et à des insuffisances de ressources humaines internes et de capacités des partenaires. Ils permettent d’accélérer les effets transformationnels et les progrès pour les enfants. L’approche sera systématisée et élargie en 2020 avec l’élaboration d’un plan d’action de mesures prioritaires issues de l’étude sur les violences en milieu scolaire, l’organisation d’un forum multisectoriel et de haut niveau sur les Violences et le lancement d’une campagne nationale pour l’installation des mécanismes dans les neuf Provinces du pays. Elle sera aussi testée pour d’autre problématiques complexes et à fort potentiel intersectoriel comme l’enregistrement des naissances qui appelle des interventions de protection et d’inclusion sociale, ainsi que le WASH et ses articulations avec la justice juvénile, l’éducation inclusive et la survie.  
"
WCAR,Gambia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The MTR provided a snapshot of areas of progress and drivers in relation to the country programme document. Of 21 indicators, 33.3 per cent met the target, 19 per cent were on track and the remaining 47.7 per cent were lagging behind or lacked data. The most stagnant indicators were related to behaviour change. To address this delay, a communication for development (C4D) strategy was developed and integrated as an essential component of programme delivery. UNICEF will continue to intensify the application of results-based management principles in its work, while strengthening systems for tracking performance.
The MTR confirmed the strategic value of encouraging local government and other stakeholders to pay greater attention to fulfilling the rights and needs of their youngest citizens and ensuring the latter’s participation in local decision-making. UNICEF will continue, through the Nsa Kenno approach, to work closely with the government and other development partners to localize the SDGs. One bottleneck noted by a 2018 report on the national development plan is the limited resources allocated to local authorities. The ongoing voluntary national review (VNR) process for the SDGs offers a promising opportunity to mobilize wider partnerships and to address this issue nationally. UNICEF and MoFEA staff leading the review attended the conference on national evaluation and VNR in November 2019. Action plans will be implemented, including children’s participation during the VNR process in 2020. Throughout the year, children showed strong willingness and capacity to actively and meaningfully participate in all processes affecting their own development and that of the larger society, as demonstrated at the CNAG, when children presented their recommendations to the Government at the National Assembly.
The Gambia has acceded to most major international treaties, but still has not incorporated some international rights instruments into domestic law. Existing child protection policies are not fully implemented, pointing to a need for broader awareness of these policies and procedures across all decentralized structures. This was echoed by young representatives at the CNAG, especially in relation to child marriage, FGM/C and child labour. UNICEF will continue to play an active role in advocating for and providing technical support for planning, developing and supporting the social service workforce for child protection to strengthen enforcement of relevant laws.
Rapid urbanization was observed as an emerging challenge to addressing child rights issues such as child labour and a healthy environment. Promotion of child-friendly cities and communities could serve as an enabler for addressing multi-sectoral issues related to urbanization. To this end, UNICEF is exploring the possibility of establishing a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Banjul City Council, led by the first female mayor (who successfully launched a local chapter of Elected Women and Territorial Leaders of Africa (REFELA) in 2019), and enhancing partnerships with UNDP and other development partners.
Publication of the MICS6 was a major cross-cutting focus for evidence-based advocacy gains achieved in 2019; however greater efforts are needed, especially the creation of a child protection information system to collect evidence on rampant violence against children.
UNICEF recognized the importance of partnerships during 2019, and. continued to work closely with sister UN agencies with the overarching objectives of increasing the focus on results for children, especially in areas of child marriage and FGM/C; on CRVS, tapping into the large-scale World Bank investment in a social registry; universal health coverage; and full implementation of the business operations strategy and HACT. UNICEF also established close collaboration with the Gambian Chamber of Commerce to advocate for spaces for breastfeeding in establishments and businesses, calling on private firms to invest in family-friendly policies. In addition, UNICEF is currently exploring the possibility of establishing MOUs with the Peace Corp (on education and health) and the University of Gambia (nutrition and social services curricula), in addition to the Banjul City Council, which is expected to take place in early 2020.
The office will continue to promote use of the UN partnership portal for partner selection. Furthermore, collaboration with other UN agencies and partners will be enhanced to ensure synergy and efficiencies under the ‘delivering as one’ principle. Innovative measures will be used to obtain feedback from new staff after three months of appointment to identify immediate needs and challenges and incorporate the effective implementation of progressive supervision prior to the end-of-year appraisal. A review of the learning plan to support programme delivery and staff career aspirations will continue efforts to increase staff motivation and satisfaction. UNICEF Gambia will continue to support efforts to enhance UNICEF core values.   
Looking forward, UNICEF will continue to follow the change pathways agreed to during the MTR, while sharpening its focus on integrated approaches to obtain key results for children in areas such as early childhood development (KRC3), integrated community case management (KRC1) and violence against children (KRC5). This endeavour will be further improved in 2020 by ensuring the participation and contribution of all key stakeholders, including children and youth, who are the leaders of the future as demonstrated clearly during 2019 by the CNAG, U-report and other platforms. The office will maintain its focus on C4D, developing partnerships, evidence-based advocacy and innovation. Technology for development initiatives are planned to continue collaboration on innovation between UNICEF and UNDP, in response to the country’s development needs.
The U-Report initiative shows great potential to advance child rights, and could be explored further (such as through
real-time monitoring via Rapid Pro) in collaboration with UNICEF in Sierra Leone. UNICEF Gambia will also explore the potential for scaling up digital birth registration, and – to strengthen transparency, flexibility and accountability – the office will explore other methods of making payments to beneficiaries, such as mobile payments or virtual cash wallets. At the same time, UNICEF will continue to support the development of strong, effective institutions that respond to the demands of informed and empowered communities to realize the rights of all children in the Gambia.
"
WCAR,Ghana,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"There were notable lessons and innovations in 2019 related to emerging programme focus areas with implications for UNICEF’s programme strategies in Ghana in 2020.
1. Key Results for Children in Ghana
The 2019 country office annual management plan set out the overall strategic contributions of the country programme to five of the eight Key Results for Children (KRCs) for WCAR (immunization, stunting, learning outcomes, child marriage and open defecation). Emphasis was placed on inter-sectoral coordination and monitoring to enable effective contributions by office programme sectors. The CO Programme Group Meeting was used as regular forum for updates against KRC targets (in line with WCAR framework) by result manager and RG contributors. The strong alignment between the result frameworks of the KRCs and the country programme greatly facilitated mid- and end-year reviews and communication on KRCs with external partners.  In 2019, the Representative was co-chair of the working group for the KRC on Ending child marriage and partially KRC8 WG on Ending open defecation. The Groups promoted coordination between offices in WCAR and facilitated the sharing of best practices and innovation to accelerate results. Based on regional lessons learned so far, the office will continue prioritising the following strategies to address remaining bottlenecks: Public Finance for Children, advocacy, social/behavioral change, and partnerships. In 2020, UNICEF Ghana will undertake a mid-term review of the country programme, with a focus on progress to date, facilitating factors and constraints. This exercise will help identify strategies to further accelerate results for children.
Programming for at-scale results for children - Illustration - Learning outcomes (KRC): 
The 'Student Teacher Accountability Reporting System' (STARS) initiative aims at improving learning outcomes for children through targeted instruction, and is one of the UNICEF-supported models in Education due to be brought to scale under GALOP in 2020. Over 10,000 low performing schools across Ghana will implement STARS based on the experience gained from 140 schools. The pathway to scale and sustainability provides useful lessons for the country programme on the importance of the design process and securing government ownership early on.

Firstly, STARS comprised an evidence-based design process grounded in existing government systems and structures. This process considered evidence on targeted instruction and engaged stakeholders from the service delivery chain in an active community of practice. 
Secondly, structured opportunities were created to facilitate partnerships between the key agencies that were critical for implementation (i.e. curriculum, training, school inspection and implementation). A two-tier coordination structure facilitated decision-making and communication including at national and sub-national levels. A technical team met regularly to plan for key project activities, lead implementation, conduct monitoring, and report on progress. A steering committee comprised of agency directors and technical officers met on a quarterly basis to oversee progress and address bottlenecks. 
Thirdly, while the intervention was designed as an impact evaluation, timely process monitoring encouraged shorter feedback loops and enabled education staff to assess their efforts by monitoring children’s progress from one ability group to another - a factor which increased motivation and compliance.
Combined with further evidence from costing and analysis, the three components underpinned the sustainability of STARS and facilitated its incorporation into GALOP, which will be catalytic in accelerating progress in improving learning outcomes for children (a Key Result for Children in WCAR).
Notwithstanding development assistance, fiscal space in the social sectors remained limited overall, reducing opportunities for child-sensitive investments through the national budget. Various sector initiatives in 2019, such as the Health Sector Financing Summit by the MoH, also highlighted limited knowledge among sector actors on decision-making processes behind budget formulation. In 2019, the UNICEF office in Ghana invested in strengthening staff capacity on public financial management (PFM). As a result, staff members intensified support to line ministries around budget formulation and interaction with the MoF. Sector budget briefs were also developed to provide child-sensitive analysis and budget policy recommendations. PFM support will continue to be prioritised in 2020 towards key results for children, including in relation to nutrition (i.e. the elimination of stunting) and sanitation (i.e. the elimination of open defecation).
 
2. Partnerships for children - Harnessing the power of business and markets for children
In 2019, the office continued to explore multi-stakeholder partnerships for children and young people with the business sector, including transformative partnerships in finance, healthcare, sanitation and technology. 
The office continued to cooperate closely with the APEX Bank and rural banks in Ghana, to enable households and small businesses to borrow money and build toilets. The rapid uptake of the UNICEF-supported Basic Sanitation Fund loans in early 2019 evinced household willingness to access financing for toilets, with concurrent research indicating 90% utilization of acquired toilet by households. On the one hand, some constraints tempered loan uptake, as the 12 per cent interest rate remains unaffordable for the poorest households, with uneven application of lending criteria by banks, and the relatively high costs of latrines. On the other hand, the BSF presented a scalable, market shaping approach for public and private financing to expand and widen its availability. Competing sanitation financing approaches by some IFIs/DPs (including full and partial subsidization and pro-poor targeting) may however be slowing progress to eliminate open defecation in Ghana. In 2020, the MoSWR will lead an assessment of sanitation financing models and their sustainability, which shall inform Government strategies.
UNICEF and ILO have been discussing a transformative public-private partnership with the cocoa industry around the elimination of child labour in cocoa supply chains. This has been involving multiple actors - including UNICEF headquarters, regional and country offices, ILO HQ and RO, government and industry representatives, Cocobod, WCF and ICI - and has required significant contributions from office staff in due diligence, content development, and relationship management at technical and strategic levels.
 
3. Harnessing the power of evidence and innovation as a driver of change for children

Strengthening Data Systems. Evidence suggests that the Mother & Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative was instrumental in reducing institutional maternal and neonatal deaths. However, recent analysis of coverage of health services versus their impact on health outcomes highlighted the lack of clear denominators and data to cover a wider range of information gaps (e.g. quality of care, where child and maternal mortality is taking place and why). On-going collaboration with the GHS and University of Manitoba will seek to bridge data gaps and systematize systems to track coverage and quality of health services.
Environmental Health. With climate change effects and rapid urbanization in Ghana, the children in urban areas are exposed to higher vulnerabilities and are more likely to suffer the negative impacts of environmental degradation. Studies are already showing heightened exposure to lead poisoning among children living in urban slums in Ghana. In partnership with GHS and CSOs, UNICEF plans to expand its focus to urban areas, to assess and prevent factors that can affect adversely the health of children.
Child Online protection. The internet has proliferated the spread of child sexual abuse images and messages, sexual and non-sexual harassment, and sextortion. Easily retrieval and sharing of content implies recurring harm to survivors that complicates actions to address online child sexual exploitation and abuse. While efforts have been made in Ghana since 2017, 2019 data shows an exponential increase in mobile internet use in Ghana, reaching 10 million subscriptions and the concerning increase in reported cases in child exploitation online - from 620 in 2016 to over 7,000 in 2019 (National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children Cyber Tipline Report). Actions responding to the situation must be innovative and situated within an overall child protection system response and include all influential actors from the telecommunications and ICT sectors. In this regard, UNICEF is supporting the Ghana Police Services to establish a dedicated digital forensic laboratory and increase prosecution rates (5.3 per cent in 2018).
 
4. United Nations working together in Ghana - Decade of Action and Acceleration
In line with the SDG Agenda 2030, the UNICEF Strategic Plan and the UNSDP for Ghana, UNICEF continued to be an active member of the UNCT. The office delivered results through two joint programmes on adolescent girls, worked closely with WHO around the polio campaigns, and contributed to UN joint advocacy efforts. UNICEF also shared capacity and knowledge on various initiatives ranging from supporting Ghana’s Voluntary National Review to emergency response. The UNICEF-GoG country programme is aligned with the objectives of the UNSDP, which UNICEF supports in five of eight outcome areas. As Chair of the UNSDP Result Area Two on “Social Investment in People”, the Data Group and Inter-Agency group on Emergencies, UNICEF played a prominent role in the formulation, coordination, review and coherence of UN joint work plans. In addition, through its field presence in Tamale, UNICEF played a key role in ensuring the safety and security of UN staff in the north of Ghana. In 2020, the office will continue to develop and implement UN joint programmes and will coordinate with the UNCT in relation to risk informed programming, especially considering the situation in the Central Sahel.  
"
WCAR,Guinea,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"A critical lesson learned in 2019 was the need for better coordination of education actors. Despite a formal commitment by development partners to align with the sectoral policy, partners of the Ministry of Education follow different funding modalities and approaches without any space for sharing of information. It is thus often difficult to find synergies and complementarities. In addition, Ministry of Education services are overloaded with meetings related to procedures with partners, and this often prevents them from carrying out all planned internal missions and from fully achieved results. Strong leadership from Government, combined with thematic spaces for exchange with technical and financial support from partners, has the potential of helping better unite all stakeholders and making interventions effective and achieve impactful results. Coordination of education actors at the local level and discussion of statistics are necessary, with quality deconcentrated structures to provide guidance and help in solving problems.
The Ministry of Education, with support from UNICEF, launched 3 innovative initiatives to contribute to local governance and decentralization. The first one is making more operational the 42 Primary Education Delegates of the Convergence Municipalities and strengthening their capacity to deliver. They benefited from motorcycles and computers, as well as capacity building on administrative and pedagogical leadership, preschool teachers coaching and basic computer literacy. The second innovation consisted in the pilot of a performance-based financing approach for the municipalities, with reinforced Mayors’ involvement in Education matters. The evaluation of their performance is still to be held (first quarter of 2020), but this approach has already generated a strong enthusiasm for achieving results and awareness on the essential role of local authorities in the adequate functioning of schools. UNICEF's contribution through subsidies to municipalities led to communities spontaneously building 18 additional Preschool centers with their own funds. Finally, the results-based financing and the accountability of local authorities have proven to be in their interest and have put them in the driving seat of the growth of the education sector in their municipality. However, accompanying measures and continuous communication are essential to the success of the programme.
The third innovation was the use of tablets to manage schools’ human, material and pedagogical resources, thus enabling school principals to communicate online with Primary Education Delegates, sending them weekly basic data on children and teachers’ attendance, progress of  teaching program, status of supplies and financial and school implementation plan. At the same time, tablets enabled the school to receive digital pedagogical material and videos.
To strengthen community health implementation, improve immunization coverage and ensure the effectiveness of services offered in the 40 convergence municipalities, Ministries of Health and of Territorial Administration and Decentralization, with UNICEF support, introduced in 2019 a new mechanism to address  large discrepancies between administrative data and survey data. This mechanism tested in four municipalities, consists in a comprehensive census of all children 0-59 months and pregnant women through community mapping and household level census. This exercise revealed that targets identified through community mapping and household level census were sometimes twice higher (1,056 against 427) than estimates provided by projections using 2014 population and housing census. In addition, a digital application for household level individual child tracking was developed in one municipality to catch up which children have not been vaccinated and which are not fully vaccinated. Coupled with the community mapping, it contributed to facilitate children census and immunization coverage real-time monitoring. In municipalities covered, this innovation contributed to improve the control of targeted population, data quality as well as capacity of data managers. As this mechanism add real  value, UNICEF has successfully advocated for its adoption by the Government, as a key condition for the scale-up of community health interventions and monitoring. In 2020, UNICEF will position this initiative as an office priority to support the Government to consolidate and expand community health nationwide.
The Ministry responsible for water and sanitation, with UNICEF support and as part of Community Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) strategy implementation, has put local governments (municipalities) in the driving seat for all phases (planning, management and monitoring) of interventions, working closely with NGOs and technical services. Furthermore, CLTS was implemented in all villages of a target municipalities, leading to ownership and accountability of these entities. The approach has led to excellent results beyond expectations (1,942 communities ODF for a target of 700). In 2019, the programme has undergone a strategic shift from target villages to whole municipalities for the attainment of ODF status.
"
WCAR,Guinea Bissau,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons learned from 2019 show the need for the country office to constantly review and adapt its programmes to respond to the many challenges facing Guinea-Bissau.
One of the main constraints faced by the country office in 2019 related to the stockout of crucial vaccines for children including polio (bOPV) and tetanus and diphtheria vaccines (Td), which are the vaccines traditionally funded by the government. Advocacy efforts with the new government, sworn-in in July 2019, shed light on the financial difficulties faced by the government to fund these vaccines on a regular basis. As an innovative approach, UNICEF has started searching for alternative funding sources (i.e. private sector) to avoid the recurrence of this situation. UNICEF has also embarked on a multisectoral effort, which will be rolled-out next year, aimed at strengthening the capacity of line ministries, in particular MoH and MoE to better plan and use their scarce resources.
In the area of child protection, the major lesson learned related to the successful partnership built with a number of actors to engage in upstream work and improve policy and legal frameworks in a very unstable political context. UNICEF partnered with other UN agencies (i.e. UNIOGBIS, UNFPA, UNDP, IOM, UN Women and UNODC), NGOs, and other civil society organizations and led the establishment of a strong sector coordination system that has helped advance the child protection agenda, in particular, the process of harmonization of the national legislation with the Convention of the Rights of the Child and the reform of the civil registration and vital statistics systems. UNICEF also used its joint programmes with UNDP and UNFPA, together with sister agencies, to voice concerns as “one UN” on human rights issues affecting women and girls and to ensure issues of relevance for women and girls are included in the legal reform process. UNICEF Guinea-Bissau is planning to adopt the same approach, consolidating partnerships to accelerate progress on the establishment of an effective child protection system and leverage resources to maximize results on birth registration.
With the aim of accelerating progress on the achievement of the key result of eliminating open defecation in the region, and successfully monitoring the Community-Led Total Sanitation programme (CLTS) the WASH sector has continued using and strengthening the cloud-based database that makes it possible to update WASH data from any smartphone or computer connected to the Internet. The system allows for the mapping of all Guinea-Bissau’s villages (official villages, based on 2009 census), as well as a selected number of schools, health centres, and waterpoints. Data visualization allows to strategically focus interventions for the WASH sector in areas that have not yet been targeted, and has helped to plan future interventions, follow-up visits and retention of ODF status in villages. The WASH monitoring system is now the official government system for waterpoint functionality and for ODF certification. In 2019, the monitoring of WASH in health facilities was added to the database. Internally, the system has allowed UNICEF Guinea-Bissau to properly manage and register interventions, take the opportunity for programme convergence and improve prioritization of interventions to accelerate progress on the agreed regional key results for children (KRC). It has created conditions conducive to addressing other issues affecting children at village level by facilitating the implementation of multi-sectoral interactions and a phased approach where interventions can easily be sequenced. The tool will be used by UNICEF Guinea-Bissau to expand the same monitoring platform to more programmes, thus increasing convergence between programmes to achieve the KRC.
Another lesson learned was that fostering sustainable and positive behaviour change at community level required sustained dialogue and meaningful participation of traditional and religious leaders and healers. While UNICEF Guinea-Bissau has relied on CHW and NGOs to help communities acquire knowledge on issues affecting children, engagement with traditional and religious leaders has proved to be very effective for prompting desired behaviours and practices at community level. A good example of this engagement is the Guinea-Bissau Country Office’s support to the “Vaccine Leaders’ Forum” and sectoral social mobilization committees for routine vaccination and birth registration promotion, where opinion leaders and leaders of different traditional and religious groups have taken an active role in disseminating educational content and messages, promoting changes in attitudes, practices and behaviours. This has proved to be a good approach to accelerate results towards reaching targets around the regional KRC on immunization and birth registration. Their influence has greatly contributed to triggering families’ willingness to adopt good practices, including the use of latrines, washing hands with soap or ash, and other good behavioural practices that improve living conditions of the families and the overall community.
Similarly, the partnership developed with civil society actors on social accountability and social budgeting has been key to making advances on data generation and the design of advocacy initiatives on social budgeting. However, the experience also highlighted the importance of engaging with national institutions to foster their interests on social budgeting in order to ensure the sustainability of interventions and the continued development of sound public policies and budget processes that take children into account.
"
WCAR,Liberia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons learned

The main lessons learned during 2019 were the dividends that come from long term investment in proven interventions, particularly those that work at grass roots, decentralized level especially through the CHA programme which is increasingly recognized as the most viable platform to deliver an integrated and multi-sectorial package of public health interventions, including birth registration, especially to the most vulnerable and hard to reach populations.
In 2019, the CHA programme demonstrated promising results in terms of ensuring interoperability between immunization and birth registration at the grass roots level. Birth registration has been mainstreamed in the CFC health workers training curriculum. Coupled with the change strategy of establishing 26 Birth Registration centres in hospitals, this resulted in bringing the birth registration services closer to the communities.
The volunteering spirit of the CHAs and CHVs who are from the communities and serving the communities further helped in addressing the lack of motivation, which were the challenges/bottlenecks previously faced by health workers and their involvement in birth registration, despite being mandated to play an important role. CHAs and CHVs supported the accelerated birth registration campaigns alongside the birth registration staff (registrars and data entry clerks) which was one of the contributing factors of the significant increase of children being registered and certified in 2019. For example, in Bong and Grand Gedeh counties where CHAs and CHVs played a proactive role during the birth registration mop up campaigns, with seven Birth Registration centres also established in communities, there was a significant increase in the number of children under 1 being registered and certified. Compared to 2018, a 25 per cent and 24 per cent increase was seen in Bong and Grand Gedeh counties respectively.
Further, as we move into the new country programme with a renewed ambition of ensuring Birth Registration for all children under 1 by 2030, bottlenecks were identified including the need to empower and legitimize the roles of CHAs and CHVs in birth registration.  Despite their proactive role in raising awareness about the significance of Birth Registration and serving as an interlocutor between the health facility Birth Registration staff and the families, the insistence of families to pick up the certificates or Birth Registration staff in health facilities deliver the certificates during the campaigns has been identified as a challenge.
CHAs can and should be empowered to directly deliver birth certificates to families in communities, especially in hard to reach areas and not only serve as a referral point. Another lesson learned moving forward is the importance of leveraging partner resources to sustain the CHA programme. In 2020, UNICEF will continue to advance the policy dialogue for CHAs and support the development and finalization of the CHA implementation road map. Evidence generation, including costing analysis of this powerful grass roots initiative needs to be coupled with a proven argument of sustainability, scalability and cost effectiveness.
Innovations

Alongside the constrained fiscal space, various ministries were unable to disburse UNICEF funds within the required time frame which caused major bottlenecks to programme implementation in health, education and child protection. In response to a cash liquidity issue, the Ministry of Education in cooperation with UNICEF piloted the use of mobile money services to pay over 1,300 teachers attending the October â€“ November teacherâ€™s training sessions outside Monrovia, worth US$22,590. A UNICEF assessment of the piloted mobile money services demonstrated robustness of the modality for scale up in 2020. Â 
As well as resolving the issue of distributing funds to where they were needed and in a timely, efficient manner, this method also mitigated risks previously identified in UNICEFâ€™s internal audit procedures, such as availability of cash or handling of large amounts of money by Government staff in the field.
In a country like Liberia where there is a dearth of qualified service providers (10.7 health workers per 10,000 persons against the WHO standard of 23 skilled health workers per 10,000 persons), task-sharing is an innovative approach to bridge the gap created by inadequate human resources for health in order to ensure that services are provided to newborns, children and women, especially in hard-to-reach areas. Accordingly, UNICEF in partnership with the Ministry of Health, WHO and UNFPA partnered with Maternal Child Advocacy International, an international NGO, to pilot a task-sharing approach that facilitates effective and efficient delivery of advanced emergency obstetric and newborn care in health facilities with limited numbers of doctors. Through this pilot programme, mid-level professionals (e.g. nurses, midwives) who have been trained in the requisite knowledge and skills are providing medical, surgical, obstetric and neonatal care that would normally be provided only by a doctor, enabling more widespread service provision and delivering life-saving interventions to mothers and children especially those in hard-to-reach areas.
A total of 16 clinicians have been trained under the initiative, with UNICEF supporting the deployment of three clinicians (one obstetric clinician and two neonatal clinicians) to the Martha Tubman Hospital in Grand Gedeh County as part of the task-sharing approach. Between April and September 2019, two of these trained neonatal clinicians were able to successfully manage 45 out of 54 cases of neonatal asphyxia (83.3 per cent). Over the same period, the trained obstetric clinician was able to successfully manage 131 obstetric complications. These clinicians are all women, thus contributing to womenâ€™s empowerment and gender goals as well as maternal and new-born health.
Based on the impressive preliminary results, the Government, UN agencies and MCAI developed a US$5 million proposal to scale up this innovation and submitted it to the Global Financing Facility. The proposal was among the 16 shortlisted proposals out of a total of 300 applications."
WCAR,Mali,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Joint advocacy and shared value partnership proved to be effective strategies to invest more resources to accelerate results for children in a sustainable way and promote Government accountability and ownership, despite the pressure on the national budget to raise the share of security expenses while decreasing the ones on social services. In addition, it was a very efficient strategy to link humanitarian to development efforts by working with two EU institutions- DEVCO and ECHO for a common strategy to gradually reduce dependence on external funding for RUTF and strengthen governmental system.
Maternal and child malnutrition has remained a serious public health issue in Mali for many years. The Government has long recognized the importance of good nutrition for economic and social development with the adoption in 2013 of a multisectoral nutrition policy and making the fight against malnutrition one of the key objectives of its 2016-2018 national development plan. However, despite this apparent commitment of the Government, the nutrition policy activities have remained gravely underfunded. A budget analysis conducted in 2019 showed that merely 0.7 per cent of government spending are allocated to nutrition. Nutrition specific interventions such as the management of Severe Acute Malnutrition rely entirely on bilateral and multilateral partners’ funding, which has shown a declining trend for the past few years.
In this context, UNICEF in Mali, jointly with the EU and ECHO, championed advocacy and technical support for alternative funding sources and more robust Government commitment and investment to ensure adequate funding for nutrition over the short and medium term, notably the Acute Malnutrition programme. UNICEF and EU-ECHO also actively engaged in a humanitarian-development nexus work to leverage funding from both humanitarian and development partners while pursuing the dual objective.
The European Union Delegation’s (EU) 50 million Euros programme (Food Security, Nutrition, and Sustainable Agriculture Sector Reform Contract - SANAD), which had been implemented since 2017 offered a great opportunity to influence the Government budget for children. The SANAD provided a combination of sectoral budget support and technical assistance to improve governance, strengthen public finance management, and reinforce monitoring and evaluation systems.
Together, the EU, ECHO, and UNICEF agreed on the need to strengthen the integration into the health system of services for the management of acute malnutrition, notably the integration of Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) into the Master Supply Plan and the increase of Government’s allocation to nutrition specific activities.
The negotiations between the EU and the Government of Mali resulted in € 8 million being allocated to the Government for reinforcing the nutrition component of the SANAD and the inclusion of conditionalities linked to nutrition in the signed programme agreement. Specifically, the Government committed to (i) include the RUTF into the national list of essential medicines; (ii) develop a road map for the effective integration of RUTF into the Master Supply Plan; and (iii) purchase and distribute 12,000 cartons of RUTF in 2020 and 24,000 cartons in 2021.
To support these efforts, UNICEF in Mali entered into a partnership with the EU to provide technical support to the Government to implement specific actions that will support the National Nutrition Policy and the nutrition-related objectives of the SANAD.
Going forward, UNICEF will build on this successful experience to engage in joint advocacy with other financial and technical partners in Mali to leverage more public finance for children (PF4C). As an example, UNICEF is already working to emulate the successful model with the World Bank’s general budget support.
"
WCAR,Mauritania,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Pour répondre auxenjeux clés qui consistent à faire converger les interventions thématiques et à opérationnaliser les actions au niveau régional où se concentrent les défis fragilisant la mise en œuvre, le bureau a intensifié ses efforts afin de : (i) démontrer/documenter la validité, l’efficience et la pérennité des politiques et stratégies nationales au niveau opérationnel dans le but d’influencer la prise de décisions et les ajustements nécessaires, (ii) identifier et corriger les goulots d’étranglement ayant un impact négatif sur la mise en œuvre des activités opérationnelles et l’atteinte de résultats tangibles pour les enfants, (iii) accorder une attention adéquate aux diversités socio-culturelles, aux dynamiques de population et aux nouvelles problématiques des milieux péri-urbains et iv) améliorer l’efficacité et l’efficience des programmes.
Le plaidoyer auprès des PTF, particulièrement, la Banque mondiale, l’Union européenne et l'AFD pour influencer les investissements dans des secteurs clés (Santé-nutrition, éducation, protection sociale, WASH, jeunesse), particulièrement dans les régions affectées par l’extrême pauvreté ou des situations humanitaires a été poursuivi. La convergence d’au moins trois interventions pour améliorer la qualité des soins maternels et néonataux/adolescents au niveau communautaire doit être poursuivie. Dans le cadre de la mise en œuvre du plan stratégique de santé communautaire, l’approche locale a permis d’accélérer les processus de formation et d’installation des agents de santé communautaire. Les défis résident dans leur supervision et leur approvisionnement en médicaments et intrants.
Devant la récurrence des sécheresses, il s’avère nécessaire de poursuivre le plaidoyer pour assurer une contribution de l’État au plan de financement du programme de prise en charge de la malnutrition aiguë sévère. Grâce à l’accompagnement de l’UNICEF, la Mauritanie est un des rares pays à avoir contribué à la plateforme d’optimisation de la chaîne de froid (CCEOP) sur fonds du gouvernement.
L’engagement dans le dialogue sectoriel a permis des avancées notables et le développement de nouveaux plans sectoriels (santé, éducation, protection sociale, jeunesse) prévu en 2020 offrent de belles opportunités stratégiques pour poursuivre l’atteinte des KRC. Dans le secteur WASH, toutefois, la mise en place d’une coordination sectorielle, la construction d’un secteur résilient aux changement climatiques et l’accès aux nouveaux financements liés aux changements climatiques tels que le GEF et GCF ainsi que l’élargissement des partenariats stratégiques aboutissant à des financements pluriannuels demeurent des défis importants.
Bien que l’insertion des enfants hors de l’école dépasse la cible visée par le programme, la durabilité du mécanisme d’insertion est loin d’être garantie et le suivi des cohortes insérées doit faire l’objet d’engagement ferme des autorités éducatives accueillant ces enfants. Grâce à un partenariat avec le bureau UNICEF Mali, la fourniture de plus de 19000 manuels scolaires officiels du Mali a été assurée en faveur des enfants réfugiés du camp de M’Berra.
Le bureau a intensifié ses efforts en matière d’innovation. En 2020, le projet Wellness Pass en partenariat avec GAVI, Master Card, OMS et Gifted Mom, pourrait contribuer à réduire le gap de couverture, via un identifiant unique. Le projet d’éducation numérique pour l’apprentissage du français au profit des enfants déscolarisés est désormais opérationnel au sein d’un dispositif impliquant un centre de formation supérieur de l’Université de Nouakchott et un centre d’insertion d’enfants non scolarisés, situé dans un quartier périphérique de Nouakchott. La collecte de données en temps réel (RTM) via Rapid Pro a amélioré les informations au Guidimakha et au Hodh Chargui en particulier pour le suivi de l’ANJE. Le lancement de U-Report est envisagé en 2020, tout comme celui de PRIMERO qui permettra de faciliter l'aiguillage entre les services de protection et les bénéficiaires. Le système d’information et de gestion de l’éducation testera une approche pour le suivi de l’absentéisme des enseignants. Dans le secteur WASH, un système d’information est développé pour le suivi de l’état des infrastructures en eau potable ainsi qu’une cartographie pour l’identification des localités sur biseau sec. Enfin, des innovations non technologiques sont à l’étude en matière d’éducation nutritionnelle pour réaliser des actions auprès des populations vulnérables ou difficiles à atteindre et n’ayant pas accès aux technologies. Enfin, le bureau compte renforcer son engagement avec le secteur privé afin d’assurer une meilleure couverture des services sociaux de base et contribuant à l’atteinte des KRC.
Avec un agenda de la protection sociale renforcé par le nouveau gouvernement, les partenaires du secteur ont prévu une mise à l’échelle d’un modèle intégré de protection sociale au Guidimakha (Financement SDG Fund/Leave no one Behind; UNICEF-lead; PAM et BIT) qui permettrait de coordonner les différentes initiatives de protection sociale dès février 2020, jusque-là, exécutées de manières fragmentées, afin de maximiser leurs impacts auprès des populations vulnérables et de réajuster certains ciblages d’interventions, afin de ne laisser personne pour compte. Le projet intégré UNICEF/PAM sur la résilience financée par la BMZ offrira une unique opportunité de maximiser les synergies d’intervention à tous les niveaux et ainsi démontrer des résultats probants afin qu’aucun enfant ne soit laissé pour compte en plus de renforcer la cohérence entre l'action humanitaire et la programmation à plus long terme. Ce projet intensifiera l’utilisation de l’énergie solaire dans les programmes d’hydraulique villageoise afin de mieux appréhender la dimension changement climatique dans la programmation WASH.
Les revues à mi-parcours du CPD et du CPDD planifiées en 2020 permettra de revoir la contribution à l’atteinte des résultats clés pour les enfants (KRC/ODD) et assurera de le suivi des observations du Comité des droits de l’enfant. Le bureau accompagnera le pays dans les processus des rapports UPR et CIDPH.
En ligne avec les recommandations du Bulletin du SG visant la tolérance zéro, et suite à la réception d’une importante contribution RR Set Aside, le bureau poursuivra ses efforts en matière de prévention de l’exploitation et des abus sexuels par la mise en œuvre de son plan d’action. Le bureau finalisera également sa stratégie de prévention de la fraude.
Enfin, dans un contexte de la Présidence mauritanienne du G5 Sahel, et en collaboration avec le BR, il sera important de développer une série d’« investment cases » et d’évènements qui permettront de créer des espaces de dialogue et des dynamiques sociales en faveur des enfants.
"
WCAR,Niger,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In 2019, UNICEF Niger started to operate a strategic shift from a predominantly service-delivery mode to more investments in systems strengthening and capacity-building for sustainable solutions. To accelerate key results for children, innovative approaches were developed in support to these principles, particularly regarding support to decentralization, youth and technological innovation agendas, including the underlying elements of social accountability and participatory planning and budgeting at municipal level.
UNICEF worked to operationalize the WASH municipality-wide approach based on public-private partnerships (PPP). In addition to improving the quality and sustainability of the service and the accountability to users, the PPP through the delegated management of the water supply piped systems can offer opportunities for youth employment. Given this potential opportunity for private operators to hire competent youths for management of the piped systems, UNICEF is planning to pilot an initiative for the promotion of PPP in the Diffa region as of 2020.
For decentralization, UNICEF also worked through an innovative consortium to align vision and efforts on citizen’s voice, engagement and inclusive participation, as well as public finance for social sectors through two interlinked partnerships: one with GIZ (ProDEC) and WFP, focused on joint design and piloting of inclusive participation in local development and taxation; the second with the World Bank focused on citizen engagement and social accountability, access to budget information and capacity building of social actors to analyze social sectors’ budgets.
Around the youth agenda, UNICEF Niger participated in the Generation Unlimited initiative, launching a call to young people to find innovative solutions to problems identified in their communities. UNICEF strengthened its youth-led advocacy efforts in 2019 with Niger’s participation to the YouthConnekt Africa initiatives. UNICEF and partners initiated a series of #TEDTalks, bringing together youths, innovators and thought-leaders to showcase solutions on issues confronting young people and on the “Niger They Want”. New ways to empower adolescent girls were tested through a video participatory workshop enabling them to exchange experiences, direct and produce a series of video on the way they see their world, tell their own stories and shed light on challenges they face. UNICEF and partners supported the national competition e-Takara and the newly-created e-Takara Junior promoting co-creation of solutions that have the potential to deliver results by and for young people and children. Formal alliance with digital influencers helped UNICEF expand its reach and engagement through digital platforms and social media. These innovative experiences consolidated UNICEF’s belief that interventions have more impact when fully thought through and conducted directly by youth associations. Hence, it will become critical in 2020 to focus on youth associations as change multipliers, and further empower them through capacity building.
UNICEF also used technology to improve social services for children, particularly through strengthening of quality information systems for effective decision-making. UNICEF supported the Health Information Management System (HMIS) enhancement with the introduction and a gradual scale-up of the District Health Information System (DHIS-2) platform , a key step forward towards effective resource alignment and program implementation management at decentralized level, for Integrated Reproductive, Maternal, Neonatal, Child and Adolescent Health and Nutrition. 
In the education sector, the Data Must Speak initiative (DMS) aimed to achieve increased equity in access to education and improved learning outcomes by making available and maximizing the usefulness of existing education data. With the Connect My School initiative, UNICEF Niger supported 600 children across five regions in learning tablet-based mathematics and French lessons, increasing their scores by almost 50% at the primary level. Best practice lessons were filmed and produced to support pedagogical development of teachers, who were also coached through WhatsApp and Skype in Diffa region. In the child protection sector, the implementation of CPIMS+ project aimed at improving case management in Niger. It became also a catalyzer for improving quality and consistency of the case management response, in partnership with the Ministry of Child Protection. CPIMS+ will be fully operational in 2020.
Lessons learned were focused on UNICEF’s role as facilitator and convener, partnerships with the private sector, decentralization and resilience. UNICEF’s role as a principled, but neutral convener and facilitator of game-changing strategies and processes bringing together all sector’s actors, starting from the top leadership of the Government until all technical and financial partners, was successfully modelled in the education sector. 2019 saw the culmination of a process built over the years, requiring a combination of heavily technical support (on data, sectoral analysis), communication and advocacy skills particularly on politically sensitive subjects, high-level political advocacy, and very strong coordination and mediation skills. Through this experience, we learned the time and resource-intensity that these processes require of UNICEF in the country context of Niger, and we will bring lessons learned into 2020 and beyond, particularly to ensure UNICEF can play a similar role in other key sectors.
Reflections on decentralization also touched UNICEF programme implementation and monitoring modalities, as the need was highlighted to deepen the decentralization of UNICEF’s programme. In response, UNICEF has strengthened the human resources base in zonal offices, redistributed presence according to the concentration of programme activities, and has worked on an accountability framework of zonal offices which will be operationalized in 2020. In 2020, UNICEF will also be supporting the Niger-UNICEF CPD coordination ministry to undertake a review of the CPD sub-national coordination mechanisms to inform their enhancement.
In several results areas of UNICEF work in Niger, partnerships with the private sector emerged as key to move forward on critical agendas such as the prevention of stunting, and the financing of WASH investments at decentralized level. In 2019, UNICEF conducted an initial mapping of the private sector in Niger, which highlighted the need to deepen the analysis and develop a specific private sector engagement strategy focused on the business sectors with the highest potential to contribute to results for children. The private sector engagement strategy is expected to be finalized in the second quarter 2020.
Finally, considering the increased number of people affected by the multiple and complex emergencies in the country, and climate change and associated events, empowering authorities and communities at local, departmental, regional, national level to withstand and prepare for shocks is critical. Therefore, resilience building will increasingly constitute a focus of UNICEF’s work. During 2020, UNICEF plans to model and operationalize an integrated municipal and community development approach integrating a strong element of resilience and risk reduction.

WCAR,Nigeria,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The following leasons were learnt and innovations implemented in 2019 to further strengthen the achievement of the highlighted results.
KRC1 Immunization
Overall funding, inadequate supplies, poor referral linkage between community and the health facilities, inadequate coordination and low service immunization service uptake have all created a pressure on UNICEF when implementing activities as planned and achieving results as intended.  They were addressed through the high-level advocacy and technical support in priority states, engagements with low-performing LGAs and following the quarterly LQAS exercises, for capacity development in BNA and CA and drawing plans for corrective measures.  In addition, UNICEF supported the development of a community-based insurance in some selected settlements.
Alignment of partners efforts at all levels is indispensable to success. With the advent of the national strategy for immunization and primary Health care systems strengthening, planning processes of development partners and government have been further streamlined under the leadership of federal and states authority within revitalized coordination structures.  In addition, regular reliable assessment of performance (LQAS) to guide engagement with poor performing states/LGA serves not only to provide corrective measures, but also build capacity at the decentralized level. Such undertakings need to be expanded beyond the immunization group for a more holistic approach to PHC systems strengthening. 
 
KRC2 Prevention of Stunting 
Effectiveness and functionality of the multisectoral committees on food and Nutrition at all levels provided an opportunity for partnership and leveraging resources across ministries, departments, and agencies thereby helping to mitigate the effect of the high political turnover and delay in appointment of heads of government ministries, departments and agencies at all levels following the 2018 election.
UNICEF implemented an adolescent nutrition programme during the year, the first of its kind in Nigeria. Together with the Government, we have noted that the programme is filling a critical gap in the life cycle approach to nutrition in Nigeria, especially in the context where girls give birth to their first child during adolescence. Thus, a decision was taken to scale up the programme in other states.
The planned roll out of ”ZERO Water Campaign” to reach more mothers and other care givers with behavior change messages will improve exclusive breastfeeding, thereby addressing myths and cultural norms especially in Northern Nigeria constraints the promotion and adoption of improved child care practices. 
 
KRC3 Equitable and sustainable access to education and KRC4 Improved Learning Outcomes
Community household mapping of OOSC was carried out through a real data monitoring system that improves economy, efficiency and effectiveness. Data collection is conducted by enumerators by smartphones or tablet which cut costs, provided real-time feedback and reduced data error.
UNICEF’s innovative programme “Teaching at the Right Level” (TaRL), was found to be a viable remedial approach in Nigeria that supports learners with reading and numeracy deficiencies and has been scaled up to more schools and states.
 
KRC5 Protection of children from violence and exploitation, including in humanitarian contexts, and KRC 7 Birth Registration
 
While advocacy efforts continue to intensify for the domestication of the 2003 CRA across the remaining 11 northern states of Nigeria, the planned targets for domestication may need to be adjusted to allow more dialogue with key change makers to avoid child rights legislation including provisions that legitimize child marriage.

Reaching agreements with government and key stakeholders on clear vulnerability criteria reduces the risks of having inflated child protection caseloads, which in turn allows for higher quality case management processes until case closure. 

Programme integration, integrating the provision of psychosocial support with the education sector, ensures greater number of children benefit from both education and protection services and activities, and maximizes on use of available structures.  In addition, collaboration with WASH ensures all child-friendly spaces meet the minimum standards for WASH.  Moreover, integrating birth registration services with health facilities, immunization and nutrition services increases the number of children registered. 
 
KRC8 Ending Open Defecation
Securing highest-level political commitment to the “Clean Nigeria” campaign catalyzed sub-national movement towards ending open defecation leading to key sub-national actions such as development of state-wide ODF roadmaps and launching state campaigns to end open defecation.
By aligning the ODF Campaign with the institutional mandates, some states called for a State of Emergency for WASH, while other states were able to increase investments in WASH.  The engagement of private sector in an organized manner to support “Clean Nigeria” campaign and the development and sustainability of WASH sector has the potential to infuse hugely needed, yet untapped financial/ human resources and boosting possibilities of Nigeria meeting its SDG6 commitment.
Engaging with key stakeholders and policy makers throughout the NORM process ensured a smooth buy-in and ownership of the results as well as the utilization of the data.  The in-depth analysis and wide dissemination of NORM data has helped stakeholders to view the sector from different perspectives, especially with regards to the quality and sustainability of the different WASH services. In addition, strengthening the engagement with media houses and private sector has been an effective way of improving awareness of sanitation issues amongst policy makers and capable of creating mass movement to support the ‘Clean Nigeria: Use the Toilet’ Campaign.
 
Change strategies
Based on the new monitoring framework, a programme performance monitoring tool was developed using an online Excel for tracking performance at National and States levels.
Improvement in organizing advocacy visits to media owners strengthened partnership and leveraged more air time and space for children. Again, extended partnerships with the entertainment industry helped in elevating child rights advocacy especially using the CRC@30 commemoration platform. UNICEF engaged Nigerian artists to provide a dedicated song and music video to commemorate CRC@30.
Participatory consultative planning, monitoring and evaluation involving relevant stakeholders maximize the sense of ownership, increase the mutual accountability to the achievement of results, ensure the alignment of interventions with the national development strategies and donor thematic focus and priorities, and accelerate the achievement of the intended results to the target children and women.

WCAR,Republic of Cameroon,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Humanitarian response.
Despite its lower middle-income status, Cameroon remains challenged in the context of Disaster Risks Reduction and emergency response—evidenced in the 2019 experience of floods, cholera, landslide and armed conflict.  Pre-positioned stocks and strong leadership role at clusters levels have been critical for humanitarian response. 
Although the humanitarian-development nexus remained a central tenet to joint programming, the government response was hindered by poor coordination between administrative structures and regional delegations of line ministries notably health, WASH, social affairs and education. This highlights the importance of putting in place an effective preparedness including systems strengthening for early action. 
Outbreaks management was typically reactive and proved to be inhibited by insufficient funding and other managerial and coordination issues. It is urgent to mainstream the child dimension to this persistent public health risk and development impediment. Moreover, the understanding of humanitarian principles is inconsistent especially in the context of armed conflict prevailing in the Far North and North-West and South-West regions.
In the NW/SW conflict, acceptance and access were the key challenges. This highlighted the need to combine strong security risk management with sustained community engagement for acceptance by both implementing partners and increasingly, UNICEF staff into hard-to-reach areas.   Externally, considerable weaknesses were identified with local implementing partners in financial and technical management of the packages proposed for the response.
Acceleration of KRC. Achieving meaningful progress is KRC priority areas face multiple challenges notably funding, community engagement, Government commitment and evidence-based decision making. To remove these bottlenecks, the Country Programme implemented the following solutions: broadening alliances with key players, faith-based platforms, parliamentary network dedicated to nutrition, platform of mayors at regional level and private sector. A total of 24 mayors allocated 1% of Council’s budget to nutrition. In immunization, strong joint advocacy with WHO and technical support have contributed to maintain/revamp immunization response.  Development of a pilot project has enabled to accelerate birth registration in two health districts and allowed to enhance birth registration rate across the respective regions. The worth of interoperability was demonstrated and facilitated the development of an MoU between the Ministries in charge of Health and local development. Tools developed with UNICEF’s support have been adopted and are being used by other development partners notably GiZ. Rapid-pro SMS-based births notification has proven to be effective. PROCIVIS has expressed interest to adopt and use it.
The Programme Theory of Change was developed in 2017. Since then, the programmatic environment has changed significantly with the growing demand for humanitarian response. The results framework adopted in 2017 focuses on quality of services, demand and the enabling environment. To address Country Programme capacity to serve children impacted by emergencies, the humanitarian – development nexus was adopted. This nexus was deemed to serve the purpose of two ways capitalization on emergency funds, strategies and intervention to reinforce systems’ and community’s resilience to external shocks.
To optimize emergency response in conflict affected zones, the Country Office has reshaped it human resources and extended its field presence to Buea (South-West Region) and Bamenda (North-West Region).
The UNDAF mid-term review adopted emerging thematic areas (youths and adolescents – Urbanization – Climate changes). Mindful of difficulties faced to mobilize resources, UN Agencies have opted to reinforce the humanitarian – development – peace nexus as a common approach to effective Delivery as One (DaO) in emergences affected zones.
Likewise, linked to the decision by National Government to accelerate the pace in decentralization implementation, collaboration with local councils will be reinforced through the Council’s Development Plans platform.
The 2019 mid-term review adopted priority shifts to reinforce Country Programme relevance to its programmatic environment.  The major strategies proposed to underpin the new challenges are:
·       Reinforce mainstreaming of humanitarian – development – peace strategy in Programme operation at all levels;
·       Reinforce address sociocultural bottlenecks that hamper demand and use of basic social services for children, adolescents and mothers to increase effective coverage of high-impact intervention on the wellbeing of the child;
·       Partner with local councils to create and shared accountability framework with all stakeholders at community and grassroots levels;
·       Operationalize business for results in favor of children through partnerships with domestic business and private sector;
·       Implement innovative approaches to solve child rights issues and feed strategic level advocacy;
Partner with youths and adolescents as agents of change. Country Programme will provide them with opportunities to support children’s mandate and to contribute to their own professional development.

Decentralization. The law on decentralization reinforces the role of Local Councils in management of development affairs at grassroots level. Decision to allocate 15% of the national budget to local council is also an opportunity to leverage resources for children in social sectors. Advocacy will be continued to engage additional local councils in the support implementation of child sensitive Council Development Plans. This will also serve to push the establishment of a shared accountability framework which will reinforce citizens’ participation, accountability and contribution to local development. The special status granted to North-West and South-West regions by the law on decentralization will also be optimized by Country Programme to contribute to the reopening of basic social services delivery units as conditions of security and stability are re-established.
Urbanization. More than 60% of Cameroonian population are living in urban areas with inadequate basic social services facilities. Children from the poorest families are facing difficulties to access quality services with limited purchasing power. Most of these children’s education and health conditions are like those dwelling in rural areas. Additionally, spillover effects of the NW/SW crisis have contributed to the increase of (displaced) populations in major cities notably in the Littoral, Centre and West regions. Cases of children abuse and gender-based violence are also on the rise. Working for children in urban areas is also an emerging priority for the Country Programme also taking into consideration the positive results achieved in Yaoundé 2 with the setting up of a model urban intersectoral child protection system."
WCAR,Sao Tome & Principe,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"While a formal MTR was not organized, the country office had several opportunities to take stock of three years of implementation of the CPD, identify lessons learnt and test the theory of change to inform programme implementation. With regards to cross-sectoriality, the country office identified in the CLTS approach an ideal platform for integration of other sectors and services. The office increased joint field visits in CLTS communities and realized that multiple deprivations and vulnerabilities affect community engagement to end open defecation. As a result, the team designed a package of interventions which could allow UNICEF and its partners to respond to needs of vulnerable children and their families across health, education and protection sectors.
 In collaboration and with the support of the Regional Office, UNICEF Office in Sao Tome and Principe successfully concluded two important evaluations: the evaluation of the cold chain and the evaluation of the parental education programme (PEP). Both evaluations relate directly to the KRCs and allow the country office and partners to reflect on sustainability of UNICEF support, equitable access to services and effective ownership by national counterparts.  Specifically, with regards to the country office contribution to KRC1, the cold chain evaluation as well as the stable positive trends in vaccination coverage, confirm UNICEF added value within the wider health system.  The evaluation results are being used to draw attention to the existing bottlenecks to universalization of vaccination and at the same alert government on the risks related to transition to vaccine independence, if adequate measures are not taken in time.
The important surge in malaria cases at the beginning of 2019 showed that without continuous support and adequate budget provision, important milestones achieved by the country in meeting the MDGs can be lost. The emergency situation led to improve coordination between WHO and UNICEF which joined forces to conduct a mid-term review of the malaria plan. The risk profile presented by UNISDR is calling for the UN system to step up its support to the government for the development of a national contingency plan. While the profile is not child sensitive, UNICEF will have to be ready to support the exercise to make sure the plan takes into account children and young people needs.
 The Country Office contribution to KRC3 has been characterized by the institutional and strategic support for the integration of key interventions to reduce the rate of out of school children in the new Education Policy Chart and its Action Plan. UNICEF used the results of the OOSC study completed in 2018 to leverage support by other critical stakeholders. As a result, the World Bank committed funds to improve retention in secondary education and boost quality education which are considered the main bottleneck for the reduction of the number of out of school children.
Despite the limited resources available, UNICEF in STP was able to effectively use the knowledge generated to influence investments and leverage attention on important areas such as girl’s education and life skills.
 Through the use of the BELDS (Better Early Learning Development System) methodology to strengthen preprimary education planning, the country office showcased the importance of an in-depth analysis of education subsectors in lieu of a general planning exercise which often maintains the status quo of the education system functioning mechanisms.
With regards to KRC5, the office continues to struggle with data monitoring. The efforts done in collaboration with UNFPA and UNDP to strengthen criminal statistics and case monitoring at are not yet productive. Following consultation with both the regional office and HQ, the Country Office decided to wait for MICS6 results expected in mid-2020 to conduct a secondary analysis of violence data and possibly a comprehensive VAC study. Nevertheless, the Country Office equipped the child protection section with additional HR resources to support internal data collection and analysis on violence by tapping into existing data sources (police, health centers, counselling centers) while institutional capacities on data case management are further strengthened. As highlighted by programme monitoring as well as by both evaluations mentioned above, behavior change strategies needs to be further refined and informed by evidence.
 Consultative processes with children, young people and associations are being accelerated through UNICEF support at both national and district level. The dynamization and empowerment of the child parliament, created with UNICEF support in 2017, proved that through close monitoring and support, the parliament can truly become a forum for youth empowerment and foster co-creation of child friendly solutions to societal problems. 
 With regards to innovation and especially T4D, the Country Office was able to gain the government support for strategies such as Internet of Good Things and Ureport. Unfortunately, despite efforts to attract private and national communication companies to support those strategies, conditions are not yet there to move forward. The arrival of an ICT officer in charge of T4D in the team is expected to help UNICEF to identify additional opportunities for the use of T4D to advance children’s agenda.
Because of UNICEF’s voice in the country and its role in advocacy for children's rights, the Agency receives to ad hoc requests by National Counterparts such as support to events and campaigns which are often unplanned or for which clear objectives are not identified upfront.  This situation can be explained by the need of the new government to show quick results and concrete actions to the nation.
Looking forward, it will be important for UNICEF, in collaboration with other UN Agencies, to further support strategic vision and planning across all sectors and help the new government and partners to focus on game -changing strategies.  From an internal planning and monitoring perspective, in 2019 UNICEF started to be confronted to the limits of the current theory of change, especially as rapid urbanization, climate change and an increasingly young population impact profiles of vulnerable children and their families.
As the country office enters the last two years of its CPD implementation and starts preparing the new country programme, it will need to further invest in knowledge generation especially in WASH, Child Protection and social Protection areas. A gender programmatic review will be conducted in 2020 and most of all MICS6 results will be finally released. Indeed, MICS6 data represent an extraordinary opportunity not only to adjust ongoing programming by UNICEF and its partners but also to inform progresses towards SDGs in the framework of UNDAF as all the UN agencies engage in the decade of action. In line with Strategic Plan MTR, the Country Office will need to clearly identify its role and contribution to reduce the impact of climate change and environmental degradation on children and social services. Finally, the increased presence and involvement of private sector from the tourism, oil and cocoa/coffee business areas is an opportunity to expand partnership for children in Sao Tome and Principe. The modus operandi of business sector, demands that UNICEF be aware their interests, entertain regular dialogue and ultimately engage with private companies to support child friendly financing and promote sustainable development for younger generations.

WCAR,Senegal,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The Salmaitou’ public-private partnership was launched to offer highly disadvantaged girls an opportunity to acquire digital; entrepreneurial; science, technology, engineering and mathematics; and life skills. The UNICEF-led initiative involves several start-ups, the Virtual University of Senegal and partners with the Chloe Foundation (France) and Rovio Entertainment Group (Finland). Through their participation in boot-camps, 10-18 years old girls were able to develop self-confidence, learn transferrable skills and competencies and gain access to professional opportunities. The approach targeted out-of-school adolescent girls from marginalized municipalities in Kolda Region. Based on the 2019 pilot, the initiative will expend in 2020. The ‘Salmaitou’ project exemplifies the importance of unleashing girls’ potential to become achievers in traditionally male-dominated sectors and to bridge the digital gap between boys and girls.
UNICEF was involved in establishing the ‘Youth Consortium’ in Senegal – the first network of youth-led organizations addressing young peoples’ access education, employment and empowerment opportunities. The Consortium includes more than 20 youth networks and partners with the Ministry of Youth, key public and private sector entities and others (UN agencies, EU etc.). Based on the Generation Unlimited approach and framework of action, the Consortium offers a unique platform for working for and with young people in Senegal. It will be formally launched in 2020 and will focus on impactful large-scale initiatives.
In the framework of CRC@30 celebrations, UNICEF initiated an innovative partnership with the MoE to teach the ‘World Largest Lesson’ to all pupils enrolled in upper-primary schools throughout the country, with a special focus on child rights and the right to education. Some 370,000 pupils were mobilized, triggering the development of local solutions for enrolling out-of-school children.
Pneumonia is the leading cause of death from infectious disease for Senegalese children aged 1–5 years. The Scaling-Up Pneumonia Response (SPRINT) initiative was launched in Senegal as part of an improved package of interventions for frontline health facilities: a combination of oxygen and amoxicillin dispersible tablets is available for the first time at health posts and a pulse oximeter used to monitor hypoxia.  Lifesaving pneumonia treatment will be an entry point for empowering people and communities, integrated health services and multi-sectoral policy and action; private sector partnerships will be sought for scale-up. UNICEF supported the development of a national plan for SPRINT in 2019, aiming to benefit close to 100,000 children with this life-saving intervention in 2020.
Child protection relies on a chain of responsibilities across sectors, including prevention, detection, care and rehabilitation. The system’s efficiency depends on each sector’s contribution, but other sectors rarely consider CP as part of their mandate. In Senegal, UNICEF promoted bilateral dialogue with each sectors, particularly health and education, to promote understanding of the importance of violence and harmful practices to their own agenda and how to mainstream CP into their policies and services. Thus UNICEF devoted special attention to support the ministry in charge of CP to coordinate a multi-sectoral reflection process and point to specific opportunities for integrating CP. This resulted in new national guidelines clarifying sectors’ CP responsibilities, as well as the integration of CP into health and education policies, procedures and routine monitoring.
In targeted regions UNICEF promoted inter-operability between health and civil registry services at the operational level to accelerate birth registration, following the completion in 2019 of two UNICEF-supported studies demonstrating the crucial impact of health services on BR. Children born in health facilities with BR support desks are twice as likely to be registered as children born in other health facilities, and their parents are seven times more likely to register their child than others and twice as likely to receive their child’s birth certificate. An evaluation of UNICEF Senegal’s contribution to the project linking BR to health facilities, supported by Canada, showed the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability of this collaborative model. Investments in scaling up this approach will continue in 2020.
With support from UNICEF and in close consultation with other ministries and civil society, the Ministry of Family, Women, Gender and Child Protection adopted, for the first time in Senegal, national handbooks for social dialogue with communities, parents and adolescents/children on child protection, with a special focus on VAC and child marriage. Child participation and gender equality concepts incorporated in this work contributed to building a child-friendly culture and listening to girls’/women’s voices. Further roll-out of the approach will continue in 2020.
Throughout 2019, the UNICEF operations team focused on increasing and expanding its customer orientation in the delivery of services to the organization and partners. An Intranet platform was launched in 2019, providing easy access to internal work processes, tools and forms for interacting with operations. Training on the Table of Authority, role of committees and the harmonized approach to cash transfers was held to reinforce staff capacity. An internal survey was undertaken to measure satisfaction with operations services, yielding an overall rating of (4.1/5), an increase over 2018 (3.7/5).
Establishing new alliances with leading national institutions is critical to UNICEF’s efforts for children in Senegal. The Social, Economic and Environment Council (CESE) is a national government body accountable for matters of national interest and initiating societal dialogue, as well as formulating recommendations to the National Assembly to be considered by the executive branch, which is obliged by law to respond to CESE. Defining the scope of the strategic partnership with CESE initiated in 2019 will be prioritized in early 2020. Another new alliance for UNICEF was with the national committee of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, a multi-stakeholder platform that seeks to place children at the heart of discussions about the distribution of state revenues from the extractive industry, given the recent discovery of gas and oil in Senegal. This strategic partnership will enable UNICEF to deepen its outreach and influence on decision-making processes that impact children’s lives and determine social sector investments.
"
WCAR,Sierra Leone,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Constraints
Coordinating health and nutrition supply chains continued to be complex in 2019. Unpredictable funding and a fragmented supply chain system led to delays of Free Health Care (FHC) commodity distribution, and stock outs of nutrition therapeutic supplies at facility levels. Similarly, while UNICEF has been supporting the integration of routine distribution of the Global Fund funded HIV, TB and malaria commodities, due to different procurement processes across partner organisations, coupled with storage, transportation and human resource constraints, difficultly was faced in managing distribution timelines across the three programme supply chains. As a result, the HIV programme missed several of the integrated distribution rounds and stockouts were reported at district and facility levels.
Lessons in Supply and Distribution 
The supply constraints provided UNICEF with two important lessons: first, all four elements of supply chain management (integration, operations, purchasing and distribution) are interdependent, thus planning cannot be done in isolation. Second, a harmonized approach facilitated by real time communication and data visibility to coordinate parties across the supply network is critical.
Given the wide range of products required for the FHC initiative, procurement planning to ensure timely arrival of medicines was central. Procurement requests from Government were rounded off to full container loads, procurement lead times per product category were determined and procurement deadlines were communicated with partners and donors. This approach allowed UNICEF to plan for arrival of FHC items up to March 2021.
Previous end-user monitoring showed an accumulation of education supplies at district level since no formal supply chain mechanism existed. Long term storage in temporary facilities increased the risk of loss and damage. In 2019 the supply strategy was adjusted for direct delivery to schools in the form of kits. Collaborative picking and packing with authorities in districts with appropriate space for distribution monitoring, increased both the understanding of what was supplied, speed of distribution, and ownership of products.
UNICEF implemented the innovative mWIMS application to address warehouse and inventory management challenges. Through the application, combined with re-aligning warehouse management processes, the end of year stock count had a $0.45 USD discrepancy compared to a 2018 discrepancy of $94,511 USD. The time spent on physical inventory counts was reduced from 2–4 days to less than half a day, a significant saving of resources. The lessons in how these processes were made more efficient through innovative application of technology will continue to be applied during the next Country Programme.
Necessity of cross sector integration to accelerate KRCs
A constraint in addressing KRC6 has been parallel Programme Cooperation Agreements (PCAs) developed with education and child protection civil society partners. A key strategic shift in 2019 was to align the results of the PCAs towards common objectives of preventing child marriage by getting girls back to school. By working in a more integrated and collaborative manner in addressing child protection issues through schools, as well as life skills building in non-formal spaces, UNICEF was able to track results more clearly, exceed targets, and deliver programmes for children more efficiently.
Prior to 2019 KRC3 was addressed primarily through re-enrolment of children who had dropped out. In 2019 the education programme focused on addressing the systemic causes of KRC3, through linking the KRC4 objectives of enhanced quality ECD programming and increasing pre-school and right age enrolment. Ensuring that children are school-ready and have had access to quality pre-primary education addresses both the symptoms and the causes of dropping out. It does so through increasing quality to reduce attrition rates, increasing retention through school readiness, and re-enrolling children who have dropped out. The MBSSE will continue to apply this lesson in 2020, having included pre-primary education as a key priority in the FQSE programme.
A major achievement in Sierra Leone’s KRC7 target to develop an interoperable birth registration process with the health sector is the development of effective working arrangements between institutions. Following a 14-month transition period, the NCRA is now functional and operational at the national and district level. A Memorandum of Understanding is in place between the MoHS and NCRA to facilitate cooperation on the development of an interoperable registration system, with plans to build e-birth notification system. This cross sectoral integration to increase the number of children who have their births registered in Sierra Leone will be further strengthened going into the next Country Programme.
Scaling up evidence-informed programming 
The lack of high quality, disaggregated data has been a challenge for the Country Office during this programme cycle. The Country Office has been addressing gaps and shortcomings identified during the development of the new Country Programme. While developing the new theories of change for the 2020-2023 Country Programme there was a need for fiscal and budgetary analyses in the social sectors, as well as limited use of systematic operational research methodologies for pilots/models to support the scaling up of programmes.
Use of quality evidence to design and monitor programmes is critical to the new Country Programme, and in preparation the Child Protection programme is undertaking surveys on social and behavioural drivers for child marriage, the results of which will then guide the development of social norms programmes to reduce child marriage. Formative research on violence against children in homes has been conducted and will inform the development of a parenting education programme in Sierra Leone; and an ethnographic study on FGM is also underway which will inform UNICEF’s interventions on this topic, which will include working with the Government to finalize a National Strategy for the Reduction of FGM.
Further opportunities to achieve results through innovative evidence-based programming became apparent after the successful advocacy for heightened political commitment toward strengthening PHC and institutionalizing community health. With application of technology UNICEF supported geospatial data analysis and visualisations of health facility and CHW distribution, identifying gaps with respect to deprivations and access to services. The results were both presented in a World Bank workshop and used in a briefing note shared with the high level joint UN-donor CHW mission convened by the President. The mission synthesized all available evidence and brought stakeholders together to co-create the common vision toward consolidation, integration and institutionalization of the CHW programme for improved quality, efficiency and financial sustainability.
Resource mobilisation 
In 2019 the Country Office galvanized fundraising with non-traditional donors to expand its avenue of resource mobilisation through its core donors only. This laid the groundwork for new funding partnerships to develop in 2020. Sierra Leone was featured in prominent appeal ceremonies by the UK Natcom, raising £7.9 million for immunization programmes for children globally, including in Sierra Leone. Following a visit by the Foreign Minister of Iceland hosted by the country office, WASH and Livelihoods commitments from the Government of Iceland nearly doubled. Further, based on targeted outreach, Finland presented a commitment to fund ECD and Child Protection specific to reduction of harmful cultural practices. Lessons from a successful approach to diversifying the country office donor base will be carried into 2020 and applied to integrated programming.
The Sierra Leone Country Office will take these lessons forward going into 2020, and ensure that through the application of results based management approaches, effective fundraising, and the use of evidence, the office delivers high quality, scalable and accountable programming to sustainably improve the position of children in Sierra Leone.

WCAR,Togo,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Partie 3 : Leçons apprises et innovations
Suite aux investissements sur la période 2012-2018 dans la diffusion des émissions de radios communautaires sur les Pratiques Familiales Essentielles, le Gouvernement et l’UNICEF ont commandité en 2018 une évaluation pour permettre aux parties prenantes de tirer les leçons du partenariat avec les radios communautaires afin d’améliorer leurs pratiques dans ce domaine.
Cette évaluation avait deux buts : la redevabilité et l’apprentissage organisationnel. L’évaluation a analysé l’exigence de rendre compte aux planificateurs et aux bailleurs (redevabilité verticale) et aux communautés ciblées (redevabilité horizontale) sur les effets de ces partenariats.
Quant à l’apprentissage, l’évaluation a généré des preuves sur la performance et les résultats de la mise en œuvre de ce partenariat, qui ont servi à la programmation 2019-2020 des radios communautaires, au renforcement de la coordination au niveau national et régional dans la gestion des radios communautaires et à l’élargissement du partenariat avec les radios.
Constats et Conclusions Clés
Sur la période 2012-2018, approximativement 1.890 émissions radiophoniques ont été produites en lien avec les résultats du Programme de Coopération sur la Santé, l’Eau-Hygiène-Assainissement, l’Education et la Protection. Ces émissions visaient à faire de la radio un véhicule de transformation au sein des communautés.
Théorie du changement : Les auditeurs connaissaient les principaux messages sanitaires et éducatifs ; ceci ne se traduisait pas pour autant dans un changement des pratiques. Face aux contraintes financières et géographiques et aux conditions d’accueil à la maternité, il était difficile de convaincre une femme enceinte d’aller accoucher dans une structure de santé. Il n’existe pas une relation automatique entre la promotion d’un comportement, la connaissance de ce comportement et son application.
Pertinence : elle est jugée moyenne. La radio demeure un média apprécié doté d’une certaine crédibilité auprès de ses auditeurs. L’évaluation a montré que certains groupes sociaux (caractérisés par l’âge, le genre, l’appartenance ethnique ou religieuse, l’activité économique, la profession…) utilisent peu la radio.
Les thématiques suivantes font débat au sein de la société : l’excision au Nord, l’infanticide dans le cas d’enfant soupçonnés de sorcellerie (plutôt en Région Centrale), le mariage précoce, les pratiques médicales endogènes dangereuses pour les enfants et la contraception. Vis-à-vis de ces thématiques, une approche radiophonique est inefficace car les oppositions ne sont pas dues à un manque d’information. Dans ce contexte, la radio joue parfois un rôle positif lorsqu’elle met en place les conditions d’un dialogue apaisé.
Le suivi des Plans Médias des radios a posé plus de difficultés dans le cas des radios excentrées. Le suivi a été généralement pris en charge par la Direction Régionale du Plan et les points focaux santé, éducation, action sociale, eau-hygiène-assainissement du niveau préfectoral. La communication entre le niveau préfectoral et le niveau régional n’a pas toujours été optimale.
Efficacité : les partenariats avec les radios semblent avoir atteint leurs objectifs. Les radios ont permis d’atteindre certaines des populations éloignées, d’organiser le dialogue autour de problématiques sensibles et d’accentuer le souhait de faire « comme les autres » grâce aux rôles modèles vis-à-vis de certaines pratiques favorables. Il y a une nécessité de programmer les émissions « aux heures de grande écoute ».
Efficience : La plupart des 21 radios partenaires n’ont pas d’entrées financières suffisantes. Leur survie financière dépend des contrats avec les églises, les ONG, les guérisseurs, les mouvements politiques ou les annonceurs. Dans les zones urbaines, la concurrence entre acteurs ne permet pas toujours de placer les émissions sur les pratiques familiales essentielles aux heures de grande écoute. Dans les zones rurales, l’insertion dans les grilles est souvent plus aisée.
Durabilité : La pérennisation demeure un défi du fait du faible financement des émissions sur les pratiques familiales essentielles.
Genre et Droits Humains : Les contenus de ces émissions ne contribuent pas à une habilitation des auditeurs avec un mode injonctif « voilà ce que vous devez faire » ; « voilà ce qui est souhaitable pour vous et pour l’enfant » - voire normatif - « voilà quel est le bon comportement ».
La représentativité des femmes dans les radios et les services étatiques, en particulier au niveau décisionnel, est faible au niveau régional.
Appropriation : Les radios se sont appropriées superficiellement la nécessité d’impliquer les groupes cibles les plus défavorisés ou marginalisés.
Couverture : La couverture territoriale des radios partenaires est parfois surestimée. Plusieurs Préfectures et/ou localités ne sont pas couvertes.
Cohérence : Les activités des radios communautaires s’inscrivent parfaitement dans les efforts de communication visant à promouvoir des changements sociaux et comportementaux bénéfiques aux enfants et à leurs familles. Il a été constaté une faible articulation entre les émissions radios et les différentes activités soutenues par le programme, en particulier celles du renforcement des systèmes de santé et d’éducation, de santé communautaire, de promotion des droits humains et d’hygiène et assainissement.
Le Bureau a appuyé le Gouvernement dans le renforcement des capacités et l’élaboration d’une Stratégie C4D 2019-2023 de manière participative. Elle prend en compte les recommandations stratégiques suivantes :

Cibler davantage les groupes les plus marginalisés qui ont le plus besoin d’information sur la santé, l’éducation et les droits humains.
Renforcer l’intersectorialité et la transversalité liant la C4D et les programmes sociaux du Gouvernement.
Promouvoir la participation des auditeurs aux émissions via des débats.
Prévoir une évaluation de la qualité et de l’effet des radios.
Cette stratégie comprend une théorie de changement et un cadre de résultat standardisé et intersectoriel, avec des indicateurs mesurables et un budget. Il permet aussi de dégager les gaps financiers en vue de la mobilisation des fonds. 
Les leçons apprises ont été prises en compte au cours de la revue annuelle. La programmation C4D des plans de travail de 2020 intègre le partenariat avec les radios communautaires.
