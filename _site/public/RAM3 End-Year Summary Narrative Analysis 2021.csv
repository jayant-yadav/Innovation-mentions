EAPR,Cambodia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Health and Nutrition responses: Cambodia introduced COVID-19 vaccines with UNICEF support as a critical partner alongside WHO and became one of the most vaccinated countries in the world. UNICEF provided substantial support to promote risk communication and community engagement, cold chain strengthening, contingency planning, local coordination and community mobilization to reach vulnerable populations. 
 
Strong government leadership at the highest level, with inter-ministerial coordination structures established across the country, facilitated resources and ensured common priorities. These coordination mechanisms can be leveraged to move beyond COVID-19 specific interventions and become part of COVID-19 recovery programming, and be of use to promote equitable social services for women and children.
 
Given global supply constraints, the government pursued diverse procurement channels, not only relying on COVAX but also securing bilateral donations and procurement of vaccines. UNICEF’s continued support in strengthening the entire country’s vaccine management and cold chain systems, both routine and COVID-19 vaccines, ensured the government was able to utilize vaccines effectively. 
 
Strong COVID-19 risk communication and community engagement efforts, supported by UNICEF and WHO, contributed to maintaining relatively low vaccine hesitancy among targeted populations. The social listening and monitoring platforms developed can be broadened to promote and capture population perspectives on wider issues affecting children.
 
UNICEF leveraged its existing partnerships and programmes with ministries and partners in the sectors of Education, Social Protection, Child Protection and Communications to ensure timely information and vaccination for specific groups, such as teachers, people with disabilities, ethnic minorities, ID poor, pregnant and lactating women, and people in street situations. This was an innovative multi-sectoral approach that led to LTAs with private sector suppliers and dedicated T4D and C4D resources for the office, which will have long-term benefits in broader programming for children beyond COVID-19. 
 
Child Protection focus on systems and data:
An innovative approach accelerated progress on social service workforce strengthening, with UNICEF playing a critical convening and technical role to engage MoI and MoSVY towards enhancing the policy and normative framework for the social service workforce. Securing high-level government leadership was a key driving force for the formal appointment of 204 district government staff as social service workers, and for the adoption of the first-ever job description for social workers. The workforce was strengthened through the adoption of a training strategy, a training curriculum and modules, and the finalization of the National Strategic Plan and Code of Ethics. Key cross-sectoral areas such as early childhood development, disability and gender-based violence were also integrated in the training curriculum and modules for the social service workforce. In view of the role Cambodia will play as incoming ASEAN chair in 2022, preparations have been made to champion the establishment and strengthening of the social service workforce initiative, and exchange lessons learned across the region, particularly with a focus to strengthen the link between social work and social protection.
 
Shock Responsive Social Protection: 
UNICEF provided significant support to the government to build a delivery system for routine cash transfer programmes. The system was used to design and build the COVID-19 Cash Transfer Programme, implemented since June 2020. In 2021, with the emergence of community transmission particularly affecting urban areas, UNICEF supported the government to design and deliver the one-off Lockdown Cash Transfer Programme for Phnom Penh, Takeo and Sihanoukville. Building on existing systems, the innovative targeting mechanism looking into near poor households engaged in vulnerable professions ( eg –street vendors) using a combination of vulnerability and poverty indicators, in collaboration with GIZ and UNDP. The programme, delivered in June and July 2021, reached over 108,000 households and provided valuable lessons on developing targeting tools for the near-poor and to deliver cash transfer programmes in urban contexts. This included community engagement and communication, access to diverse payment modalities and reaching out to mobile and un-registered populations in urban settings. With the emergence of the Shock-Responsive Social Protection Framework for Cambodia, the lessons learned from programme delivery will contribute to the design of long-term approaches to national emergency responses.
 
Generation Future:
UNICEF launched the pilot Generation Future (GF) offering mentorship, skills training and seed funding to youth with ideas to create positive change in their communities. In less than three months, the first cohort of mentees launched  projects and campaigns tackling challenges they were concerned about such as mental health, climate change, education and inequality. Thereafter, thirteen candidates were chosen as  potential change makers. Additionally, social media campaigns and community clean-up projects were launched along with mental health awareness videos that attracted over 100,000 views.  A climate change anthem was also released with a viral social media challenge and 30 volunteers were mobilized to support one of the projects. Complementing on this, the GF Facebook support group gained 800 youth members willing to support and  be engaged in the initiative.
 
While a full evaluation of GF is underway, some key lessons included that cross-cutting collaboration with clear roles and responsibilities is essential for the future viability of the programme. Currently, GF is managed by the Communications team, which does not have expertise in long-term strategic youth development. As a result, there were inefficiencies in designing and implementing GF and the programme was unable to fully leverage established youth partnerships. 
 
UNICEF Cambodia is moving towards maximizing and scaling up the GF transforming it into a cross-cutting initiative under the ADAP umbrella that will bring together expertise from Communication, Education and Child Protection teams, alongside the private sector engagement specialist. This will enable the project to support a larger and more diverse group of youth.
 
To improve impact and sustainability, collaboration across sectors will  be established ahead of time, ensuring that a larger pool of potential mentors is identified, and mentorship is provided for at least for six months.
"
EAPR,China,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"1)     Effective ways of scaling up 
 
The new programme cycle aims to move away from small-scale pilots that do not go beyond service delivery. More emphasis is being put on the scale up of UNICEF’s service models and packages. Leveraging GoC’s existing service delivery system will increase the chances of success. For example, the ECD package for children under 3 years of age was piloted through GoC’s health system, a comprehensive three-tier medical and health service network that extends from province to township and village level. In collaboration with NHC and MOF, UNICEF is currently scaling up the ECD package by integrating it into the country’s basic public health care package. The planned national scale up of the IYCF counseling training through the national health system and the professional association such as the China Nutrition Society is another example. 
 
UNICEF is also using a bottom-up approach by exploring innovative service delivery models and demonstrating effectiveness. UNICEF piloted the CBFS model and demonstrated its effectiveness in enhancing caregivers’ knowledge and practices in caregiving, which led to the GoC’s decision to replicate the model nationwide. The CBFS model has also been incorporated in ACWF’s strategies to implement the State Council’s Guiding Opinion on promoting care services for children under 3 years of age. 
 
2)     Adaptive approach
 
Engagement with more government counterparts has become increasingly important in a rapidly changing programming context. To maximize efforts for programme implementation and growth, UNICEF took an adaptive approach by expanding partnerships including new departments in the NHC, other ministries such as MOF and MPS, professional associations and private agencies. Due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, it was not possible to organize in-person field missions to SSCAF project countries for government counterparts. CIDCA participated in a UNICEF virtual field trip to Mali, Malawi and Jordan to maintain close engagement. 
 
UNICEF also took an adaptive programming approach amid COVID-19. Experience exchange between MCA and two state governments of India on social assistance registry building was held virtually. Building on the previous year’s efforts to train BFSWs virtually, an automated response mechanism on WeChat was designed to provide BFSWs with technical assistance based on FAQs.
 
Most trainings have also been shifted online, posing challenges to training quality. For instance, a participatory approach for the CBFS training is very important for trainees to grasp the knowledge and skills in responsive caregiving. The effectiveness of virtual training is not comparable to face-to-face training. Therefore, close follow-ups with trainees, interactiveness and on-site supervision are essential.
 
UNICEF has also taken adaptive approaches for training. Instead of a one-size-fits-all, the IYCF project offered different training schedules for health workers at different administrative levels, maximizing the fund usage and training resources. The SSCAF-MNCH training modules were designed as self-paced and requested participants’ feedback to enhance the training relevance and quality. 
 
 
3)     Synergy between UNICEF programmes 
 
UNICEF sought to improve results by seeking synergies from different technical areas. For example, different areas of child development - FFW and Urban Food Environment - were introduced and integrated in the CFC action plans of Changsha and Shenzhen, respectively. This synergy strengthened city-level cross-agency coordination. The integration of the SSC component into UNICEF programming such as MCH not only amplified UNICEF programmes’ impact through knowledge exchange but served as an opportunity for UNICEF to strengthen government counterparts’ institutional and technical capacity in SSC. Through UNICEF’s ECD cross-sectoral group, the integration of the Nurturing Care Framework into sections’ various programmes has been facilitated through regular knowledge exchange.
Country Office is working on office-wide implementation of the PSEA action plan through CSOs assessment, training of staff and participation in the UN Network on PSEA.
 
4)     Value of youth participation and engagement 
 
In 2021, UNICEF engaged with children and adolescents in a series of programming and advocacy activities to uphold children’s rights to participation. UNICEF’s advocacy contributed to the incorporation of Child Participation in CFC. In the adolescent mental health campaign, young people were engaged throughout the design and implementation, including co-creating the theme song and campaign materials, advocating through youth mental health clubs, and organizing a youth-focused panel at the launch event. The engagement of children with disabilities was promoted to raise awareness on disability inclusion through the development of a picture book.  
 
Adolescent participation and youth engagement enriched UNICEF’s understanding, experiences and views on child-related issues and child rights, and allowed UNICEF to develop more effective, relevant and adolescent-friendly content. 
 
Youth engagement takes time and will need sustained commitment. It is essential to explore ways to institutionalize child and youth participation in decision-making of government and communities. UNICEF is also supporting research to explore China’s model of child participation in urban planning.
 
5)     Importance of diverse partnerships
 
UNICEF needs wider and more diverse partnerships to address difficult issues and work effectively in cross-sectoral areas. Experience from the integrated child protection model showed that cross-sectoral collaboration of child protection with social protection, welfare and education for more comprehensive prevention is necessary to change traditional norms on child discipline. Building strategic partnerships with GoC in SSC also requires cross-organizational efforts to build trust both at capital and field/embassy levels with GoC to demonstrate UNICEF’s comparative advantages and added value.
 
The potential of the private sector in advocacy and resource mobilization should not be underestimated given their expertise, innovation, reach and influence. This was particularly true for child online protection and WASH. The internet industry, especially a few leading companies, closely followed and participated in consultations organized by the legislative branch on the newly added child online protection chapter of the revised Law on the Protection of Minors, indicating an important role of the private sector in policymaking and implementation. Additionally, the private sector’s interest in climate and sanitation funding remains high, opening opportunities for resource mobilization. UNICEF has explored innovative approaches, including leveraging the CSR funds of private companies to finance the climate and gender-responsive sanitation project. 

"
EAPR,DP Republic of Korea,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Collective and coordinated advocacy under the leadership of the UN Resident Coordinator, supported by UNICEF and other UN agencies, was vital to resumption of importation of life-saving supplies in cooperation with Government partners. Clear definition of ""life-saving"" supplies, in terms of critical humanitarian need, ensured credibility and trust was maintained with funding partners and facilitated smooth engagement with the UN 1718 Sanctions Committee. 

The complex supply operation led by the UNICEF Country Office relied on creative and agile logistics management, for example by making adjustments to traditional freight processes such as the introduction of temperature-controlled containers to ensure integrity and quality of supplies that could be affected by uncertain timelines for quarantine and disinfection processes, and proactively engaging key players at all stages of the dynamic supply chain from manufacturers to the Government. 

Maintaining close engagement and contact with key resource partners during the year through regular virtual meetings and updates was essential for reaching agreement on extension of duration of key grants to prevent any loss of funding given the constraints on programme implementation and related financial expenditures. In addition, the re-programming of grants in some cases enabled better alignment with new programming realities and emerging needs in the wake of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Such agreements, and work-arounds, required close collaboration with other UNICEF divisions, including the Public Partnerships Division, the Division of Financial and Administrative Management, Supply Division and the Regional Office for East Asia and the Pacific.
 
With the prolonged period of border closures and continuing stockpiling of supplies procured but which could not be delivered before the restrictions came into place, the Country Office designed and introduced a supply tracking and mapping system. This enabled programme managers, supply and logistics staff and senior management to quickly pinpoint locations of supplies, see expiration dates of items with fixed shelf-lives and the duration of funding attached to supplies. This system facilitated prioritisation of shipments, in consultation with Government partners, as and when new importation opportunities might arise. The close monitoring of pipeline supplies and proactive decision-making regarding the timing of raising and closing procurement orders was critical in reducing risks of excessive demurrage fees or loss of funds due to expiration of donor grants.
  
In the absence of international staff field monitoring visits, the focus on remote monitoring was essential in 2021 to maintain an acceptable level of programme assurance, results monitoring and credibility with donors. UNICEF worked closely with respective line Ministries and national authorities to continue implementing the monitoring mechanism for Global Fund related activities as well as new monitoring approaches for water, sanitation, and hygiene projects. The guidance developed, along with checklists, data triangulation modalities and photographic evidence, is an important step from which additional lessons will be learned and further adaptation for use in other sectors will follow.
 
UNICEF initiated a Country Programme Evaluation to generate lessons learned and recommendations. A key lesson from this ongoing process is the need to distinguish between pre- and post-COVID-19 periods, given the impact of COVID-19 prevention measures on programme delivery. Moving forward, it will also be critical to ensure Government involvement and feedback on the evaluation process.
 
With staff located at times on several different continents during the year, senior management placed a strong focus on retaining a sense of connection across the team, including national seconded staff working in Pyongyang. Efforts included maintaining routine all-staff coordination meetings online, retaining a clear schedule for Country Management Team discussions that included national seconded staff and Staff Association representatives, regular individual meetings between senior management and key programme and operations staff, establishing informal weekly online ""check-in"" meetings for international staff located in diverse countries, conducting remote team retreats for all staff along with team building activities and relevant training opportunities using online platforms. The fragmented nature of the UNICEF Country Office for much of the year underlined the importance of investment in strong information technology and connectivity capacity and solid business continuity planning.

Another step towards regaining some regular working practices, in an environment that remained far from routine, was the launch of a Knowledge Management initiative. This was led by one of the multi-country technical support staff based in China, and is designed to assess and respond to information, knowledge and skills gaps at all levels within the Country Office. The initiative will then identify ways in which gaps can be addressed, despite the physical separation between international and national seconded staff - for example through improved document management systems, capturing of best practices, group information briefings, or specialised online skills-building sessions. After an initial needs audit undertaken in 2021, a new Knowledge Management strategy will be developed in 2022.

The organization's flexible working arrangements were fully utilised to accommodate  the health and well-being of staff members faced with the uncertainties created by the COVID-19 pandemic, including changing international travel restrictions and regulations, pressure on work-life balance created by school closures and disconnection from family members living away from the staff members' place of work. Towards the end of the year, the Country Office emphasised the need to bring all international personnel to the official outpost location of Bangkok, Thailand, to strengthen direct contact between team members and to maximise access to technical expertise available in the Regional Office in the same location. Flexibility was maintained, however, to take into account specific individual needs of some staff for whom such a move would create other challenges. 
 
The two-year rotation cycle for international staff in the Country Office presents threats to continuity and retention of institutional knowledge, given the fast turn-over of personnel, and the potential for gaps in management as recruitment processes take place. To mitigate this, the Country Office engaged in offering stretch assignments for some key positions, supported by comprehensive handover periods with outgoing staff, to ensure continuity of leadership and avoid workloads being transferred to other existing staff members.  
"
EAPR,"EAPRO, Thailand",Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The Regional Office Process Evaluation conducted in 2021 has highlighted key findings as follows: 

EAPRO is well-positioned to provide necessary support to CO but needs to focus on addressing sensitive, high impact and underlying issues at the country level, where less capacity or political will exists.  
COs will benefit from a holistic approach by EAPRO, as opposed to short-term and siloed approach to ensure synergies and complementarities in regional support to countries.  
A more ambitious, utilization-focused, and forward-looking research agenda by EAPRO would help position UNICEF strongly as a knowledge leader for children in the region. Knowledge management could also be more holistic and aligned with CO needs.  
EAPRO’s CO support request platform could be better utilized to prioritize and measure contribution of RO to the achievement of CO results.  
Resources dedicated to C4D in an emergency context could be further strengthened, as evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic.  
The findings and recommendations emerging from the evaluation have been incorporated into the operationalization of the ROMP and captured in the 2022 Annual Management Plan of the RO.  
 
As COVID-19 related travel restrictions continued in 2021, providing RO guidance and technical support for CPD development and reviews proved to be effective through virtual support, which enabled better coordination, integration and participation of regional teams in the process, while having efficiency gains. Consultation with COs confirmed that targeted, coordinated and prioritised in-country support are still needed, with key RO staff providing in-country support for gaining better insight, dialogue with CO and national counterparts, and capacity building. 
 
UNICEF’s participation in the peer support group mechanism and regional collaboration platform, while high in transaction cost, proved to be beneficial in ensuring good communication and coordination with DCO and other agencies, nurturing a transparent and constructive dialogue to support country processes, and also supporting and guiding RCOs, UNCTs and COs in aligning the cooperation framework and CPDs.  
 
For COVID-19 response, collaboration was strengthened with WHO WPRO, SEARO and UNICEF ROSA for the preparation of COVID-19 vaccine rollout through streamlined communication and alignment of guidance provided to the countries. While there were challenges around the different approaches taken by the different ROs, the collaboration allowed for good practices from one region to be transferred to another WHO region. The establishment of a cross-EAPRO group on immunization has also led to better collaboration and information sharing among the different sections of the RO, working towards COVID-19 vaccine rollout. Key challenges related to the short-term nature of funding for immediate pandemic response, with insufficient resources made available to address more long-term requirements to build resilience in the existing systems. It was also observed that not all countries have managed to innovate and harmonize data management at the same pace as vaccination was being rolled out, with RO support needs expected to continue, particularly where parallel systems have been set up, to synergise with the existing systems. The use of digital technology for COVID-19 provides an opportunity to strengthen health systems more broadly. 
 
Robust engagement with ASEAN continued in 2021 – they remain a critical partner for the adoption of regional frameworks that not only set standards for the member states and elevate key child rights issues in the region, but also provide an important advocacy tool for COs. Key lessons from such regional engagement include: (i) regional entities such as ASEAN has political access to the decision-makers and senior officials through various platforms and mechanisms (e.g. Ministers’ regular meetings); (ii) identifying and supporting ‘champion/lead countries’ ensure better buy-in among the member states and sustainability; (iii) UNICEF is seen as a trusted partner of choice by ASEAN especially for national-level follow up and implementation and (iv) UNICEF could serve a catalytic role to facilitate and support South-South cooperation among the member states.  
 
UNICEF EAPRO’s support to child online protection championed an integrated approach, based on the evidence of an online-offline continuum of violence against children. Therefore, it positions child online protection within the broader child protection system strengthening approach and leverages existing prevention and response structures, while also bringing the online-specific sectors such as industry stakeholders to the table. The safeguarding risks of engaging with digital media is considerable, requiring RO and HQ oversight on new initiatives.  
 
In terms of humanitarian response, the Myanmar crisis has brought EAPRO’s emergency response the forefront of its programming. It showed that EAPRO has a vital role to play in support of country-level programming, including in countries such as Thailand that were affected by the Myanmar crisis but did not have nutrition expertise in the office. However, there is more room for exchanges within EAPRO to align its overall support to emergencies, in terms of approach and capacity. In addition, it will remain important to evaluate whether EAPRO staff should play functions that are ideally fulfilled by staff affiliated with the concerned Country Offices.  
 
The RO pursued innovative ways to further the resilience agenda in the region. For instance, together with climate section, it carried out a virtual technical support mission to Cambodia, which involved bilateral consultations with climate/DRR focal points and the individual programme teams on potential entry points and opportunities for risk-informed programming. The mission concluded with a set of recommendations for the office on mainstreaming climate and disaster resilience into their country programme. Similarly, the joint climate and DRR network meeting provided an excellent opportunity to promote convergence of climate change and DRR approaches in the region, thereby contributing to a more coherent and synergistic resilience approach.  
 
While significant progress has been made on PSEA, there are still gaps in country level implementation. COs require continued and sustained technical support from the RO, clear guidance from HQ on the applicability of the PSEA framework in non humanitarian settings and clear direction on the integration of child safeguarding and PSEA. 
"
EAPR,Fiji (Pacific Islands),Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The COVID-19 pandemic continued to provide numerous lessons and opportunities to be innovative and experiment with new approaches to achieve results for children at scale. 
 
The pandemic created opportunities to use new data collection technologies such as the MICS Plus and HFPM surveys conducted in collaboration with the World Bank, which provided timely, critical evidence on the social impacts of COVID-19 on children and women. Building on the World Bank’s expertise, HFPM is a cost-effective, rapid, innovative tool for data collection during emergencies, such as COVID-19 and climate-induced disasters. This collaboration resulted in the joint publication of HFPM survey findings, which amplified the advocacy efforts to strengthen policy, planning, and financing for children, women, and other vulnerable groups. 
 
The importance of quality data in several programme areas is being increasingly recognized. Access to simple, user-friendly digital tools for data collection and analysis is crucial for creating more demand for data, and empowering partners to use data for their planning and programming. MICS EAGLE (Education Analysis for Global Learning and Equity) has been introduced to the region, providing the opportunity for a more focussed use of MICS data to inform education policy and planning (Kiribati: survey completed; Tonga: survey commenced; Samoa/Fiji: surveys in planning). Encouraging a hands-on approach, with a range of ministry staff involved in the development of the MICS EAGLE surveys, creates a more inclusive environment for policy discussion, particularly in relation to issues of equity. However, the validity of and access to education data remains a challenge across the region. In FSM, the Department of Health and Social Affairs and the Department of Education worked with the AKVO Foundation to collect WinHCF, WinS, COVID-19 awareness, and COVID-19 vaccination data for their planning and programming. 
 
COVID-19 led to the critical realization that a more comprehensive approach to risk-informed planning and DRR is required. In particular, increased attention is needed around disease outbreaks, noting that COVID-19 was not the first time an outbreak caused school closures in the region. For instance, 2019 saw schools in multiple countries closed for measles and/or dengue outbreaks. Education in emergencies (EiE) and DRR work, which has traditionally focused exclusively on natural hazards, should expand to include other risks to the education system. This shift in approach was initiated in 2020 and is ongoing. 
 
Another key lesson learned is that a multi-sectoral approach is crucial to successful resource mobilization. Significant resources were pledged by several key donors, including USAID, DFAT, MFAT and the Government of Japan, thanks in part to UNICEF’s ability to deliver results, but largely by underscoring the importance of and presenting the value of a multi-sectoral, integrated approach on health, WASH and C4D in COVID responses. For instance, WASH has been an integral part of soliciting funding for vaccine roll-out through the health system, with funds leveraged for improvements in critically needed WinHCF.
 
Logistics and travel restrictions made the transport of supplies particularly challenging. However, this situation provided an opportunity for UNICEF and partners to expand and strengthen the engagement of local suppliers, which increased the availability of items and, in many cases, reduced procurement costs. Long-term agreements with some of the local suppliers are now in place to supply some WASH items locally, such as handwashing materials, soap, and WASH kits.
 
Great strides were made to commit UNICEF’s resources on the government budget book in nine countries. This so-called “on-plan, on-budget and on-system” approach will help governments improve transparency and accountability to reduce systematic fragmentation and the potential for overlaps and gaps, and to support the transition to full country ownership. UNICEF Pacific’s guidance note for annual work planning, which includes the ‘on-plan, on-budget’ approach for all programme sections, was developed to strengthen line ministry planning and budgeting capacities, improve public finance management and align UNICEF’s funding to sector and national priorities through appropriation in the national budget. Annual commitment letters across sections will be provided to the ministries of planning and finance aligned with country budget cycles, copying line ministries to enhance accountability. Learning illustrates that joint planning, and the provision of commitment letters are only the first step in achieving ‘on-plan, on-budget’ objectives and are insufficient to ensure commitments are appropriated and reflected in the budget books. Further work is needed to take it to the next step and improve the accuracy of the commitments reflected on the budget books. 
Supportive supervision has been the entry point for UNICEF and MoHs’ PHC quality reform. One important lesson is that supportive supervision must be coupled with building leadership and management capacity at the sub-national level to be effective. Without these simultaneous actions, the ability of sub-national health management teams to follow-up on supportive supervision recommendations are limited, system and health worker confidence are slowly undermined, and quality remains unchanged. An example of this is in the South Tarawa District in Kiribati, where four supportive supervision visits have been conducted for each facility. While service quality trends are generally positive, all facilities continue to provide sub-standard services, largely due to unactioned recommendations linked to oversight, management and data for decision-making. 
 
Recognizing that most social workers in the Pacific lack sufficient capacity and/or educational background, a specific training adapted to the social, cultural, and economic context of PICTs and to the profile of their social service workforces needs to be developed. The training should be competency-based and define learning objectives in terms of knowledge, attitudes, and practices to be acquired, use adult education methodologies, start from, and build on participants’ experience and engage them in reflective practice. To ensure that the newly acquired knowledge and skills are applied, a supportive supervision, monitoring and reporting system needs to be established.
    
        

        

        

        

        

    
"
EAPR,Indonesia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In 2021, UNICEF Indonesia gained lessons learned notably relating to evidence-based programmes at scale, subnational implementation through field offices, agile and risk-informed programmes, and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on programmes. 
National and subnational programme implementation 
Considering strong decentralized governance and unequal fiscal and human capacity for planning and delivery of quality services among subnational governments in the vast Indonesian archipelago, UNICEF focuses on capacity development and programme convergence for results at scale within eight provinces. In 2021, technical assistance to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA) led to adoption of a new set of performance indicators for programme coordination and monitoring by provincial governments and enhanced reporting to national intersectoral programming bodies. Towards a strategic, evidence-based use of MOHA’s function of emitting policy and budget allocation guidance to subnational governments, the development of a methodology to document good practices and proven programmatic approaches was supported. Furthermore, the resumption of joint field monitoring with representatives of key line ministries and directorates of the Ministry of National Development Planning (BAPPENAS) enabled direct feedback from districts supported by UNICEF. Joint field monitoring will henceforth be conducted twice a year to provide insights into results of cooperation. 
In parallel, close cooperation, advocacy and technical support between seven UNICEF field offices and supported provincial and district/city governments enabled progress towards at-scale implementation of key policies and programmes supported upstream. For instance, evidence-based nutrition services for adolescents were advanced through updated national School Health Programme guidance that was disseminated to all 34 provinces. This was followed by capacity development of programme managers and service providers to deliver adolescent-friendly nutrition services in 50 districts across seven provinces. Similarly, technical assistance was provided in defining service frameworks and SOPs for the protection of women and children from violence, and ongoing support is now provided to the roll-out in 62 districts across 10 provinces. In Aceh Province, an integrated stunting reduction programme piloted convergent approaches including community-based nutrition, immunization, water and sanitation, social protection and parenting education programmes. Based on comparative results between intervention and indirect learning districts from the ongoing evaluation, UNICEF will further develop models of integrated programming and broad-based capacity development within focus provinces in 2022 and beyond. 
Contextual adaptation, innovation and evidence-based advocacy 
Indonesia is a country with resources and opportunities for, as well as bottlenecks and barriers to, achievement of at-scale results for children. Adapting to the context and identifying and utilizing country-specific resources and capabilities have been essential to progress in key programme components. In Nutrition, the first-ever study on acceptability and efficacy of ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) using local ingredients instead of peanuts was completed with Government and local private companies. Findings will support issuance of national regulations on RUTF production in Indonesia. In immunization and COVID-19 response, work with faith-based community organizations contributed to overcoming vaccine hesitancy and addressing important community-held questions related to halal/haram. Engagement with religious and customary leaders also contributed to a shift of perceptions on disciplining children, promoting positive parenting and preventing bullying in school settings, as well as reducing the number of child marriage dispensations. A new collaboration with the Ministry of Religious Affairs expands reach to religious communities for prevention of violence against children in pesantren (Islamic boarding schools) and child marriage. 
Evidence generation and synthesis, jointly implemented with government stakeholders, proved a good strategy for generating momentum on insufficiently addressed cross-sectoral issues, such as participation of children in decision-making and urbanization. A Situation Analysis on Adolescent Participation and Civic Engagement completed with BAPPENAS to strengthen adolescent participation in informing planning and budgetary priorities across the country, spurred the parallel incorporation of ‘adolescent circles’ into the subnational planning process in five provinces. The Situation Analysis highlights experiences of the urban poor and marginalized groups in accessing basic services, providing a roadmap of concrete actions for every child and youth in Indonesian cities for policymakers and development partners. Similarly, the ongoing Climate Landscape Analysis for Children, conducted with the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, 19 line ministries and subnational governments, will set a baseline and objectives for climate and environment action for and with children in Indonesia. UNICEF also supported a study on the impact of climate change on sanitation services successfully raised awareness at the national and subnational levels, where all key stakeholders agreed upon the need to mainstream climate change considerations into WASH planning processes. Adolescent health, a newly formed portfolio under the 2021–2025 Country Programme, placed emphasis on generating evidence regarding issues affecting this group, namely non-communicable diseases, climate change, mental health and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescent health and well-being. 
Innovations, both social and tech-based, were deployed across programmes and operations, including novel ways of working for results with partners, communities and supporters. Working during the pandemic enabled greater progress than originally envisioned in certain areas, such as digital education. Innovation was propelled by steady demand from government partners to rapidly increase the availability of inclusive digital learning programmes, and their quality, as well as interest from educators and students in engaging with new kinds of teaching and learning during lengthy school closures. Implementation of digital education work produced several key lessons, including the importance of engaging MOECRT right from the beginning to ensure the programme could be fully integrated into national digital learning platforms and budget allocation processes. Participatory consultations and testing with young people as end users were very important, especially in addressing sensitive issues, such as reproductive health, religious diversity and body image. 
Innovation was key in resource mobilization. Not being able to perform face-to-face fundraising for a large part of the year due to COVID-19 restrictions significantly harmed donor acquisition. UNICEF sought to tap into a new audience of online donors with the development of e-Wallets for donors without credit cards. More than 75 per cent of new online donors now sign up for payment with their e-Wallet, which proves UNICEF Indonesia’s strategic decision two years ago right to invest in this payment channel rather than classic credit card donations. 
"
EAPR,Lao People's Dem Rep.,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In 2021, the COVID-19 response highlighted the importance of using adaptive and risk management strategies, both for UNICEF’s programmes and operational support to programmes. The need to maintain and further upscale programme delivery within particularly challenging conditions highlighted that UNICEF’s programmatic effectiveness and efficiency was critically dependent on the support provided by its operations. Operational readiness allowed UNICEF allowed to bring in PPE and other COVID-19 related supplies in a timely manner, which was appreciated by Government and partners. Moreover, the COVID-19 response was designed to take into consideration UNICEF's longer-term commitment to building resilient systems for delivering essential services to children and women.

Against this background, the UNICEF Laos Country Office (LCO) response to the COVID-19 pandemic led to many innovations. Key examples include the rapid expansion of UNICEF’s cold chain support to facilitate appropriate storage and delivery of COVID-19 and regular vaccines through online supervision of pre-installation components at subnational levels, coupled with new private sector engagement for quality control of cold chain equipment, or the expansion of online and digital learning in education. 

Following the April 2021 lockdown, many aspects of life came to a complete halt, including education. The 2020 lockdown had enabled a range of options to maintain learning, and these were expanded in 2021, including television, radio, and online options, benefiting from an estimated 92% of households with access to mobile phones and television. The worsening of the COVID-19 situation in 2021 necessitated a re-prioritization of key interventions and intensifying the focus on mitigating learning loss and ensuring schools can open and operate safely. This required maintenance of UNICEF’s regular programming whilst ensuring COVID-19 response interventions fit into the humanitarian-development nexus, so investments were sustained. 

As more children have learned remotely, digital technology has become an essential feature of learning and yet children from the poorest families, in the most rural/remote locations, with disabilities and from ethnic minorities are far less likely to have access to digital technologies. The introduction of the MoES Khang Panya Lao digital learning platform, for example, while seen as a COVID-19 response was also designed as a long-term solution to provide learning resources, blended learning options and improve the digital literacy of students and teachers. Khang Panya Lao, based on the global Learning Passport initiative, has enormous potential to expand access to quality learning materials and increase digital literacy skills among Lao children and teachers. Its growth from 0 to close to 70,000 users across all provinces in a matter of months demonstrated strong interest in digital learning. Key to expanding its reach beyond urban centres was partnership, including with internet service providers and/or other private sector players bringing learning innovation to areas without internet and/or electricity. UNICEF has been exploring partnerships with the private sector and sources various IT-related solutions, including offline hub technology, opportunities for solar powered IT equipment, and partnership with internet services providers to zero-rate Khang Panya Lao learning content or reduce internet fees. There were promising signs of inter-ministerial commitment and support from partners like the World Bank, ADB, UNDP, etc. linking this to the broader digital transformation for Lao PDR.  A key learning was that partnering with the Government, the private sector and development partners has been essential to the long-term sustainability of digital learning and to reducing the digital divide across the country.

During the COVID pandemic, innovative digital technologies also flourished in the health sector. The IMNCI application and computerized module was rolled out in Lao language across the University of Health Sciences, Public Schools, Technical Nursing School, Department of Healthcare and Rehabilitation, Health Vocational Training Center, Department of Health Professional Education, Pharmacy Faculty of University of Health Science, and Health Facilities. The modeling of the remote supervision on Early Essential Newborn Care and Kangaroo Mother Care was completed in provincial and district hospitals and included weekly virtual meetings between the health facility team and the central supervisors. Feedback was gathered from participants to provide a proposed model which could be scaled to other hospitals. Monthly online webinars for peripheral hospitals focusing on essential topics including neonatal sepsis facilitated by national and international experts, including the Pediatric Teaching Department of the University of Melbourne. 

Responding to the rapid calls of various programmes requests and building on previous emergency response to the pandemic, the Operations section of UNICEF Lao PDR had to actively explore and implement efforts in simplification and adaptation to the context allowing for increased quality results and organizational performance. Many of these operations efforts were employed and innovated in a learning-by-doing style, adjusting operations to the emergency response. 

The pandemic has also affected UNICEF’s working modalities which shifted drastically, from a traditional culture of promoting physical presence to remote functioning, affecting the way UNICEF and partners work together. As teleworking was the way to deliver results, the ICT unit ensured business continuity by providing all ICT services for users working from home. The experience of lockdown and related working from home has demonstrated the potential for further efficiencies, such as increasing offsite support to staff and decreasing travel, event management, and logistics transactions. Maintaining the IT infrastructures and the online platforms such as the Enterprise Content Management (ECM)/SharePoint, MS TEAMS, Zoom and Docu-Sign continued to be effective in teleworking.

The proactiveness and efficiency of the supply and admin teams in the procurement and implementation of COVID-19 prevention measures were vital for the office to equip and create a safe working space. The office swiftly procured PPE materials which were regularly distributed to all staff. Further streamlining of UNICEF Lao PDR’s operational response will be explored in the areas of supply, IT, logistics, finance, human resources and administration, to positively impact the programme delivery of results for children and women. Within the new thinking of development-humanitarian nexus, it will be vital to further establish organizational guidance for operations teams on how to better link and integrate with the programme side.

EAPR,Malaysia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Flexibility and the openness to adapt methodologies to largely unexpected and changing scenarios continued to be a key lesson learned during 2021. From finding new ways of working and forging new relationships, UNICEF was able to adapt programming to meet the needs of children and their families during a challenging year. Many events, programmes, launches and study trips were moved to the virtual contexts to comply with COVID-19-related restrictions. These virtual events enabled greater participation, inclusivity and reach, as many barriers to in-person involvement - such as travel costs, venue accessibility, logistics and time – were eliminated or reduced. UNICEF also took measures to strengthen and promote the equitable participation of adolescents, including those with disabilities, and plans to provide targeted accessibility support such as data vouchers to young people from low-resource settings. The risks inherent in a virtual environment necessitate the establishment and enforcement of clear child protection protocols and counselling services. Establishing digital learning communities alongside platforms will increase their successful, sustained and safe use. 

In 2021, partnerships were key to robust (virtual) programming. Through collaboration with media and education partners, UNICEF was able to develop interactive programmes maximising the use of video conferencing features. For instance, the launch of the State of the World’s Children was simultaneously held live on television and Facebook Live, presented on MOH’s and UNICEF’s Facebook pages, and posted on both the Minister of Health’s individual account and the BERNAMA news agency main platform. BERNAMA and UNICEF are now looking to build on this experience with a more formal, long-term cooperation. A critical lesson learned is the need to enlist existing innovation stakeholders to advocate for child rights. Our collaboration with MaGIC demonstrated significant potential for involving the private sector in advancing children’s outcomes while fostering entrepreneurship among young start-ups. Additionally, it has the potential to serve as a sustainable model for integrating innovation into UNICEF programming.

Programme interventions must be localised to the Malaysian context and incorporate robust gender-integrated and disability-inclusive planning, monitoring and evaluation. Online teaching and learning platforms that incorporate accessibility features and offline learning materials/packs can help teachers and students with disabilities and marginalised groups of children overcome barriers. In that vein, UNICEF adapted an equity approach to extending access to the Teacher Digital Learning Community to all teachers. The Learning Community utilises Google Classroom and Telegram groups, Google Earth for creation of learning resources, Discord for alternative platforms and a Telegram bot for mobile learning. 

The VaksinNation campaign, which performed well on Instagram, was met with demands for content in additional dialects. This paves the way to future use of dark posts targeted to a specific audience. The official launch of the inclusive playground in the City of Elmina has been moved to 2022 to safeguard against any reputational risks that may result from launching a space of play amidst lockdowns.

There needs to be a greater emphasis on innovation and creativity in climate campaigns, advocacy and communications to effectively engage and empower young people in the climate movement. This was reflected in the capacity-building training sessions held in the run-up to the 26th Conference of the Parties, as well as the development of the country’s first flagship climate report, “Impact of Climate Change on Children: A Malaysian Perspective”. 
The pandemic disrupted face-to-face nutrition training, such as for child growth assessment or infant and young child feeding counselling, that cannot be transferred to the virtual space. Capacity building to improve the delivery of nutrition programmes during emergencies and humanitarian situations is in the pipeline. In addition, partner capacities – which remain an obstacle to the sustainability and scaling up of nutrition programmes – should be considered in the design and implementation phase of programming.

The impact of COVID-19 on research was initially underestimated. Given the challenges of gathering primary data during the pandemic, existing reports and data sources were heavily mined and validated or built upon, rather than duplicated. Key informant interviews replaced focus group discussions and there were delays due to multiple lockdowns, research fatigue amongst researchers and respondents and limitations in remote data collection methods. This impacted the birth registration study on children affected by migration, a needs assessment for children in street situations in Sabah and the mapping of SSW work, as well as led to the postponement of the national survey of children living in residential care.

The Social Policy workstream was significantly affected by the demands of Country Programme Document (CPD) revision in 2021. Furthermore, restrictions on in-person meetings complicated stakeholder consultations, while Malaysia’s mid-year political reconfiguration made policy engagement very difficult. In the context of continuing political uncertainty at the Federal level, State engagement could offer an alternative channel for delivering results for children at scale, with potential for feedback loops to federal policy-making. 

The UNCT study about the undocumented population in Sabah has highlighted the need to support the development of a joint UN engagement strategy on children affected by migration, refugees, the stateless and other undocumented children. 

After severe December rainfall affected more than 70,000 in eight different Malaysian states, it would be prudent for UNICEF to review and update its disaster preparedness plan, with related staff training on child safeguarding protocols and referral pathways. 

The pandemic has also underlined the importance of donor retention and value maximization in difficult times. As the continuity of call centre operation was a major challenge, an incentive system was introduced to motivate agents, achieving partial success. In 2021, PFP reduced expenditures by an estimated MYR400K per year and invested in a healthy mix of diversification in acquisition channels, with proven results.

"
EAPR,Mongolia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons learned: In partnership with the Government of Mongolia, UNICEF commissioned an evaluation of implementation of the Child Protection Law. The evaluation examined the efforts and commitments of duty bearers at national, subnational and community levels (soum and bagh ) in Ulaanbaatar and Bayan-Ulgii, Khuvsgul and Umnu-Gobi Provinces from 2016 until mid-2020. The Evaluation Reference Group, which comprised officials from sectoral ministries and agencies, validated the findings and conclusions, and agreed with the recommendations to do more to protect children from risks of harm.
An external evaluation of ‘UNICEF’s geographic targeting approach in programming’ was conducted in a timely manner to assess its achievements in Mongolia and inform the design of the next CPD. The evaluation offers several recommendations and lessons learned on UNICEF’s geographic targeting approach and ways to improve its effectiveness. The Management Response Plan was approved for implementation of the recommendations and to help strategize the geographic targeting approach for its next CPD. The findings, recommendations and lessons learned from the above two major evaluations are feeding into the development of the next CPD for 2023–2027 and UNSDCF.
The MCO learned that the success of the CFCI largely depends on multisectoral coordination, collaboration and partnership. The CFCI is successful when multisectoral cooperation and partnership is well cultivated, involving all key stakeholders, including local and national authorities, service providers, the private sector, CSOs, NGOs, communities and children. The depth of these partnerships varies, from dissemination of information to financial support and implementation of the CFCI. Therefore, local governments should continue playing a key role in leading and strengthening these partnerships under CFCI.
Emerging opportunities: The COVID-19 pandemic worsened the underlying challenges of sustainable development and resulted in the reversal of achievements in child well-being. However, it has also created opportunities for economic diversification, digitalization and regional cooperation, while confirming the essential need for improved emergency preparedness in social sectors and strengthened shockresponsiveness of existing social protection system. There are a number of emerging opportunities that can help advance child rights, close gaps in service delivery and promote inclusive green growth.
· Mongolia has a vast potential for renewable energy, which creates opportunities for green economic development, and decreasing both air pollution and energy dependency. The provision of basic social services using solar and wind energy sources is a real opportunity to reach the most disadvantaged.
· The Government’s recent launch of the digital platform ‘E-Mongolia’, which provides over 180 public services, demonstrates enormous digital opportunities and innovation brought by technologies. This could create opportunities to resolve inequality and education gaps among all social groups. Expansion of e-governance will bring services and public good closer to communities.
· There is an opportunity to create more fiscal space for social spending by strengthening macroeconomic and fiscal management, as well as by improving revenue generation and increasing the efficiency of public expenditures. There is room to increase revenue collection by making tax rates more progressive and broadening the tax base, and by strengthening the tax administration.
· Mongolia is developing an Integrated National Financing Framework, which aims to align financing with development priorities but also to mobilize new financial resources for sustainable development, especially from the private sector.
· South-South cooperation in terms of technology transfers, sharing of solutions and experts, and other forms of exchanges is an important opportunity for Mongolia. Especially, the neighbouring China is actively promoting South-South cooperation around the world and between various public and private actors.
Innovation: UNICEF has continued supporting youth engagement to address air pollution and climate change. YOUCCAN has attracted over 7,000 children across the country: 2,766 teenagers participated in training and 3,250 children took part in youth/child-led projects. YOUCCAN activities, including training for children, contests among CWD, UNLEASH Hackathon digital solutions, a design thinking workshop co-organized with HQ, and community activities reached over 176,000 children nationwide. Some 5,000 children learned about energy-efficient solutions to replace coal with electric heating and also about cooking, heating and insulation solutions for Mongolian traditional tent homes (gers). More than 21,000 children and young people responded to online surveys on the environment, climate change and its impacts. Building on these results, UNICEF has implemented a YOUCCAN project through Innovation set-aside funding, with the aim to capacitate YOUCCAN members, enhance awareness of government authorities about the importance of children's participation in decision-making, equip children with knowledge about climate change, and create a platform to influence decisions affecting the rights of children to a safe, healthy, clean and sustainable environment. As a part of the project, the Teen Parliament initiative was launched jointly with the Sub-Standing Committee of the Parliament on SDGs. Ninety members of the Teen Parliament aged 15–17 years old were equipped with knowledge on climate change, air pollution and child rights to a clean environment; and learned about communication tools and gained skills to communicate, lead, act and advocate for climate change decisions and actions. Teen Parliament members directly reached 10,617 children, engaged 33,800 children through social media and online platforms, and mobilized 4,257 children in their community actions on climate change, air and soil pollution, and waste reduction. The Teen Parliament created space and opportunity for 
children to speak up about environmental issues through media, social platforms and face-to-face meetings with government authorities and Parliament members. An online platform (serser.mn) ensures that young people have easy access to environmental and climate policies and can verify the adoption of environmental child rights asks by policymakers.
This cross-cutting environment and youth initiative has enabled children to become champions for environmental acts and the rights of children, and motivated them to contribute to national climate change commitments that the country has made. Currently the Teen Parliamentarians are advocating on the importance of indoor air quality in educational buildings.

"
EAPR,Myanmar,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Against the backdrop of COVID-19, the military takeover on 1 February and continuing crisis, UNICEF MCO focused on, and expanded its approach to, the delivery of humanitarian assistance. Opportunities for enhanced programmes have been identified in all sectors.
 
As a first example, the military takeover triggered nationwide protests, with many adolescents and young people among the protestors. As the demonstrations intensified, crowd-control measures adopted by the law enforcement agencies and security forces also became stronger. UNICEF, through its child protection programme, quickly responded to the fast-evolving situation of the arbitrary arrests and detention of young protestors by changing its existing justice for children interventions and expanding the programme to provide legal aid services.
 
UNICEF shifted programme priorities from legislative reforms to “quick impact” interventions and worked with CSO partners to help those affected by the crisis. By mid-February, UNICEF had:
·       mobilized implementing partners to set up justice hotlines in several ethnic languages
·       disseminated a “justice tip sheet” for children and adolescents (explaining what to do when they get arrested) through various channels
·       amended existing partnership agreements to expand service delivery as well as established new partnerships. 
 
In April, UNICEF also initiated the monthly Community of Practice (CoP) forum inviting all the partner lawyers and some external human rights experts. The CoP played an instrumental role in bringing together practitioners facing similar challenges.
 
Since the military takeover, several legal amendments have been introduced in the country, affecting the way children come into conflict with the law and their access to legal aid and other services. The CoP has helped lawyers to explore ways to assist children and adopt a collective “learning by doing” approach. Practical solutions, including how to access detainees, and how to support families to file requests at a military court, were exchanged. By May, UNICEF had more than 80 partner lawyers covering 10 out of 15 states and regions. During the May CoP, UNICEF also involved the case management task force to ensure children received necessary post-release support — much of which is usually facilitated by the case workers.
 
The “case management tip sheet for lawyers” was introduced to bridge a gap between lawyers and social workers. UNICEF also introduced a common monitoring and reporting template for all partner lawyers to report weekly, so that real-time data on children in conflict with the law was available. This data has been used for advocacy undertaken through various channels. Between February and November 2021 UNICEF, through implementing partners, provided legal aid support for:
·       719 children (385 male and 334 female)
·       752 young people (520 male and 232 female) including 59 children (53 male and 6 female) allegedly associated with armed actors
·       178 children (48 male and 130 female) in migration detention (pre-trial detention and prosecution of children who are charged under the Immigration act 1949 and 1951)
The number of children assisted by legal aid is on the rise, and this prolonged crisis will continue to take its toll on children
 
By the end of November, 149 out of the 719 children assisted with legal aid had also received case management support and were referred to specialized services such as MHPSS and medical services. Considering the fact that only a handful of partner lawyers collaborated with social workers in February, more than 20 per cent of children being referred to child protection case workers is a notable development. If this cross-sectoral collaboration becomes a norm it will contribute to the strengthening of the child protection system in Myanmar.
 
Furthermore, efforts by UNICEF Myanmar to advocate for timely, safe and equitable distribution of incoming COVAX vaccine allocations have demonstrated how UNICEF can add value through coordinating its partners to engage in coherent advocacy on key issues. Starting in June 2021, UNICEF began engaging actively with multiple development partners, member states and CSOs to identify strategic opportunities to advocate on the COVAX-allocated vaccines. UNICEF led the development of a shared advocacy strategy setting out division of responsibilities and key messaging, which was utilised by partners in their engagements with key stakeholders. UNICEF engaged with ASEAN, the UN Special Envoy and other stakeholders, mobilizing them to advocate in support of identified advocacy priorities and sharing messaging and evidence to support these efforts.
 
As an impartial, credible actor with strong technical expertise and access to a wide network of stakeholders, UNICEF has a strong comparative advantage in coordinating advocacy efforts that go beyond the deployment of communications tactics such as press statements or publication of reports. Its broad network of partners means that when it lacks influence with a particular stakeholder, it is often able to leverage relationships with other stakeholders and engage them as advocates. Through its efforts, UNICEF has coordinated a coherent approach to joint advocacy by a coalition of partners. While it is challenging to attribute high level action or policy shifts to specific advocacy activities, it is worth noting that, following these advocacy efforts, Myanmar de facto authorities consented to the import and distribution of initial consignments of COVAX vaccine doses, to be distributed in line with UNICEF’s advocacy approach. 
 
Lessons learned from UNICEF’s efforts to coordinate a coherent advocacy approach by multiple partners around vaccine advocacy will inform future efforts to expand advocacy on other key priorities, including education and MHPSS. These lessons include the need to achieve clarity at an early stage on division of responsibilities, arrive at agreed objectives and key messages and seek opportunities to mobilize non-traditional partners and platforms in support of advocacy efforts. 

"
EAPR,Papua New Guinea,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF PNG captured numerous lessons learned throughout 2021 through monitoring its work. A synopsis of these lessons learned is captured below. 
Accountability to Affected People (AAP): Recognising AAP as a key component of the CCCs, the first AAP Action Plan was drafted to be finalised in 2022. UNICEF PNG made the AAP AGORA online course a priority learning exercise for the Office, to facilitate the implementation of the Plan. This status puts the planned RO AAP mission in good standing, as it was postponed to 2022 due to COVID-19.
 
Risk-Informed Programming: The risk register and monthly risk analysis was critical for implementation as COVID-19 brought about an increasingly volatile programme environment. Programme designs were affected (i.e. Convergence Programme), and many were adapted (i.e. routine immunisation) along with the monitoring modalities, which often included hybrid, online and offline, approaches. The Office had to undergo several iterations of reprogramming to ensure the continued achievement of results. Various contingencies needed to be considered to ensure timely programme delivery and quality assurance, including the use of virtual meeting applications, consultations, knowledge-generating activities, remote training and capacity building.
 
Contingency Planning: The Office faced difficulties in transport and logistics due to the global disruption of supply chains. UNICEF will establish a warehouse in Port Moresby after the feasibility and risk analysis was completed. This will limit delays in delivering much-needed supplies and facilitate emergency programming, as supplies are currently warehoused in Brisbane. 
 
Refocused and Hybrid Staffing: Recruitment was one of the challenges COVID-19 posed during the year, largely because of visa processing delays and travel restrictions. Recognising the severity of COVID-19, UNICEF staff stepped up to the challenge. Many staff expanded their roles to focus primarily on emergency response (i.e. C4D Chief, Nutrition Chief, Immunization Specialist). Also, the Office availed of online surge support from Regional and Global Offices and National Committees. 
Co-creation of programmes: UNICEF's partnership with the National Committees of Australia and New Zealand brought the opportunity to co-design the Convergence Programme to be supported by their respective Governments. The three offices designed the Programme, including two district-level multi-sectoral baseline assessments and an extensive consultation process. 
 
Programme Convergence: The review of previous convergence programming attempts brought about several lessons learned to be addressed in the design and implementation of the current Programme; these included: 
Shifting partners' priorities: incorporated key child and adolescent results and indicators as part of the preparatory work as an agreement of priorities. The inclusion of short, medium and long term expected results reiterate the time required to see different levels of results. This will be further supported with work plans drafted and reviewed annually with District stakeholders to reiterate the priorities. 
Limited partner capacity: Incorporated stakeholder analysis in the preparatory work to ensure available capacity is present on the ground. Capacity building initiatives are planned with partners to strengthen programme implementation. 
Limited CO capacity: The coordination of the previous Programme was with a volunteer in the CO who wore multiple hats. This contributed to the shift in capacity to ensure continuity in implementation, even in the background of an emergency. As such, the CO will have a dedicated staff for the Programme to ensure effective implementation 
Limited ability to demonstrate measurable results at the sub-national level: Many information systems cannot generate quality, accurate data at the district level. The preparatory phase for the Programme incorporated an evaluability assessment to ensure that the subsequent Programme evaluation could be completed as planned. 
Funding availability: The convergence approach with UN Agencies is also ongoing in the Highlands in the wake of the 2018 earthquake. However, plagued with funding mobilisation challenges, many activities have not been implemented, impeding the full convergence approach to be achieved. As such, the new funding approach of UNICEF PNG, the Australian and New Zealand National Committees, channelling the support of their respective Governments to fund the Programme, has been a welcome innovation.
 
High-Level Advocacy:  Strategic and purposeful advocacy is critical to ensuring that the investment in children is sustained and expanded and impactful interventions are implemented. This strategy has been employed across all sectors in the Office. For example, UNICEF's targeted advocacy with the country's First Lady, Parliamentarians and community leaders brought significant support and investment for maternal and newborn health in the past. 
 
Partnerships for Geographic Equity-Base Programming: Reaching the most marginalised communities was extremely challenging. For example, to distribute education supplies, two motored boats maintained and operated by provincial education officials were used to travel along the North Fly River. These voyages traversing the diverse and challenging terrains to reach remote villages are common as more than 80% of people live in rural areas. This reiterates the critical partnerships with CSOs, FBOs and the Private sector to leverage their networks to achieve results for children.
 
Digital Transition: The CO drafted its first Technology for Development strategy considering the Office's strides in digitising processes and embracing the digital transition. The Office has brought in mSupply to monitor the deployment of COVID-19 in real-time and facilitate remote monitoring of vaccine stores.  
Despite the challenges presented this year, these lessons learned, in conjunction with the 2021 achievements and partnerships, demonstrate UNICEF PNG’s steadfast commitment to achieving results for children. While it can be assumed that COVID-19 will continue to present challenges in 2022, several opportunities are apparent. UNICEF PNG will use the above lessons learned and opportunities from the penultimate year of the country programme not only in the preparation of its 2022 Annual Management Plan to accelerate outcomes for children, but also to inform and influence the country’s next Medium-Term Development Plan, the new UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework, and the Office’s new Country Programme which will be designed in 2022. The Office has prepared for these opportunities to advocate for child rights. With the 2021 advances in policy frameworks, evidence generation initiatives, quality, equitable service delivery and support to children, adolescents and their families to demand their rights be met, progress towards addressing child rights’ deprivations will continue in 2022.  "
EAPR,Philippines,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The year 2021 was characterized by challenges and lessons learned, presenting opportunities from which UNICEF will shape future programme implementation over the next two years.
 
Systems strengthening through cross-sectoral integration to improve child nutrition
In 2021, a midterm internal review of the country programme highlighted the need for stronger programme integration at both national and sub-national levels. For instance, there was a need to strengthen nutrition-sensitive and nutrition-specific programming with other sectors towards a holistic improvement of child nutrition in the country. 
 
UNICEF supported the continuous delivery of health and nutrition services amid the pandemic through new and adapted implementation approaches such as using online platforms for learning, reviews and coordination at both national and sub-national levels. However, as the impact of the pandemic on the most vulnerable families continued to evolve, the current setup of disjoint service delivery in the country proved to be challenging as new and ongoing programmes, projects and initiatives needed to be brought together for a more efficient implementation. Thus, a stronger programme integration at national and sub-national levels was needed to accelerate results.
 
As a starting point, UNICEF worked with the health, food, education, social protection, and WASH systems to enhance the logistics and supply chain management, and the gathering of integrated quality routine data in the respective sectors. Furthermore, UNICEF supported the training and supportive supervision of 10,447 frontline health care and nutrition workers and 17,564 mothers and caregivers. The series of training covered strategies in (i) strengthening maternal nutrition and infant and young child nutrition, mid-upper arm circumference screening for acute malnutrition, and the implementation of the Philippine Integrated Management of Severe Acute Malnutrition; and (ii) integrating nutrition-sensitive interventions in the prevention, early identification and referral of disability and development delays in early childhood; WASH services; emergency response; social protection in the national poverty alleviation programme; and social and behaviour change communication.
 
Moreover, UNICEF made a deliberate effort to work with local governments to integrate and link programmes and interventions for the first 1,000 days with the communities’ livelihoods and food security activities to enhance children’s diets during the pandemic and beyond. For example, UNICEF continued to support 19 municipalities and cities in three provinces to model the integrated nutrition and early childhood development approach to planning. As a result, the provinces, municipalities and cities developed their Local Nutrition Action Plan with a 68 per cent increase in the budget for nutrition and WASH. Aside from the local plans, ordinances were also developed and passed, with social and behaviour change communication included in the implementation plans. 
 
Moving forward, UNICEF and partners will leverage these developments to enhance the Philippines Multisectoral Nutrition Project; Inter-agency Task Force on Zero Hunger; food systems dialogues; and the emerging coalitions on school meals, zero hunger and healthy diets. At the sub-national level, UNICEF will push for community-level integration to strengthen the interface in barangays. Strengthening local governance and fostering community engagement are essential in advancing policy implementation. The continuous engagement and capacity-building of local chief executives have proven to be quite successful in deepening understanding and investment at the local level, particularly for nutrition. 
 
Innovative solutions using Real-Time Data for evidence-based decision making
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of real-time information and data for evidence-based decision making. UNICEF has increased investments in systems strengthening and capacity-building for sustainable solutions with a focus on ‘technology-solutions’ to strengthen nationally owned systems. As an example, UNICEF provided technical assistance in the creation of a data visualization dashboard that served as a risk assessment tool for DepEd to identify low-risk areas and school readiness for piloting limited in-person classes. The school reopening dashboard incorporates government data on daily COVID-19 rates, risk classification per city/municipality (computed based on two-week growth rate and average daily attack rate) and weekly alert level status. 
 
Similar support was also provided to the BARMM Ministry of Basic, Higher and Technical Education in the development of an Open Data Kit (ODK) form, enabling schools to do self-assessments using DepEd’s School Safety Assessment Tool. An attendant custom dashboard for schools in BARMM then visualizes the data captured from the assessment, enabling the BARMM government to identify schools well-suited to pilot in-person classes. The dashboard continues to inform ongoing evaluations by the DepEd and DOH to identify more schools that can join the pilot and supports the steps and preparations needed for the implementation of the expanded phase of in-person classes targeted to commence in early 2022. 
 
Furthermore, in partnership with DOH, UNICEF supported the Real-time Vaccination Monitoring and Analysis. This provides real-time vaccination, monitoring, and analysis using ODK and data visualization dashboards to quickly inform action, ensuring that reliable data reaches decision-makers fast enough for course corrections and to address implementation bottlenecks. ODK was subsequently used by DOH for both polio and measles-rubella campaigns. The vaccination coverage data from ODK has been adopted and published officially by DOH on its website, with ODK showing potential to be adopted for future supplemental immunization activities.  These models demonstrate practical and sustainable solutions to improve results for children.  

"
EAPR,Thailand,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons from 2021 are both familiar and new for ECD: recruiting fathers for voluntary parenting programmes remains difficult; weak ECD coordination and alignment severely affected the implementation of the ECD national plan; ECD teachers lacked digital technology to engage children; and existing national delivery platforms to reach families with young children and at scale missed essential elements of nurturing care. Furthermore, the feasibility study on taking breastfeeding counselling online at scale showed how young mothers find the current interaction with service providers quite clinical, which informed the user-centred design of the online counselling pilot to be tested in 2022. Smaller-scale activities and interventions demonstrated their agility in going online, especially in consultation with their audience as evidenced in the training of trainers and virtual/hybrid pilot for the new Caregiver’s Curriculum. 
 
Lessons from the pandemic response on the education sector were also multiple. Children, families, and teachers struggled with distant and remote learning, and it was important to engage learners with readily available technology (e.g., basic phones) or home-based learning material, while monitoring learning and providing follow-up support to children, and families. The role teachers/school leaders play in maintaining students’ engagement with education and mitigating the risk of complete disengagement with education did not gain visible traction in policies. There was a significant need for greater flexibility – along with support and alternative options - for compliance with the standardized school re-opening criteria, which affected disadvantaged children disproportionately. 
 
Systematic engagement of young people was critical for overcoming the limited capacities and opportunities for involving them in co-creating and co-designing systems and services. The continuous participation of adolescents with the Bureau of Reproductive Health is leading to the redesign of the MoPH Teen Club health platform, with the inclusion of online counselling and the training of youth from the Children and Youth Council of Thailand as peer counsellors.  
 
Lessons from ongoing skills-building and employability initiatives highlighted the need to harness the power of innovation, digitalization, technologies to scale access to skills and employment opportunities. The current design and development of Thailand's first E-Workforce Ecosystem Platform benefited from recommendations from adolescents to ensure the content of the platform is relevant for the 15-24 age group, including the development of several features (e.g., career guidance apps, videos, chatbots, gamification of labour market issues to support youth in their choices for the future).
 
Co-creation processes, such as the visioning exercise or the evaluation of the National Child Protection Strategy 2017-2022, were instrumental in creating consensus about challenges in child protection system strengthening (e.g., family strengthening services, support to the social service workforce, narrowing the interface between offline and online prevention and response). In addition to improved workforce capacity, the availability of case management tools and supervision mechanisms are critical to ensure quality of services. Despite promising efforts to address online child sexual abuse and exploitation, significant challenges remain, namely gaps in legislation, duplication of efforts, limited collaboration across agencies, lack of specialist tools and support, limited awareness, capacity, and resources of law enforcement, justice, and social support systems for this area.
 
When policy makers at the national and sub-national levels were preoccupied with the pandemic response, maintaining attention on child priorities was challenging. UNICEF used multiple strategies to draw attention to children’s issues (e.g., user-friendly data and analyses; alliances with other partners when making alternative technical proposals to Government). The case of increased investment in school lunch programme demonstrated how such opportunities can be sought through timely and quality evidence generation and broad-based advocacy. 
 
Enhancing the evaluation culture requires time and dedication. Introducing evaluation undertakings into established partnerships and allowing more time for the new partnerships to firm up before conducting any evaluations proved effective. With better evaluation of programmes, Thailand has a great potential for South South and Triangular Cooperation with best practices in child health, HIV/AIDS, and ECD. 
 
The National Children and Youth Committee approved the proposal for universalisation of the Child Support Grant in 2021, however, the decision was not endorsed by the Cabinet. The experience showed that, if the passing of policy proposals is not accompanied by adequate costing and financing proposals, it may not be translated into concrete actions and programmes. Therefore, UNICEF produced analyses on costing and financing of social protection for children, with practical options for expansion of the Child Support Grant, finding traction among the key ministers. UNICEF also used this lesson to introduce an additional step before the visioning exercise to provide an analysis on the financing options for social protection in Thailand. Such analysis is meant to create a common understanding on the “possibilities” and “benefits” of such investment among the key actors from across the spectrum of opinions. 
 
Based on digital and brand strategies, including by conducting ongoing performance monitoring across all digital platforms, UNICEF adjusted, expanded, and improved targeting and overall communication efforts. This resulted in a significant growth in digital performance (both social media and website). 
 
The 2021 advocacy campaigns showed how: (i) younger generation tends to act as amplifiers while older ones show higher level of engagement; (ii) telling complex topics through real-life stories works to both build understanding and attracting support for the cause; (ii) simplified execution with appropriate content and strong promotional support, based on insights, can yield effective results; and (iv) micro influencers and creators yield highly positive results in the outreach of message and engagement with significantly lower cost.  
 
For the first time, the total of 47 “I AM UNICEF” volunteers were mobilised to help in direct COVID-19 response such as packing critical emergency hygiene and education supplies in urban poor communities in Bangkok during the third wave of the pandemic. The volunteer programme allowed flexibility in mobilising urgently needed human resources for COVID-19 response as well as a meaningful supporter engagement and audience outreach through social media stories. Volunteer programme shows a great potential for the wider supporter engagement, especially with the next generation of supporters and donors.

EAPR,Timor-Leste,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"     
Following the floods and  UNICEF assistance to the national response, an internal exercise helped  defined lessons learnt for future emergencies. The experience highlighted the  need to continue to ensure that contingency stocks are available and  prepositioned in country. A challenge that remains is the availability of  storage space for prepositioned relief items, as well as the cost  implications of adequate, long-term storage solutions. Moreover, UNICEF’s  emergency response to the flooding has helped bring attention to the specific  needs of children in emergencies, and particularly the need for protection  and psychosocial support. The humanitarian response has contributed to  building momentum for longer-term programming. For instance, as most families  have returned to their homes and evacuation centres have gradually closed,  the child-friendly spaces have gradually transitioned to community-based  support. These will continue to support children affected by the floods, by  helping to activate and restore support within community and families, aimed  at preventing and addressing domestic violence, child abuse and neglect. In  terms of innovation, to access communities stranded by the floods a floating  raft fixed with 10,000-liters bladder tank was fabricated and deployed to  provide them with access to water.
   
  UNICEF spearheaded a  number of initiatives to provide the tools and capacity for opinion leaders,  donors, the private sector, media and youth to highlight issues faced by  children and families and influence positive actions. The commitment of  different actors was sought by engaging with national, religious, business  and youth leaders on specific issues, such as the need for passage of  long-stalled legislations, increased budget allocations for social sectors,  prevention of infection or spread of COVID-19 (including vaccination),  prevention of violence, and safe learning environments for children. UNICEF  also worked with the Commission on the Rights of the Child to coordinate the  National Child Rights Advocacy Network to discuss challenges children faced  including due to the COVID-19 pandemic and call for action to support  children. UNICEF also supported the Network’s engagement with the National  Parliament on the development of the Children Protection law. 
   
  Another noteworthy  innovation was the development of courses for out-of-school adolescents/youth  through partnerships with INSPER University, Brazil and Massachusetts  Institute of Technology D-Lab providing opportunity for alternative learning  pathways. These courses on subjects like basic financial literacy course and  9 STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics) courses  focus on 21st century skills of communication, collaboration, critical  thinking, and creativity and include modules such as climate change, reusable  sanitary pads, upcycling, handwashing, food preservation, etc. The courses  were developed through an innovative approach engaging youth as co-creators  to ensure the courses were relevant and attractive for Timorese youth. The  courses are available on the Learning Passport platform and will be offered  in 2022 at six (6) Community Learning Centers (CLC) providing alternative  learning pathways for out of school adolescents and youth. 
   
  An innovative funding  scheme supported by UNICEF called ‘Fundu Ki’ik’ (Small Grant), launched in  March by MoEYS, is helping schools in all municipalities to access clean  water and help them protect children against COVID-19 and other diseases like  diarrhea. Under the scheme, selected schools are provided a maximum of USD  1,000 each to help them improve access to water, sanitation and hygiene  facilities. Schools that have not had access to a water source, sometimes for  longer than 10 years, now have access to water freeing up students’ and  teachers’ time from having to fetch water during breaks. The Small Grant  initiative has generated much enthusiasm and active involvement from parents  and communities and several schools continue to apply for the scheme.
   
  Another innovative  practice in 2021 was the ‘reporting back to communities’ exercise that took  place upon the completion of the country-led formative evaluation of  community-led total sanitation (CLTS) in Timor-Leste. The enumerators went  back to 18 of the 21 sites where they had previously conducted focus group  discussions in order to communicate the evaluation findings. A summary of the  findings, written in plain language, as well as innovative sanitation  practices that had been identified during data collection, and photos of the  community, were shared mainly with local leaders, as community members tended  to be busy with livelihood activities. This ‘giving back’ was much  appreciated at community level and sets a new standard for the Country Office  on accountability for population taking part in evidence generation  activities.

EAPR,Vietnam,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons learned 
A key lesson of the 2017-2021 country programme is that while UNICEF has succeeded in supporting the government to adopt more inclusive laws and policies, UNICEF programmes have not sufficiently narrowed equity gaps for the most vulnerable children, notably ethnic minorities, children with disabilities and migrants. Recent evaluations found that widespread discrimination, language barriers and rigid regulations prevent many children and families from fully benefiting from social services.[1] The new country programme will introduce breakthrough solutions that can achieve impact at scale in addressing these challenges for the most vulnerable children. 
 
Data from MICS and an evaluation of the government’s 25-year community midwife programme clearly show a need to focus on inequalities, ethnic minorities, and changing the way UNICEF works. For example, ethnic minority languages, participation and anti-discrimination are the key areas where UNICEF is advocating to design and change strategies of the government’s new National Targeted Programme on Ethnic Minorities and the National Sustainable Poverty Reduction Programme. Lessons learned from evaluations on mother tongue bilingual education led to clear recommendations on the importance of ethnic minority languages in schools, as well as the need to ensure inclusive communication interventions in ethnic minority languages. UNICEF is leveraging its partnership with the Ethnic Council of the National Assembly to advocate for policies which promote the implementation of mother tongue based bilingual education and the development of bilingual textbooks. 

COVID-19 and frequent natural disasters exposed new challenges to the realization of children’s rights and demand the strengthening of coherence between humanitarian and development work. The socio-economic impacts of the pandemic made it even more critical for stakeholders to close the digital divide, address adolescent mental health, strengthen social protection and address violence against women and children. Child-sensitive climate change adaptation, mitigation and disaster risk reduction are also urgently needed. The new country programme will embrace these challenges through innovative and risk-informed programming and expanded, strategic partnerships. 

Innovation

Digital Public Good products have been identified and adopted for piloting in Viet Nam with UNICEF support¿. This includes Vrapeutics for people with disabilities¿, a global digital library and Moodle, a learning management system¿. Moodle was selected as a platform to develop an online learning programme on gender mainstreaming and gender-based violence which enables self-learning for central and local justice officers and other potential public audiences who are interested in the topics. 
 
As part of its COVID-19 response, UNICEF supported MOH to develop a tool for tracking and monitoring vaccine distribution. Vaccine inventory management was initially done manually by MOH staff and presented huge challenges to ensure the timely and accurate collection of data. UNICEF technically supported the development of a user-friendly, automated spreadsheet that facilitates data management and generates dashboard report templates to help MOH track and use data in order to make decisions about vaccine distribution in a timely manner. 
 
For a second year, COVID-19 posed major challenges to reaching front-line workers and communities through traditional workshops and communication channels. As such, UNICEF continued introducing innovative, digitized platforms to ensure the timely and efficient delivery of planned activities, including training courses, workshops, meetings and communications. This helped expand the reach of UNICEF-supported activities and ensured continuity of programme delivery during periods of social distancing.

ECAR,Albania,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Flexible programming and setting of clear priorities 
The on-going Covid-19 pandemic continued to bring to surface deep-rooted bottlenecks in the governance and service provision, requiring urgent and targeted support. Applying flexible programming and an approach to implementing partners to continuously adapt their programming, regularly checking and readjusting priorities, ensured that UNICEF seized the opportunity to bring into the government agenda the introduction of new mechanisms of service delivery, such as cash contribution, blended learning, the use of technology and the burning need of continued investment in human capital. 
 
The development of the country programme document was challenged by the Covid-19 context and its implications. However, through careful planning and on-going communication with partners, the realisation of a robust, evidence-informed and comprehensive framework to leverage resources for children and advance the agenda for children in the country was made possible.
 
Turning crises into opportunities
The country’s Child Protection System is not ready to respond to any foreseeable abuse of children in the emergency context, whether natural disaster, pandemic or migration. In the absence of the systemic response the heaviest load sits with development partners’ abilities to mobilise funds and the ability of NGOs to provide services. In this situation many children in a situation risky to their health and well-being are not accounted for. This situation urged UNICEF to invest in a contingency plan together with the core state institutions and through mobilisation of non-state actors. The child protection in emergencies mitigation draft plan has been developed with the leadership of the State Agency for Child Right and Protection.
 
Using technology for development 
UNICEF is continuing to work with Akademi.al, the national e-Learning platform, to provide free educational content to 402,849 children in Albania. The website has grown to include 20,127 video lessons in Albanian, of which 1,000 are videos for children with disabilities. The platform, which consists of the latest cloud technologies, and includes interactive features, is moving towards open-source solutions, and has won several awards in 2021 including the following:
Social Impact Fund (Harvard University)
European Young Innovators of World Summit Awards
Europeans Making a Difference (EC)
Start-up of the Year (ICT Awards)
 
In 2020 and 2021, UNICEF supported the University of Tirana, to set up a platform for Social Protection and Services in Albania (www.sociale.al), a virtual space created for academics, decision makers and practitioners of social care services to share information and good practices. Through this platform the capacities of social workers working in the social care field are intended to increase, by improving the university curricula and providing on-the-job training. The platform serves as an updated information source, provides professional support for social workers through online training and supervision, serves as a meeting point for the professional community, promotes good practice in the Albanian context, brings together institutions, service providers and professionals in the public and private sectors of social services, enriches students’ education in social work and connects students to social work practice, provides continuous collaboration between social services and university, and internationalises knowledge and social work practice in Albania through the activity of international organisations in the field.
 
The National Child Helpline ALO 116 was supported with the introduction of the Raporto Tani web-based reporting platform and mobile application in addition to the traditional phone line to allow anonymous forms of reporting cases of violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation while ensuring anonymity and confidentiality, including for children with disabilities.
 
Knowledge management 
Albania CO, with support from UNICEF Europe & Central Asia led the first day of a 5-day Public Finance for Children Sub-regional course for UNICEF staff in the Western Balkans. Participants across all sectors from Albania, Greece, Kosovo, Montenegro and North Macedonia acquired skills, learned how policies are translated into sector plans and budget allocations, and how this relates to outcomes for children. They also learned how to use #PF4C documents for advocacy purposes and to engage with public institutions for financing project for children and young people and effective leveraging and influencing, and create peer support network and acquire knowledge and exchange ideas. This is especially important at this time of fiscal contraction and with spending on children at #risk. The course is adapted for replication in other sub-regions in Europe and Central Asia. 
 
Opportunities
UNICEF Albania responding to one of the key recommendations of the previous Country Programme Evaluation, and developed an office strategy to engage more systematically with the decentralisation processes. In 2021, CO started work to (i) compile a compendium of office practices to document strategies and approaches used on engaging with local and subnational authorities, and (ii) a review of decentralisation processes and intergovernmental arrangements, a mapping of functional assignments in the social sectors affecting children outcomes. The work will be finalised in the first quarter of 2022 and will help CO gain clarity on the situation of (i) local and sub-national mandates, (ii) fiscal and human resources to manage and deliver on those mandates, (iii) scope for local discretion in using resources, and (iv) accountability mechanisms at the local level. The ultimate result is to operationalise the vision put forward in the UNICEF CPD 2022–2027, which is to strengthen partnerships with local and sub-national actors to leverage political will, institutional commitments and resources to contribute to policies and interventions that accelerate and maximise results for children.
 
Negative stereotypes, norms and barriers are considered to be the underlying causes of child deprivations in Albania. In order to strengthen the programmatic response, Albania CO successfully partnered with UNV for a national post on social and behavioural change and will intensify its fundraising efforts. 

"
ECAR,Armenia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"2021 has seen the transition between two Country Programme cycles combined with the humanitarian response to two parallel and in many aspects intertwined crises. This complexity and the evolving needs of children required UNICEF Armenia to adapt its programming approach. From this experience, several lessons learnt and innovative approaches emerged. 
Over the last several years, UNICEF programming in Armenia focused on strengthening national systems for better outcomes for children as often required in middle income country contexts. In implementing the humanitarian response to the double crisis, besides adopting typical emergency-type approaches based on direct service delivery, UNICEF Armenia leveraged the already established expertise and partnerships and supported the adjustment of national systems to address the needs of children facing challenges created by the pandemic and the recent military hostilities. The humanitarian response was therefore largely mainstreamed in the implementation of the overall programme and in some cases merged with development programming. In line with the humanitarian-development nexus’ principle, this innovative approach for the Armenia context enabled an immediate response to urgent humanitarian needs while also building a response through established national systems, thus ensuring greater sustainability and at-scale results.  It also opened a dialogue between UNICEF and national authorities on concrete plans to strengthen the shock-responsiveness of key national systems.  For example, grave socio-economic difficulties faced by children and families in refugee-like situation were addressed through a combination of technical expertise provided to the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs to help adjust its social assistance schemes and direct financial contributions to complement the direct cash support provided to these families. While this approach allowed to efficiently cover the needs, it was also an opportunity to directly observe and identify the system’s gaps, which were in parallel analyzed also through the Core Diagnostic of the social protection system supported by UNICEF and the World Bank. Both initiatives contributed to define sustainable solutions and open a lively multi-sectoral dialogue on how to enhance the shock-responsiveness of the social protection system a
s part of the ongoing reform process of the social protection system which will continue in the coming years. 
The humanitarian response to the double crisis capitalized in creative ways on pre-existing mechanisms earlier established in the country with UNICEF’s support and established new ones.  Adjusting the role and expanding the capacity of parental education centers earlier established with UNICEF’s support in health facilities throughout Armenia helped establish a communication channel on COVID-19 preventive measures with large reach across the country. This facility-based mechanism was complemented by a new outreach mechanism of pediatric mobile units focused on screening and providing consultations to parents and caregivers directly in the communities. These two combined mechanisms have become key channels for widespread and systematic nationwide behavioral change communication that is at the same time tailored to the specific audience’ needs.  Another creative approach was introduced in the education sector based on past experience with organizing services for small groups of children from rural and underserved areas. These services allow students with limited internet connection and/or lack of equipment for distance learning to gather in spaces that comply with COVID-19 preventive measures in their communities and connect for their online classes.
The multiple efforts initiated to promote and enable mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) and alternative family-based care services in the country in response to the double crisis led both government and civil society stakeholders to realize the importance of actively promoting MHPSS and strengthening related services as well as to strengthen the emergency foster care system for children deprived of parental care due to emergencies. Both needs were previously somewhat disregarded and not properly addressed by the social service system. These efforts generated a momentum and opened a window of opportunity to bring MHPSS and emergency foster care on the national agenda. The humanitarian response created a rich experience among civil society and government actors that adopted a wide range of approaches in providing MHPSS, including initiatives specifically tailored to the adolescent age-group. This diverse experience and the lessons learnt drawn from it will serve as basis for the upcoming policy dialogue.
A key lesson learnt relates to the need to continue working even more intensely on strengthening cross-sectoral linkages and promoting coordination mechanisms to address the needs of different categories of vulnerable children in an integrated manner. This is relevant in the case of linking the mental health agenda with the ongoing initiatives to promote psychosocial support also from the child protection and adolescent development perspective as well as for the synergies that need to be promoted to holistically address gender-based violence and violence against children. It also relates to the multi-sectoral aspects of early childhood development including education, development, health and protection aspects. Finally, it remains relevant also for the comprehensive agenda of reforming the social protection system linked with the de-institutionalization process and the process of inclusion of children with disabilities in mainstream schools. In 2022, UNICEF Armenia will continue strengthening its own internal coordination and promoting cross-sectoral coordination mechanisms among relevant stakeholders also in support of national reforms.
Another important lesson learnt relates to the work on behavioral change and social norms. Especially with the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic and the growing need to support national partners in effectively and rapidly communicating key messages to the public, communication for behavioral change has become an increasingly critical programmatic strategy for UNICEF worldwide as well as in Armenia.  To address this need, the new Country Programme includes the establishment of a staff position fully dedicated to this area, which is currently under recruitment and will be on board in early 2022.

ECAR,Azerbaijan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in increased attention and investment in health from both the government and international development partners. The ongoing health system reform provides an excellent opportunity to integrate all high-impact health interventions and services to improve child health and development in Azerbaijan, while challenges in coordination among all institutions in the health sector administration. UNICEF used this opportunity to introduce a set of essential services, including the Iron and Folic Acid (IFA) supplementation for pregnant women and the new universal-progressive model of home visiting in the PHC services, and support to strengthen the role of nurses in delivering maternal and child health services at Primary Health Care (PHC) level. The lack of capacity of health behaviour change is a significant constraint in the country.

UNICEF and MoE are vital partners in the education sector. UNICEF’s long term technical support and policy advocacy successfully brought preschool education and inclusive education into the national education reform agenda. The COVID-19 pandemic was the first time most teachers facilitated distance or digital learning, and in Azerbaijan, many teachers lacked the necessary pedagogical and technical skills to teach effectively. UNICEF's future programming should maintain a focus on digital competencies, online pedagogies, and the development of learners' social and emotional skills. Building solid linkages between the development and emergency programmes remain the core principle in programme implementation in 2021. The Mental Health and Psycho-Social Support was introduced starting from the conflict-affected districts and further expanded to other schools.

During the pandemic virtual engagement and digital advocacy took on special significance. Pushing out messaging on social media or even some public-facing content through emails (e.g. Newsletter for partners) became not just a tool but a key strategy for communication. UNICEF has used widespread smartphones and internet access to design its ECD package and parenting education. The online web portal, social network pages, WhatsApp application and other online platforms were used for ECD communication campaigns and promoting ECD, positive parenting, and access to social services. 

UNICEF successfully reached the most vulnerable children and families affected by the conflict emergency through quality MHPSS, social work services and recreational activities. These services were provided for the first time in the country and received high appreciation by children, families, and local and national government authorities. UNICEF played an active role in promoting cross-sectoral coordination and partnership in delivering emergency services. 

UNICEF worked well in introducing new intervention models into the health and education systems through incorporating the models into pre-service and in-service training systems, which created a better condition for sustainability.

Focusing on gender equality and promoting girls’ access to services were critical considerations in programme management and advocacy with government and NGO/CSO partners. Capacity building of NGO partners in social services also included the concept of maintaining gender equality in service delivery as well as reporting on services with disaggregated data with age, sex, disability status of children. UNICEF also contributed to the advocacy and capacity building of government partners on gender-responsive and gender transformative programming through the UNSDCF platform.

The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the social development and global agenda in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Although the Government is continuously making efforts to support the population, reversed progress is expected, particularly in child immunization and school learning outcomes. In 2022, UNICEF will continue to support the government in addressing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic by supporting the improvement of the primary health care services and education recovery programme. UNICEF will prioritize vulnerable children and their families, particularly children living in the conflict-affected districts and children from IDP families, to prepare their return to the regained territories. 
"
ECAR,Belarus,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Digitalization in Belarus is a key strategic development goal that was tested with the onset of COVID-19.
In 2021 the CO built on 2020 experiences of shifting to online programming modes, creating accelerated digital responses to enhance information outreach and access to services. For example, the CO developed an e-mental health platform to provide adolescents with information on mental health, self-help tips and access to confidential psychological counselling. To expand access to free legal aid, the mobile application, Advokot, was created for children and parents to learn about their rights through games and stories as well as reach lawyers for free consultations through a chat-bot. For adolescent participation and skills development, the U-platform was launched. Finally, with ECARO, the CO participated in developing the parenting application, Bebbo.
While these digital solutions have the potential to amplify opportunities for social inclusion and access to services, creation of the platforms and applications is not sufficient. In development of these devices, the CO learned several lessons that can improve future actions for better outreach and impact.
(1)    Development of technological responses require commitment in budget and ‘uptake’ support from the project inception:
For a platform or application to be effective, the target audiences must first become aware of the tool and start using it regularly, recognising the continuous value in the information or service provided. This factor is particularly true for mobile applications that are easily deleted from devices when not regularly used. As the use of these tools is largely self-motivated, there needs to be a “hook” to keep the interest and uptake.
In the case of Bebbo, the application provides practical parenting information that can be especially useful for new parents. Yet, the materials need to be updated regularly to maintain the audience’s desire to keep coming back to use it. The CO also learned this need with the development of Advokot, where the initial intention was that the application would serve to provide free legal aid to adolescents and their families. As the application was developed, it became clear that having only options for legal aid and some limited legal information would not be sufficient to keep the attention of adolescents to use regularly the application. As a result, the application’s capacities were broadened with different legal information and interactive games.
The content is not the only factor keeping users active, it also needs to be presented in a user-friendly way. Awareness of the application combined with internal and external motivation generated by a promotional campaign may stimulate interest for one to download it, but if the material is hard to understand or to maneuver then there may be significant attrition. Once a user has been dissuaded in the use of the materials, it is unlikely that the person would try again to explore the application. In this case, lack of attention to the content and the usability of materials create the risk of “losing one’s audience group.”
These experiences underscore the need to plan both budgeting and human resources in the beginning of the project to ensure better uptake of the digital tools. With this learning, the CO has made an investment for 2022 to have a dedicated PR company to work with colleagues to promote the developed platforms and applications in a comprehensive and systematic manner.
(2)    Building services together with users to ensure greater response to actual demand:
In designing the platforms and applications, it was important to involve the target audience. For the U-platform and the e-mental health platform, adolescents and young people were consulted from the beginning on the naming and structuring of the platform. In both platforms, adolescents and young people are also active partners in the implementation, with peer counselling designed in the e-MH platform and involvement of adolescents in projects and dialogue on the U-platform. Likewise, the Advokot application was tested by adolescents and young people. These processes better ensured that the digital solutions met the target group’s demands.
The importance of responding to client demand was exhibited in the CO’s Youth-friendly Health Centres’ (YFHC) outreach service, which proved to be a key factor in reaching adolescents including those from vulnerable groups. Specifically, the centres established ‘community spaces’ where adolescents could come to the centres without being obliged to take any actions; they could spend their time as they wanted -- socializing with other peers in the YFHC, familiarizing themselves with services in the centre, or participating in group consultations with specialists. This approach ensured that adolescents, including those potentially ‘at risk,’ felt comfortable enough to be able to come to the centre and be in a safe environment where they can decide when, or if, they are prepared to participate in services. At the same time, motivational consultations with outreach workers were available. Assessment of the integration of the outreach service revealed that YFHCs’ coverage of adolescents and young people doubled.
Strengthening evidence-based social behaviour change communication is critical for 2022. Simply providing target audiences with information or offering tools that are practical, but inconvenient, does not result in behaviour change or shifts in social norms. A focus on effectively identifying underlying key drivers of relevant behaviours, as well as psychological, socio-cultural or environmental bottlenecks influencing them, before designing tools and interventions is needed. Monitoring changes in sentiments and progress towards results with rapid assessments and social listening is also a priority. 
To better match client demand with existing services, the CO in 2022 will collaborate with the ECAR Office and other Country Offices to explore how to use technology to identify target groups’ information and service needs to ensure more appropriate responses."
ECAR,Bosnia and Herzegovina,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Building back better: reimagining education, health and protection for future
As BiH continued to go through multiple challenges, including the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, the crisis has been also a real opportunity to strengthen the system in the education, health and protection sectors. 
 
COVID-19 has exposed many deficiencies in the health sector in BiH, among them a poor level of digitalization of data on immunization and poor quality of cold chain. To build back better, UNICEF with partners has started the advancement of electronic health records on immunization in order to have more accurate, up-to-date real-time data to strengthen vaccination programmes and has been upgrading the 100% of the cold chain equipment in BiH for routine and COVID-19 vaccination. 
 
COVID-19 exposed gaps in MHPSS service provision, and UNICEF used this opportunity to strengthen protection systems through capacity-building of over 200 professionals from the CSW, Centers for Mental Health (CMH) and education professionals in MHPSS. Professionals were trained and certified to provide virtual and telephone MHPSS; in addition, the capacity of Blue Phone service providers to deliver quality, accessible protection services increased.
 
To improve quality of learning for children in BiH, UNICEF supported the counterparts to ‘build back better and equally’ through developing the BiH technical standards that will enable stakeholders to provide optimum ICT equipment for schools throughout the country, capacity building of 1,521 teachers on digital/blended education and speeding up digital transformation in education through providing digital devices for children. 
 
Also, UNICEF invested in enhancing the nexus between the humanitarian and development programme, which resulted in achieving good progress in ensuring the rights of children on the move. Thanks to UNICEF advocacy, education authorities have demonstrated commitment to include children on the move in mainstream education. In particular, the Ministry of Education in Canton Sarajevo designated two local schools to host children on the move and develop and provide adapted preparatory programmes for these children. However, the authorities still rely on assistance from international actors, so further investments are required. 
Digital First Programming:
Due to continuing COVID-19 restrictions, digital first programming became the new normal as the majority of activities were conducted online, allowing a broader group of participants and significantly reducing costs. However, with widespread online fatigue, it was also challenging to maintain high participation in e-workshops. To overcome this, UNICEF BiH and its partners invested in applying a participatory approach and creating engaging content: these efforts resulted in an overall participation rate of 93.3 per cent during UPSHIFT workshops for young people. 
Rolling out real-time monitoring of the education sector:
The COVID-19 pandemic induced an abrupt shift to e-learning and blended learning, causing government partners to be more open to innovations, particularly in EdTech. UNICEF supported the selected locations in developing the methodology for real-time monitoring in education, enabling authorities to gather important information focusing on students’ and teachers’ situations with regards to availability of devices, internet speed, and self-assessment in the quality of delivery of e-learning and blended learning. By the end of the year, over 3,000 responses were received within a week to inform education interventions, also focusing on ability to reach the most vulnerable children. 
Improving access to education for children with disabilities:
As the education system continued to face COVID-19 challenges, the most vulnerable children were the most affected. To address the needs of children with disabilities, UNICEF BiH brokered a partnership with the world leading AT provider, Tobii Dynavox, to improve teachers’ inclusive education practices and their English language skills in the context of blended and e-teaching in RS and the Sarajevo Canton. Moreover, UNICEF supported education authorities’ capacity on assistive technology by preparing a new, well-researched catalogue of AT equipment available on the market. 
 
Innovative communication approaches to address children’s challenges
To motivate more people to use Blue Phone’s child protection services(providing remote case management and telephone support), UNICEF and its partner Nova Generacija conducted a successful campaign using social networks and Google Ads. With this approach, 35,000 people were attracted to the Blue Phone website, which offers the possibility of anonymous chat counselling. In addition, through collaboration with a prominent YouTuber who created the series ‘Scary Stories’ (over 200,000 views) covering domestic and peer violence as well as online bullying, viewers were introduced to the work of Blue Phone leading to increased calls and views. 
By mainstreaming preschool education activities in children's TV content, UNICEF was able to ensure broad outreach to children, especially those living in remote areas, considering falling preschool education enrolment rates during the last two pandemic years. To address the educational gap for preschool children – the biggest out-of-school group during the lockdown – UNICEF produced new edutainment episodes with a focus on early learning, social and emotional development, broadcasted by several TV stations.
To amplify nutrition messages, UNICEF produced a TV cooking show with one of the most popular chefs in the country. Following edutainment principles, the show offered practical advice on preparing healthy meals for children and promoted household activities as a positive parenting tool, involving child guests and nutritionists. The show included ambassadors from few countries and heads of international partner organizations, informing them about UNICEF’s nutrition programmes and leaving the space for future collaboration.  
Strengthening social protection of the most vulnerable families and children
 
Due to fiscal ecosystems constrained by COVID-19, positioning social needs as a priority for investment and not a cost continues to be a challenge. To address it, UNICEF supported positioning the social protection sector in two non-traditional domains: social entrepreneurship and integrated case management, in close coordination with employment sector in BiH. The efforts in ten locations are expected to contribute to a shift in activating the social protection system to stimulate work integration and employability in the most vulnerable categories and ensure more vulnerability-focused COVID-19 recovery measures.

ECAR,Bulgaria,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The implementation of the ECG pilot project has been critical for the strategic positioning of UNICEF as a leader in child poverty reduction and a trusted partner to the Government. The establishment of the Steering Committees under the leadership of Ministry of Labor and Social Policy, district and local authorities has contributed to building ownership and commitment. The Steering Committees   have provided a forum for dialogue, raising awareness, and improving the understanding of the objectives and key mechanisms of the Child Guarantee and have facilitated institutional cooperation and networking. In this respect, the role of UNICEF has been critical not only as an expert, facilitator, and convenor but also in the agenda-setting and steering the discussions. The political instability in the country, which started after the general elections in April, did not affect the implementation of the pilot project in 2021 as the key ministers and deputy ministers from the caretaker Government confirmed that commitment to the Child Guarantee and were actively engaged. The good progress of the ECG Pilot strengthened the partnership with the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy and ensured UNICEF technical advisory role in drafting the National Plan of Action on EU Child Guarantee. This is an important opportunity for leveraging of long-term funding for children and will be key focus of work in 2022.
Implementation of the EU CG Pilot Project enabled the convergence of several UNICEF supported models at the local level. Using this opportunity, UNICEF raised the issue of sustainability of models and related services, their integration in the child related systems and budgets and gradual hand-over to the Government. This will be focus of 2022 work and reflected in the National Plan of Action on EU Child Guarantee.
One of the good examples of factoring in the sustainability and the Government ownership from the very early stages of the intervention is development of the online platform podkrepime.mon.bg. This is the country's first inclusive digital education platform which will provide adapted educational resources for the specific needs of every child and unite under one virtual roof specialists, teachers, parents, and children. The Ministry of Education and Science co-managed development of the platform and will be responsible for its maintenance.
In addition to the office need to shift the focus of work from the modeling towards more upstream technical work and bolder advocacy, there is a need for a bolder advocacy and capacity building in terms of child rights safeguard as   progress and achievements are highly dependent on political will and contextual factors, over which UNICEF Bulgaria has limited to no control. These points were supported by the preliminary finding of the current CP Evaluation (2018 -2022).
The office carried out two integrated (fundraising and advocacy campaigns) – the one called “ CyberSurvivor “ did not bring expected results in terms of funds which lead to a conclusion that the audience is still not sensitized about the importance of  developing digital  and critical thinking skills for youth and adolescent to be able to detect fake news  and other on line risks . Despite a good awareness raising effect of the campaign, the office did not obtain return of investment. In this regard, only one integrated campaign will be implemented in order to consolidate all efforts in the office, test a topic and prepare a robust fundraising action plan. 
 
The country office scaled up U-Report in the country and used it for national consultations with young people on important topics, including the EU Child Guarantee.  More than 250,000 people were   reached via social media, seven leading youth organizations were engaged to co-create polls and articles, and the platform was also presented during key youth events. As a result, nearly 1500 young people in the country are active U-Reporters. U-Report Bulgaria also has a global Youth Champion who is now a member of the European Commission’s first Youth Sounding Board. A Youth Advisory Board is being created at the CO and one of its major roles is to further mainstream U-Report, including with institutions nationally and internationally, especially during the 2022, EU Year of Youth and the ongoing dialogue on the Future of Europe. 
The political instability in the country, resulted with the late submission of the Resilience and Recovery Plan (RRP) to the European Commission. The Bulgarian plan is structured around four pillars: Innovative Bulgaria, Green Bulgaria, Connected Bulgaria, and Fair Bulgaria. The plan includes measures in areas such as decarbonization of the economy, education and skills, research and innovation, smart industry, energy efficiency, sustainable agriculture, digital connectivity, social inclusion, and healthcare. The RRP covers important areas for children such as education and skills, and social inclusion. However, there should be a stronger focus on vulnerable groups of children and UNICEF will focus in 2022 on closer monitoring of the plan and proactively look for opportunities to further engage and leverage funding for children.
 
As co-chair of the ‘Group of Friends of Children and the SDGs’ and member of the UN Human Rights Council, Bulgaria continued to actively advocate and promote child rights at regional and global levels. In December 2021, Bulgaria together with the other two co-chairs Jamaica and Luxembourg, organized the first-of-its-kind High-level meeting of the Group of Friends as part of the inaugural Global Forum on Children and Youth (CY21).  The session entitled ""From Global Champions to Local Action"" brought together Heads of Governments, Ministers, as well as child/youth advocates to discuss some of the most pressing issues for children in the 21st century.  
While advocacy on Child Rights in Bulgaria itself has been challenging in 2021 due to the political context, Bulgaria plays a strong advocacy role at the global context.

ECAR,Croatia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"As a result of the long-term partnership with the Zagreb Stock Exchange and dedicated advocacy efforts on positioning children’s rights and relevant topics in the financial sector, UNICEF provided support to the Croatian Financial Services Supervisory Agency in the integration of children’s rights and family-friendly indicators into the first Guidelines for the Preparation and Disclosure of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Relevant Issues in the country. The Guidelines will help companies in the process of ESG reporting in Croatia and will have long term impact on companies’ reporting and awareness about children’s rights. It is an excellent example of promoting regulatory policies addressing how companies operate and report on practices, which leads to greater awareness on business impact on children’s rights. The partnership with Central State Office for Demography and Youth contributed to the promotion of family-friendly policies in the business community. It showcased how UNICEF can influence and inform policy in a high-income country to design and propose an appropriate course of action to help the business community advance their impact on employees and their children and families. Establishing a sectoral approach in the adoption of Child Rights and Business important issues positioned UNICEF as a relevant and authoritative partner and provider of expertise to the business community.
Independent multi-country evaluation of the UNICEF ECD response to COVID-19 (2021) has found that the hybrid re-assessment of baby-friendly standards carried out by UNICEF can be considered the most innovative out of all of the adaptations supported by UNICEF in Croatia. The hybrid assessment was among the first such assessments in the world. Encouraged by Croatia’s example, other countries in the region already adopted the solution. In addition to being used for future emergencies, some of the solutions introduced by UNICEF in response to COVID-19 can also be used to provide information or services for harder-to-reach populations in general in the future.
In all UNICEF research, analytical and evaluation processes, including the development of the Situation Analysis on Children and Adolescents in Croatia, the CO engaged adolescents and young people that acted not only in the capacity of key informants but also as co-creators of joint programmes of UNICEF and Government of Croatia including the new country programme of cooperation. This practice enables children's and young people's voices to be consistently heard ensuring their meaningful participation. One of the latest examples refers to the formative Evaluation of the Family-Based Care Component where young people raised in foster families and who also participated in focus group discussions during the evaluation, were informed about evaluation findings and had the opportunity to contribute to developing the relevant evaluation management response plan. Suggestions from young people were instrumental in influencing the social sector’s measures for young people leaving public care. They highly appreciated the opportunity to channel their insights in the implementation of evaluation recommendations and have the chance to shape public policies and programmes for children in public care. As children said, they also felt respected and empowered by this experience. 

"
ECAR,"ECARO, Switzerland",Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The COVID-19 pandemic continued to be a challenge during 2021 and provided additional lessons learned, particularly in the delivery of services (health and nutrition, child protection, education, youth and adolescents). 
Initiation of vaccination was challenged by limited supplies and a politized process, placing additional burden on Country Offices and requiring extended coordination and communication with Supply Division. COVID-19 has also increased challenges around routine health practices and services, especially ensuring infants and young children have access to nutritious and healthy food. In response, ECARO developed a digital platform to enable parents, caregivers, and other active community members to share their real-time experiences of being targeted by aggressive advertising of breast-milk substitutes (BMS). The Baby Feeding Code Square (BFCS) supports parents and users to familiarise themselves with the major features of the national and international code of marketing of BMS and their rights to offer optimum IYCF to their new-borns. The BFCS will be launched in 2022 with a phased approach in priority countries in the region.
The pandemic, and related educational obstacles, highlighted inequality in education systems, particularly challenges in collecting data of marginalized children. In addition, the important of inter-sectoral coordination and the provision of a safe and healthy learning environment were emphasized during the year. ECARO will continue to advocate and engage multiple sectors and stakeholders to address learning needs of disadvantaged children. Given the restructured learning and teaching in many countries following the pandemic, ECARO will support the process of revising long-term education strategies and plans to meet evolving needs of children and societies.
The COVID-19 crisis had a disproportionate impact on youth and showed the importance of engaging them systematically in issues affecting their lives. Governments and multilateral partners recognized the need to take action to support and provide opportunities to youth to prevent the risk of a “lost generation” resulting from COVID-19. This commitment pushed the EU to declare 2022 as European Year of Youth. This provides UNICEF with critical opportunities to strengthen focus on youth programming and engagement and use the European Youth as a platform to develop longer-term and more visible youth programming, especially in areas of mental health and wellbeing, greening and climate change, social inclusion, education and learning, employment and entrepreneurship, youth mobility and protection. 
COVID also increased recognition of innovative “digital solutions” and their potential to respond to challenges in health, education, employment, communication, social norms, etc. UNICEF’s focus on developing digital MHPSS solutions is an important and practical way to help reduce gaps between the needs for MHPSS support/services and access to those services by young people. Digital platforms, if developed carefully, co-created with youth and with attention to existing scientific evidence, can help decrease gaps between service needs and access. This can increase effective MHPSS support for mild-to-moderate conditions through digital and/or blended approaches.  Building capacities of governments to work with youth, recognize their agency and involve them in co-creating and co-designing systems and services that respond to their needs will be essential.   
Building on previous experience, the Partnerships and Planning Teams jointly developed a methodology to ensure that strategic interventions involving business stakeholders were integrated into CPD development, in line with the Business for Results approach, and conducted workshops with relevant Country Offices. Additionally, a strategic document on the relevance of business to different Programme areas and potential key interventions was developed jointly with ECARO Regional Advisers to serve as a key tool for COs. One highlight during the year was the support provided to the Croatia CO to insert specific references to children's rights and family-friendly policies within financial reporting regulations in the country. This will have a long-term impact on business awareness, practices, and reporting related to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG), showing the potential for further engagement in advocacy related to business regulation.
The new data collection template of TransMonEE indicated severe gaps in the availability and disaggregation of data for child protection indicators for many countries. ECARO launched data action planning and systems, in close collaboration with headquarters, to support governments in the region with short and long-term plans to improve administrative data on child protection and enhance the understanding of the broader data landscape for children.  
Despite capacity challenges, ECARO Communications strengthened its digital advocacy approach, tailored global assets for regional use, and provided Russian translation for more than 140 different communication assets, facilitating the exchange of country-produced contents between offices with shared language and media space.
Social and Behavioural Change (SBC) communication learned several lessons during the year including the importance of strengthened coordination mechanisms and evidence generation to develop targeted interventions and amplify reach. This was particularly relevant in the vaccination rollout process regarding national perceptions and vaccine hesitancy. 
In terms of internal management, the transition to DHR leadership, competing organisational initiatives, and restrictions in accessing data, created bottlenecks in the implementation of Geneva-level HR activities. On a positive note, COVID-19 led to increase desire and willingness for teams to bond, discuss, and review ways of engagement. HR and wellbeing functions seized these opportunities to support change management in offices and engage on diversity and inclusion.

ECAR,Georgia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons learned:

· UNICEF continued to work with all stakeholders, regardless of political or religious affiliation. As a trusted and impartial partner, UNICEF was able to move forward with planned municipal activities, despite a polarized political environment. 
· Interagency cooperation is a challenge and, therefore, involvement of high-level coordination mechanisms – the Inter-agency Commission on the Implementation of the CRC - helped to facilitate discussions and activation of stakeholders. Moreover, focus on the best interests of the child as the heart of discussions allowed diverse stakeholders to unite around a common agenda, opening new pathways to bring various stakeholders together to engage on human and child rights. 
· Consistent, evidence-based messaging is an important aspect to translating advocacy into action. 
· Evidence was used to support more targeting and tailored interventions for priority and vulnerable groups including teachers and healthcare workers.
· Low COVID-19 vaccination amongst healthcare workers mirrors the hesitancy in routine vaccination. Targeted interventions to address the concerns of healthcare workers will be prioritized so they can become agents of change.    
· While large household surveys, which involve data collection in the field, are expensive and more challenging to implement, telephone-based surveys can also generate some similar data, allowing for faster generation of information about the real-time situation of households, in a more cost-effective manner, noting that this does not replace the need of household surveys. 
· Model and pilot programmes generate important evidence and demonstrate the effectiveness of interventions, thus playing a significant role in translating advocacy into action.
· Engaging with influential stakeholders including religious and community leaders and other prominent figures, such as doctors and teachers, is a critical component in generating social change. 
· Engagement of diverse stakeholders in the creation of communications content proved to be effective in engaging targeted groups of people with specific messaging. 
· Ad-hoc consultations with partners allowed for fast coordination around specific topics. This reduced risks of duplication of efforts while at the same time addressing the issue of misaligned timing of coordination meetings to discuss issues as they arise, thereby improving efficiency and effectiveness. 
· UNICEF continues to apply adapted work modalities within a nexus of flexibility, trust and accountability, allowing staff to continue to perform and achieve results in an effective and efficient manner despite the challenges posed by COVID-19. 
 
Innovations: 
 
· The establishment of the Permanent Parliamentary Council on Child Rights Protection represents a major change in how child rights will be monitored in Georgia, and enhances the child rights agenda in the Parliament. 
· UNICEF continues to prioritize digital transformation to facilitate the continuity of essential services, including expanded telemedicine to improve access to maternal and child health services as well as digitalization of textbooks for lower secondary level students and digitalized trainings of early childhood education practices. 
· Child Rights Centres are an innovative mechanism to build a child rights culture and rights-based education. These Centres support delivery of professional development programmes, promote inclusiveness and quality of education, empower communities to become better child rights advocates and provide educational services to disadvantaged children, students, academic staff, teachers and parents. The Centres will also be linked to the Parliament and the Executive Branch to provide reliable and unbiased evidence on child rights and children’s issues. 
· Innovations in data collection, including a move from field-based to telephone-based household surveys, expanded the ability to collect frequent, real-time data, albeit at a smaller scale, allowing for faster generation of information on the situation for families. In addition, using new methods to examine multiple child deprivations in the Welfare Monitoring Survey and the needs of children with disabilities will better inform needed social protection measures. A few UNICEF Country Offices (Belarus, Liberia) expressed interest to conduct similar studies and asked for experiences to be shared.
· Creation child-friendly information portals expands access to critical information and services. For instance, the Legal Aid Service website for children, including children with disabilities, will increase children’s access to legal defense and justice.

ECAR,Greece,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
One of the major impediments to full implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in Greece are insufficient budgetary allocations, coupled with inadequate monitoring mechanisms. In addition, there are multiple inter-related challenges affecting children in the country including persisting social and cultural norms and practices that ultimately inhibit access to and utilisation of services, the quality and relevance of public services that relate to children, and the overall below-average level of investment in those services. 
 
Based on the GCO’s experiences during 2021, the future effectiveness of UNICEF programmes in Greece will be centered around shaping the new vision for the Country Programme, in close consultation with all related actors and will be supported by the ongoing change management process, restructuring and capacity building of the programme team to be able to respond to the new identified areas of work, while continuing the GCO work with refugee and migrant children. These efforts will be further supported by an integrated approach to planning through alignment of advocacy, fundraising and programme priorities. 
 
In particular, efforts to take forward GCO's objectives in evidence generation and child protection mainstreaming, which included following open calls addressed to CSOs and academia, revealed a limited local capacity and experience in research on child rights and in work on mainstream child protection, resulting in an increased need for support by UNICEF.  
 
The implementation of the pilot project of Child Guarantee in Greece has proven to be a great opportunity to support government efforts on DI and the expansion of alternative community-based care models. However, it has also been challenging in terms of the institutional mindset of the latter and a reluctance to large scale reform. Linear implementation seems difficult when public authorities are ultimately accountable often resulting in significant delays. It is, therefore, critical to be flexible, to achieve smaller-scale change, which albeit slow, can be more effective than attempting systematic reform all at once. 
 
In spite of the challenges to establish and set up systems, tools and procedures of a new CO while operating in teleworking modality, UNICEF Greece CO successfully implemented a $28 million dollar programme including emergency programming. However, limited financial resources impact the ability of the office to adjust its structure to be sufficiently fit for purpose.  
 
The first knowledge management strategy of the Greece Country Office was established with a two-year timeframe. A total of 11 actions aim to strengthen the exchange of information and knowledge internally, with an additional four actions engaging an external audience. 
 
The ongoing effects of COVID-19 continue to impact the GCO at all levels and throughout the office structure. The prolonged locked down early in the year, administrative procedures imposed by the state and the subsequent operational environment resulted in unexpected delays that influenced the programming context and funds mobilization. Staff induction and assimilation process was highly challenging with teleworking modalities remaining the normal through most of the year. The refugee and migrant population were particularly affected by COVID-19 restrictions and UNICEF through its implementing partners continued to make use of remote modalities and digital technology to reach children and families in need.  
 
The launch of the private sector business and corporate partnerships of the GCO and introductory discussions with potential donors revealed the need for sustained long-term engagement in order to realize results. In line with the UNICEF Business for Results (B4R) approach, the GCO needs to shift its perception of the private sector from solely financial contributors to shared value partnerships that will deliver even greater results for children. In Greece, the business sector has a granular grasp of the context with country-specific scientific and policy expertise as well as access to in-country resources and key players which make it an invaluable resource for the CO.  
 
In addition, a more systematic effort is required to communicate UNICEF’s mandate in Greece. The GCO can use the private sector and big corporates to codesign communication campaigns that would raise brand awareness on the one hand but also convey key messages to the public around the shifting the agenda for children in Greece.

ECAR,Kazakhstan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"While vaccine hesitancy is often attributed solely to those members of the population who are anti-vaccination, in Kazakhstan the work that UNICEF has undertaken with partners has demonstrated that it is a more nuanced, complex issue. The issue has also been highlighted by the rate of vaccine hesitancy significantly increasing in Kazakhstan due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
The root cause analysis of the vaccine preventable measles outbreak that UNICEF conducted identified that vaccine hesitancy encompasses a spectrum of issues and clearly indicates: 1) a lack of efficient communication between different stakeholders; 2) lack of knowledge among healthcare workers; and 3) important gaps in the immunization system. These are addressed through UNICEF’s immunization strengthening programme. The rate of vaccine hesitancy significantly increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic, though evidence clearly indicates that vaccine hesitancy encompasses a spectrum of issues that includes the existence of militant anti-vaxxers, parents with genuine questions and concerns that they cannot find answers to, misinformation, lack of access to PHC services, and lack of trust in the healthcare system regarding delivery, storage of vaccines and side effects. Despite that, healthcare workers remain the main and respected source of information.
 
UNICEF and partners responded to these reasons for vaccine hesitancy, including a lack of easily obtainable information on the immunization programme, through a multifaceted strategy that included developing a one-stop information shop online, the egu.kz website, where parents can find answers to their well-founded questions about vaccination and the immunization system, and long-reads in vlast.kz, volunteering, and training of health workers. 
 
Also, to address gaps in evidence, UNICEF conducted a KAP survey on immunization among parents and healthcare workers, an assessment of the vaccine procurement and supply system, assessments of medical contraindication and the registration of adverse events following immunization. The findings were used to lower vaccine hesitancy through C4D activities and improve vaccination planning, procurement, distribution, and administration. 
 
In generating evidence for programming and advocacy, UNICEF has invested substantially in the evaluation of systems such as social protection and VAC. However, it has become clear that it did not invest sufficiently in the ownership of these evaluations. As a result, there have been instances when, following the conducting of an evaluation, the counterpart has not been in agreement with the findings though it was in full agreement with the evaluation being conducted. This has led not only to difficulties in the utilisation of the results of the evaluation but also put strain on the partnership. In future, additional focus at the start of the process of designing evaluations needs to be placed on ensuring buy-in by all partners involved in all aspects of the evaluation including the possibility that the results/findings may not be as expected.
 
Primary and secondary schools opened for face-to-face learning on 1 September after COVID-19 restrictions were lifted. The schools were totally closed for nine weeks, and partially closed for over 34 weeks (with some variation according to the school location). This inevitably led to learning loss and considerable school dropout. The pandemic brought into focus the importance of children being able to study and learn online as well as in schools. With over 90 per cent of students reverting to distance learning during quarantine, to sustain the continuity of learning digital technology and good internet connectivity are essential.
 
UNICEF has therefore promoted school connectivity by connecting schools to the internet, providing content for teachers in delivering digital blended learning, and the development of digital public goods (DPG). Inter alia, this enables the fostering of language literacy online and specifically the implementation of the Akelius language initiative for children affected by migration and returning from conflict zones.
 
At the same time, after joining the Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA) in 2020, Kazakhstan is revising the Digital Kazakhstan state programme into a new DigitEl project to boost digital development, connectivity and building digital skills among the population. UNICEF conducted a DPG needs assessment with the participation of the government, quasi-government organizations, NGOs and startups, which identified existing solutions or those to be developed as DPG. A series of DPG webinars, conducted by UNICEF and Astana Hub for Kazakhstan’s start-up community, improved their understanding and knowledge of DPG and accessibility standards. A DPG component was subsequently included by Astana Hub in their acceleration programme, and three digital platforms (Okulab.kz; Doskaz.kz; okoo.kz) were aligned to DPGA international standards to meet the needs of children with visual and hearing impairments. Digital Public Good – Accessible Kazakhstan (https://doskaz.kz/en) was recognized by the global DPGA. 
 
The development of cloud technologies will provide many opportunities for building integrated online platforms to assist in learning, adapting textbooks into digital format, and deliver online lessons, digital skills from primary to tertiary level students. A key direction for transforming the approaches to the provision of services and interaction of the state with citizens and business will be the transition to the principles of open architecture, in which a qualitatively new level of cooperation with the commercial sector will be built. As a result of UNICEF’s work on the promotion and scaling-up of DPG, DigitEL’s main principle for creation of new digital solutions is in the use of open information storage technologies (open-source). 

"
ECAR,Kosovo (UN SC resolution 1244),Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The continued challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 resulted in the adaptation of working and delivery practices, providing new opportunities and paving the way for new approaches. UNICEF’s fast support in response to the school closures and learning disruptions has contributed to the creation of digital solutions for children, as a first step towards the digitization of education. The ECD digital platform and shkollat.org, with the Learning Platform technology integrated to it, provide distance and blended learning opportunities for young children and compulsory school-age children and adolescents. These platforms have the potential to contribute to better education processes and outcomes, by developing teachers’ digital skills and understanding of blended learning pedagogy, by providing additional educational opportunities for children and adolescents, and by improving the content of education delivery at home and in preschool settings, particularly in the case of the ECD platform. Obstacles to distance learning during the pandemic included lack of infrastructure and low teacher capacities, which impeded optimal use of the digital solutions developed. UNICEF has learned the importance of bridging these gaps by combining partnership development for devices and connectivity with local level partnerships with municipal authorities, schools, teachers and parents for supporting take-up and use. To this end, the need for a strategic approach to education digitalization has been a critical lesson learned and UNICEF is now supporting the MESTI to shape the digitalization of education pillar of the new Kosovo Education Sector Strategy, currently under development.  
Similarly, the adoption of teleconsultation for the UPHV programme enabled the programme to reach more pregnant women and children aged 0-3 and resulted in increased frequency of communication and interaction between nurses and parents. Given the need to find cost-effective and sustainable ways for the programme to meet its performance standards, when used in complement to traditional in-person home visits this approach offers great potential for the future of the UPHV implementation beyond the pandemic.
Programme implementation this year also highlighted several lessons related to partnerships for children and adolescents. Bridging the school to work transition gap requires extended and non-traditional partnerships with a range of public and private organizations, businesses, and umbrella organizations. Encouraging results from 2021, with 24% of young interns employed following their internship, demonstrate that building a wide movement for work experience can be a successful strategy to support the employment of young people, including from marginalized groups. 
In a volatile political context, frequent government changes have been associated with priority shifts, which pose a risk for the implementation of programmes and policies at scale and that require national financial and political support to be successful. UNICEF has learned that ensuring the continuity of political priorities across governments requires a long-term strategic engagement with the institutions, and technical staff, and other stakeholders. Joint advocacy with civil society has also proven instrumental to ensure continuity of the legal framework development process across governments and to maintain key issues on the national agenda, such as child protection or the rights of children living with disabilities. 
In the context of programme implementation, the use of an open call for expression of interest by CSOs, academic and research institutions proved to be critical to expand UNICEF’s partnerships and diversify the implementing partners for the Kosovo Programme (2021-2025). 
The support to the planning and evaluation process of the NDS (2016-2021) revealed that the first national-led youth accompanied evaluation of the Human Capital Pillar of the NDS contributed to instilling a culture of evaluation at national level. Combining the evaluation exercise with capacity building on Results Based Management and evaluation principles sparked interest across institutions and line ministries, for a more integrated planning, monitoring and evaluation process of strategies and policies. 
The engagement of young people in the NDS evaluation process, the organization of youth consultations to inform the development of the new NDS (2022-2030) were recognized as meaningful by the SPO/OPM, that could pave the way for the replication of such activities for future legal, policy development and national decision-making processes. 
The benefits to data collection using a blended approach that combines in-person and virtual interviews and focus groups are many. A blended approach enables reaching out to more key informants, ensuring geographical representativeness and participant diversity, and keeping costs low. UNICEF has learned valuable lessons on how to secure, maximize and facilitate remote participation of key informants which will be used in future evaluation and research exercises. 
Furthermore, engaging key institutions in data collection and analysis activities is not only meaningful for producing useful evidence and information to inform policy decision-making processes, but also instrumental in pointing to the gaps in existing data systems and data collection and reporting processes. The data collection process led by the KAS for the TransMonEE regional initiative revealed the lack of flexibility or the incompleteness of existing data systems that hinders their ability to generate a wide range of information. Valuable lessons were drawn from the exercise, resulting in the identification of key priorities for data quality improvement and new entry points for strengthening further the administrative data collection and reporting processes.
Lastly, programme implementation in 2021 demonstrated the importance of effective and efficient management for achieving planned results which was further strengthened through responsive, transparent, and accountable internal governance, and the development of a results-oriented, efficient and effective management culture. For instance, simplifying processes by using the E-Tools platform, including the pilot of electronic Programme Documents, increased office efficiency and effectiveness by streamlining the field activities monitoring and reporting. A key lesson learned is the importance of continuous capacity development for national and local Implementing Partners, civil society organizations and UNICEF staff for UNICEF’s on financial and risk management procedures and processes. The office will continue its focus on risk management through enhanced oversight and assessment, such as building the capacity of Implementing Partners and further leveraging E-tools for the management of the Harmonized Approach to Cash Transfers (HACT).

ECAR,Moldova,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Agile programming in the context of the pandemic
 
Having made considerable adjustments to the Country Programme as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Moldova CO continued to adapt to the everchanging circumstances on the ground. While most of the support to the country’s management of the pandemic in 2020 was around infection prevention and control, as well as supporting the secondary impact of the pandemic by ensuring the continuity of essential services in health, education, child protection and others, this year the CO spent considerable human, technical and financial resources on supporting the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine procurement, distribution, storage and delivery, as well as communication and outreach activities to encourage vaccine uptake.  

The lessons learned from last year related to teleworking and managing partnerships and programmes remotely were extremely valuable and enabled the CO to refocus its attention and quickly adjust its activities to include the much needed vaccination support. Working closely with WHO and the Ministry of Health, UNICEF supported the development and implementation of the National Vaccine Deployment Plan and the accompanying Communication Strategy. Being part of the national coordination teams responsible for implementing both was invaluable. It helped the country secure more than 2 million vaccination doses and vaccinate more than one million people. 
 
 
Intensifying Youth engagement
A number of initiatives were implemented to ensure a more comprehensive, consistent and impactful youth engagement. These activities were informed by the lessons learned from our engagement with youth over the past years, and used tools and approaches that proved effective in the country and elsewhere. This included a more strategic use of social media for two-way communication with youth, strengthened real-time data collection, engagement with youth organizations and others. 

For the first time, UNICEF, in partnership with UNFPA helped establish a UN Adolescents and Youth Advisory Panel (AYAP). The role of the 10, openly and transparently selected AYAP members is to advise the UN agencies on all aspects of their work, from planning, to programming and implementation, reporting, advocacy and others. AYAP became functional in the fall of 2021, and has already made an impact on our work, participating in advocacy campaign, planning the new UNSDCF, and others. 

Youth engagement through social media was significantly scaled up. U-Report was used to not only collect real-time views and opinions of youth, but to also share messages and information with youth to support our efforts to address bullying, violence, COVID-19 and others. Facebook was used as a platform to engage youth in real time by organizing live talk shows to inform and engage youth and adolescents on a variety of topics related to the pandemic, but also on violence, mental health and others. In partnership with VIBER, UNICEF reached youth with messages on anti-bullying and kindness as part of its national campaign. 
Lastly, through the innovative UPSHIFT programme implemented in two regions, Cahul and Ungheni, 500 adolescents from 25 schools (14 Ungheni, 11 Cahul) were trained on community problems identification, reporting, preventing and addressing all forms of violence, and 7 social innovation programmes were selected for implementation to contribute to creating violence-free communities, with a special focus on women and girls. 
 
 
How to programme more effectively – lessons from the Country Programme Evaluation and the Gender Programmatic Review
 
With the support from ECARO, UNICEF Moldova benefited from an evaluation of its Country Programme of Co-operation between the Government of the Republic of Moldova and UNICEF 2018-2022 (hereinafter: CPE). The evaluation’s purpose is to strengthen accountability of UNICEF to national stakeholders by evaluating UNICEF’s contribution to the results for children at scale especially for the most vulnerable. The CPE evaluated the programme relevance, coherence and impact, and provided some valuable lessons learned that are currently being considered in developing the next CPD 2023-27. 

One of the most relevant findings of the CPE was that UNICEF’s efforts over the programme cycle focused on developing and strengthening the legal frameworks and policies addressing the legal bottlenecks that impede the realization of child rights. The findings revealed that a lot of the identified gaps that remain are related to institutional capacities and capacity gaps, hence the UNICEF focus should shift to these. 

Another recommendation from the CPE was to invest additional efforts in increasing public spending on key child rights priority areas by improving budget planning and political advocacy. Insufficient budget allocations for plans and commitments for children are a major impediment that needs to be addressed in all aspects of the programme  from the very beginning of implementation of activities, as it was done successfully within the Youth Friendly Health Services programme. 

A third finding and a recommendation from the CPE is related to the need to ensure programming is targeted at the right level, either central or subnational. The latter is especially important to affect real change in the lives of children, but it is frequently plagued by a lack of knowledge, capacity or resources. It is therefore imperative for programming to ensure local authorities and stakeholders are provided with information on the benefits of decentralization, and to strengthen their capacities to provide inclusive and quality care for children. 

Similarly, with ECARO’s support the CO benefitted from a Gender Programmatic Review (GPR), assessing potential entry points for gender mainstreaming and priority areas for investment in the next programme cycle. The GPR provided invaluable sector-specific and general recommendations, such as expanding existing programmes with the potential to achieve gender transformative results, mainstream gender evenly in all programme outputs, enhance the gender lens of specific interventions, and others. 
 
All recommendations from the CPE and the GPR were already considered for the remaining period of the current CPD 2018-2022, and reflected in the planning for the next CPD.

ECAR,North Macedonia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"By building on the partnerships and results of the Eduino initiative UNICEF supported the creation of the first innovative national platform for digital interactive textbooks. Titled E-Library, the platform is part of the continuous expansion and upgrade of the Eduino initiative and currently offers digital interactive textbooks for 4th grade students in 5 local languages. To address the digital divide especially pronounced for girls and ethnic communities, E-library is also available offline.  Similar to the efforts of UNICEF’s global initiative on Learning Passport, UNICEF jointly with the Government saw through a long-term vision for the Eduino Initiative as a central hub for all digital teaching material including textbooks, workbooks, audio narrations, etc. and have them all available to students free of charge. The Government owns the platform and holds the rights to all textbooks available - these multimedia and interactive textbooks will be available to all students free of charge. The online application is supplemented with  Android and Windows versions allowing students to access textbooks even in communities with limited internet coverage. Between September and December 2021 just the E-Library applications were downloaded over 130,000 times and used regularly by 27,000 students (more than the entire 4th grade population). The Eduino Initiative has since been recognized by the HundreED annual Global Collection which highlights 100 leading innovations in education around the world.
 
In 2021, UNICEF negotiated server support for Eduino from the largest telecommunications operator in the country, Telekom. More dedicated expansions were agreed with other donors including: A Digital Literacy programme in collaboration with TeachToday; collaboration with SIDA in advancing climate change education through an Eduino Virtual laboratory; and an Eduino adjunct platform for VET secondary schools funded by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation.
 
UNICEF supported the development of an innovative index for optimization of the primary school network and its human and other resources, and the drafting of municipal school optimization plans. The school optimization index measures the gaps for each primary school and municipality to meet the national educational and infrastructural standards, as well as to close the gaps between actual costs per student and costs needed to fulfill the standards. Based on the value of the index, UNICEF supports the preparation of a detailed plan for each municipality for adjusting the infrastructural and educational capacity, while the financial efficiency will be improved with the use of the new school funding formula. The optimization plans identify potential ways to improve the allocation of the limited resources to ensure all primary schools enable teaching in accordance with national standards, laws and educational concepts. The implementation of these plans will: establish an equitable system for primary education; contribute to equal teaching conditions and ensure efficient allocation of resources. These changes will be instrumental in addressing digital divide and other inequalities including those of gender, ethnicity and disability.
 
The CRC pre-session enabled the CSOs and UNICEF to unite their voice and inform the Committee about the key issues of child rights in North Macedonia.  Unlike in previous reporting cycles on the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the pre-session related to the country’s combined third to sixth reports in front of the Committee on the Rights of the Child was held online. This modality provided opportunities for a much wider participation from the civil society organizations. A particularly positive feature of the process was the coordination and communication among the participants from the CSOs prior to the pre-session which resulted in the development of a joint statement presented to the Committee. The entire process—led by the CSOs and supported by UNICEF - resulted in structured, coherent inputs to the pre-session and the dialogue with the Committee that reflected the complementarity of the roles played by the CSOs and UNICEF, respectively. As such, it enabled UNICEF to highlight issues that are essential to children’s rights and wellbeing in the country, such as the need to enhance the quality of basic social services provided to children, the importance of availability, analysis and use of child-related data in policymaking as well as the criticality of incorporating the equity aspect in addressing children’s rights. 
 
UNICEF North Macedonia was among the first country offices to finalize an Omega version of the Situational Analysis, incorporating a gender-based lens. Internally it has served as an example in the HQ-led initiative to simplify the CPD development process, with which this version of the Situational Analysis becomes mandatory. The format’s full alignment with the Convention on the Rights of the Child makes the SitAn a function - rather than a product-that facilitates the monitoring of child rights and wellbeing in the country. Moving forward, it is envisioned to be utilized as a tool to facilitate reviews of the programme implementation and its progress towards addressing main bottlenecks impeding full realization of child rights.
 
Social listening was used beyond its original objective informing social media campaigns  to address hesitancy related to the regular immunization. With the growing use of social media and the pace in which information shapes attitudes and beliefs reaches the public, UNICEF used social listening to develop relevant communication interventions to support the implementation of the national COVID-19 vaccination deployment plan. The campaign focused on addressing the myths and misinformation circulating social media during the early introduction of COVID-19 vaccines. In addition, throughout the year continued social listening has informed additional social media campaigns and established new delivery channels to engage audiences. 
 
Furthermore, in response to the growing challenge of vaccine hesitancy affecting both COVID-19 vaccine deployment and the routine immunization, the country office has been innovatively using behavioral insights and social media listening to design campaigns to address hesitancy, track and respond to disinformation as well as to engage with communities to increase demand. In doing so, the CO used Behavioral insights research completed earlier in 2021 that provided additional information on MMR1 vaccine hesitancy on both demand and the supply side. Five prototypes developed through a design thinking process were finalized and, after evaluation will be scaled up around the country after.

ECAR,Rep of Uzbekistan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The COVID-19 pandemic has clearly shown that strengthening the Nationwide infrastructure for routine immunisation, especially the cold chain system is the key to a successful rapid vaccine deployment in times of pandemics. UNICEF has developed a vaccine logistic management information system and is in the process of supporting the Government to develop electronic immunisation registries that will ensure the national immunisation programme is fully functioning and integrated into the national health management information system. Based on the lessons learned during previous years, UNICEF is leveraging digital technologies to strengthen the immunisation system further to ensure the sustainability of the program.
The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent strict lockdown measures spurred a shift towards wider telecom technologies for coordination, cooperation, professional learning, and even medicine. Vast penetration of broadband internet, even to remote areas of the county, opened up a unique opportunity to leverage technologies for better efficiency in the healthcare field. Therefore, future investments in distance learning are essential to strengthen the health care system. Implementation of new digital solutions in health care requires increasing the IT literacy of healthcare providers. UNICEF should include IT skills development of health care providers in all programme components.
Leveraging Government’s efforts in introducing innovative programmes with UNICEF’s global technical knowledge and support is crucial in enhancing the impact of the innovations and alternative provisions. For example, while the Government decided to provide internet connectivity to all schools, UNICEF, under the GIGA project, ensured that the internet connectivity is mapped and tested for real-time informing further improvement for school connectivity.
Knowledge generation and management are crucial for not only evaluating past and ongoing interventions but also for planning and designing future efforts. For example, UNICEF’s study on the Knowledge, Attitude and Practices of parents towards early childhood development have highlighted the importance of preschool experiences for school readiness among children and also, parenting practices, which are now incorporated in the social behavioural change strategies for promoting parenting practices, including through the mobile application “Bebbo”. 
Recognising the strategic importance of evidence and accountability for the realisation of child rights in Uzbekistan, particularly around equity, inclusion and child-sensitive public expenditures, the Country Programme Evaluation (CPE) emphasised the need to strengthen child rights monitoring as a cross-cutting area in the new Country Programme. In line with strategic CPE recommendation, UNICEF, in its new Country Programme (2021-2025), prioritises the establishment of an integrated child rights monitoring and reporting system for collecting sufficient and reliable evidence on the situation of children, duly disaggregated to enable identification of disparities, but also to ensure that such evidence is used to assess progress achieved in the realisation of child rights and to inform the policy and programmes development aligned with international child rights standards and best practice. 
In the absence of one single ministry responsible for social protection and welfare of vulnerable children and families, including children without parental care and in alternative care, it is strategic for UNICEF to act as a convener, bringing together key stakeholders from Government and non-governmental organisations. A delicate balance must be struck between encouraging an expedited deinstitutionalisation process, considering the substantial number of children remaining in several types of residential care in Uzbekistan, and advocating for a systematic, policy-driven and gradual change which results in less reliance on residential care and an increase in services aimed at keeping children within their families and communities. The Senate has proven to be a key partner in this regard, and due to UNICEF advocacy, the Chairperson has agreed to lead a National Coordination Group on Deinstitutionalization, mandated to oversee, and guide the further reform of the childcare system, including deinstitutionalisation of children from large-scale residential care facilities.  
Despite an initial commitment from partners to introduce diversion and restorative justice in Uzbekistan, a pilot project on diversion and restorative justice was put on hold due to the absence of a legal basis for diversion and restorative justice approach in the criminal and criminal procedural legislation of Uzbekistan. UNICEF, jointly with the Prosecutor’s General Office, introduced amendments concerning diversion and alternative measures to the draft Criminal Code; however, the latest edition of the Criminal Code is still under consideration. The main lesson learnt from this experience is the need to continue with high-level advocacy among key decision-makers and awareness-raising among justice practitioners, children, and families about the benefits of diversion and restorative justice both for children, victims of crimes, and society.  
The lessons learnt from evaluations of the Education Programme and of the District Health System Strengthening (DHSS) model were discussed jointly by UNICEF and national partners and addressed in response actions. One of the lessons from the evaluation of the DHSS model is that the planning at the primary healthcare facilities level can potentially improve health system performance. However, the major challenge in developing and applying DHSS is a quality improvement measurement which is almost impossible due to the limitations related to the availability of reliable data, the frequent absence of good baseline data, and in how to connect and use the outputs of the quality control mechanism with the broader system reform in the country. "
ECAR,Republic of Kyrgyzstan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"One of the legacies of the COVID-19 pandemic has been the rapid development and implementation of digital platforms to reach and support children, adolescents and parents. 

Building on the investments in technology and digitalization within the health and education sectors at the onset of COVID-19, in 2021 UNICEF Kyrgyzstan prioritized suitable digital platforms, such as open-source products that fit the current digital environment and long-term sustainability of the sector development within the financial constraints of the Government. 

For example, UNICEF provided support to the Ministry of Health in adapting an open-source telemedicine solution which has proved to work in low-cost, low-bandwidth settings and is customized for use in the field. The platform is built on a unique Digital Assistant which provides real-time job aids and clinical decision workflows to make it possible for family doctors to adhere to the national clinical protocols at the point of care. Through this tool, general practitioners can also consult with specialists on medical cases that require expert knowledge. 

Currently, 132 family doctors and 16 specialized medical doctors from secondary and tertiary health facilities are using the platform. Communication activities continue to ensure that families are aware of telemedicine services at the relevant health facilities and that trained family doctors are monitored to implement telemedicine successfully. 

UNICEF and MOES developed and launched two new mobile applications, Bebbo and Learning Passport, to help pre-school educators and parents access timely and high-quality teaching and learning materials where direct contact with service providers is not possible. These tools help mitigate learning loss experienced during the school closures of 2020 due to COVID-19. The Bebbo app can also be used offline which is convenient for users with limited access to internet.

In October 2021, UNICEF in partnership with the Ministry of Culture, Information, Sports and Youth Policy launched the digital youth engagement platform U-Report, a tool that empowers young people around the world. To date, 7,032 young people have subscribed to U-Report to express their views on issues that are important for their lives and in their communities. As participation in the platform grows, the results of the polls will inform decision making of both local and national authorities. With the help of U-Report, socially important and useful information can also be conveyed to young people even in the most remote regions of the country. The results of the polls can be used for further dialogue between adolescents and young people and other stakeholders, including government officials.

Instead of building a standalone platform, UNICEF partnered with UNDP to expand their job search app for young people with a new function that matches adolescents and young people with volunteer and intern opportunities to help them acquire their first experience of work. This new component - called Opportunities Marketplace - also supports skills building and strengthens pathways from education to employment. 

"
ECAR,Republic of Montenegro,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"     
The new Government led to significant  changes at the ministerial and mid-management levels, requiring increased  efforts by UNICEF to re-establish partnerships at a time when Government was  facing increased demands in the sphere of health, education and social and  child protection. In addition, the Finance and Social Welfare ministries were  merged into one, drawing more attention to public finance management, but  less to social and child protection - apart from the universal child  allowance, a major achievement. In the coming period innovative approaches  and strategies are needed to revitalize the social and child protection  sector and ensure that it is funded and monitored. The Ministry of Health  also needs support to ensure continuity of its work on promoting mental  health, psychosocial assistance, protection from violence, home visiting,  routine vaccination, and increased cooperation with other sectors to prevent  and suppress the impact of COVID-19 on citizens` health and well-being. The  revitalized Council on Child Rights proved to be instrumental for  accelerating the most pressing child rights issues in the country in an  inter-sectoral manner. The CO should further build on these good practice  examples. Also, the Parliament and its committees served as important forums  for awareness raising and monitoring of child rights policies; the CO should  cultivate its long-standing cooperation with Parliament and continue to  foster joint thematic sessions around the most pressing child rights issues  in the country. Cross-sectoral cooperation proved to be challenging in many  domains, but nonetheless should be accelerated and strengthened through  policy dialogue, policy briefs, platforms for multi-sectoral work and  financing, etc. Overall, accountability should be strengthened and clarified  for cross-sectoral initiatives.  
  One  of the key challenges in 2021 was to ensure that children and adolescents,  especially the most vulnerable, did not fall between the cracks but instead  were prioritized and provided with quality education, skills, and support,  including for social and emotional learning and mental health. In this  context, the holistic, cross-sectoral approach taken to learning and  skills-building, combining formal and non-formal learning, developed in  previous years proved essential. 
  Unfortunately,  the restructuring of the Government took almost the whole first half of 2021,  leading to considerable delays both for implementation of some regular  activities and the design and deployment of new ones. For example, although  the draft comprehensive education sector analysis was ready for approval in  January 2021, the consultation process only began in July, delaying  finalization to early 2022. However, strong partnerships with colleagues at  central educational institutions and CSO partners allowed for a rapid  deployment of well-targeted support interventions for children from highly  vulnerable groups. Also, close cooperation with the technical team at the  Ministry of Education facilitated the development of a new digital education  strategy and establishment of the digital school platform, creating the  foundation for integrating digital solutions into the education system so  that they contribute to its quality, inclusiveness, and resilience. 
  Dissolution  of the Ministry of Sports and Youth created severe delays in the development  of new policies for adolescents and youth. The newly formed Directorate for  Sports and Youth (now under the Ministry of Education, Science, Culture and  Sports) took the better part of the year to become organized and begin  functioning. With support from other agencies, mainly UNDP, by the end of the  year a plan was drafted, and an action plan developed to work on a new youth  strategy for 2022-2026.
  This  year demonstrated that improvement in realization of child rights is  principally due to political will and policies, programmes and frameworks  anchored in legislation. As fundamental custodians of political commitments  on child rights, parliamentarians are critical to achieving better results  for children. UNICEF and other national and international partners were  focused on vulnerable groups of children who experience inequality and are  not counted in national averages, as well as the barriers and bottlenecks  that prevent them from enjoying their rights and reaching their full  potential. It is clearly of critical importance to identify and support  vulnerable groups by building strong partnerships. Equity and inclusion of  all should be the main guiding principles of all national policies and  programmes advancing the rights of children. Establishing the Business Council  (BC) positioned UNICEF to leverage its neutrality to convey private sector, government,  and wider community to develop new initiatives and build alliances for  children. In all phases of business engagement, including unpacking strategic  areas for engagement, developing the BC action plan and integrating this into  CPD development, it was important to communicate how the business will  benefit through a shared value partnership. 
  Regular  meetings and informal check-ins with government partners, donors and CSOs  proved invaluable for ensuring continued national ownership and buy-in for  key programme activities, including scale-up of activities. Joint  cross-sectoral collaboration with UN agencies was complex and at times  constrained by factors such as competing aims of UN agencies and differing  definitions of partnership. However, collaboration undoubtedly has the  potential for applying greater pressure for joint work plans, joint  programmes and joint funding within the context of the UN reform. Through  regular monitoring of government strategic and legislative planning, the CO  pursued evidence-based advocacy and successfully integrated key priorities for  children into relevant national strategic documents and legislation.  Important lessons were also learned about how to support partners in the  future regarding overall planning and monitoring systems. Particularly,  M&E systems in sectors such as health, social and child protection,  education and justice urgently need to adapt more efficiently to the digital  age. The capacity for programme planning, monitoring, and reporting on  government commitments needs to be improved. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and  government transition, the country context is rapidly changing, volatile and  complex, and requires agile approaches and analysis to design and implement  evidence-based programmes.
  UNICEF  envisions four key priorities for its new country programme: (1) protecting  children from poverty, adversity and violence (2) ECD - getting the best  start to life; (3) improved learning outcomes, skills and empowerment for all  children, adolescents and young people;; and (4) institutional accountability  for child rights and leveraging resources for results for children.

ECAR,Romania,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Strengthening the role of evaluations in National strategies and programmes

In 2021 UNICEF conducted the Evaluation of the Romanian National Child Rights Strategy 2014 – 2020 which became the basis for the development of the new Strategy for 2021 - 2027. This evaluation was very different from the regular UNICEF evaluations, as it was an evaluation of a National Strategy of the Government of Romania and conducted jointly with the Romanian National Agency for Child Rights and Adoption. For this evaluation, UNICEF’s (rather the United National’s) global evaluation standards and quality assurance processes were applied successfully. As UNICEF aims to increasingly support Government’s capacity to develop more evidence-based strategies and plans and strengthen the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of these National Strategies and Programmes, UNICEF anticipates strengthening its role and capacity in evaluations. 

Investment case for promoting a Cash and Care approach

The investment case for Cash and Care undertaken in 2021 demonstrated clearly that the investment Romania can make today to reduce child poverty and social exclusion could yield 10 times their value in only eight years. But evidence also highlighted that this high rate of economic return can only be achieved if certain pre-requisites are met, and strong political commitment is present. The preconditions include issues linked to fiscal decentralization and public administration reform; systematic vertical and horizontal coordination within administrations; strengthening the public procurement system (including by allowing NGOs/private providers to access public funds); accelerated reform of social protection and care systems (e.g., performance monitoring, integrating cash system(s) with care services/systems); and maintaining a workforce of skilled, specialized social service professionals.  

Progress in digital solutions

The Country Office’s engagement in promoting digital solutions continued and in the area of digital health. In 2021 UNICEF promoted an innovative and first of its kind public-private partnership involving the Ministry of Health, Code 4 Romania (a nonprofit leader in the field of developing architecture for digital solutions for public services), and the Center for Health Policies and Services (a leader in optimizing delivery of primary health care), to ensure that the digital application for community nurses is developed to be user friendly, accepted by users and accompanied with a training package to roll it out at national level. 
At the same time the Country office started also in partnership with Code 4 Romania and in close cooperation with UNICEF led Children Board developing the local version of the mobile application to replace the current U-Report mechanism and to enhance it with an innovative, engaging and gamified component of Facts-for-life. It is an attempt to develop a combined innovative application to stimulate child participation and to ensure access to reliable, user-friendly and child designed application to help build safe behaviors among children in relation with health, prevention of violence, climate change and others. Moreover, the application will have the possibility to have city-based versions that will be used in the process of promoting the Child Friendly City Initiative where there are already 6 cities enrolled and other 4 expressing high interest (including 2 out of the 6 sectors of the capital city Bucharest)

 Media-literacy to empower children to engage and participate
 
The Media Literacy conference organized by the Center for Independent Journalism with the support of UNICEF and in partnership with the Romanian-American Foundation was innovative, using a hybrid format, filmed by professionals and transmitted live to the public. Children, teachers, authorities, and other experts in this area were guest speakers at the two-day event that raised awareness on the role of media literacy in supporting civic participation by children and youth. It also presented national and international best practices, stimulated exchanges among teachers and highlighted the media’s involvement in combating misinformation. 

Improved protection against sexual violence.
To strengthen gender equality and protect girls and women from violence, exploitation and abuse, UNICEF Romania continued its strategic partnership with the National Agency for Equal Opportunities between Women and Men. With TA from UNICEF, supported by “COVID-19 Flexible Fund to advance Gender/GBV”, a set of new operating procedures were co-created with actors from relevant fields, providing concrete guidance for addressing sexual violence. This promises to result in improved coordination of services, especially for child victims of violence, marking a welcome step forward for Romania as a pathfinding country of the Global Programme against Violence.

Promising fundraising results from first attempt with ad-on bills

After nearly 2 years of collaboration with one of the leading corporate partner to develop the technical capability to make it possible for their more than 3 million customers to contribute to UNICEF through the monthly online bill payment, the corporate ‘add-on bill’ campaign was piloted successfully. Customers who paid their energy bills through the company’s mobile app could add a small donation (c. US$0.25) to their bill as a donation to UNICEF. The pilot was a one-off payments but the results are very promising, and the country office is working with the corporate partner to transform this pilot project into a ‘corporate pathway to pledge’ initiative in 2022.

ECAR,Serbia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"FOSTERING INNOVATION AND USE OF TECHNOLOGIES
 
Innovation has been at the heart of UNICEF’s change strategies, both globally and in Serbia, and the local context provides a fruitful environment for further expanding this area of work. Internally, UNICEF has also strengthened its systematic approach to innovation by establishing an innovation coordination group, which met regularly.
 
Jointly with UNDP and WHO, UNICEF launched a clean air challenge calling on tech-companies to find viable solutions to address air pollution in Serbia; one of the challenges focused on ‘clean air for children’. The challenge resulted in the development of monitoring devices consisting of low-cost sensors for measuring particulate matter (PM1, PM2.5 and PM10) and NO2 and SO2. Following the clean air challenge, UNICEF applied the winning solution to initiate a model air pollution programme in selected municipalities and schools to promote knowledge and awareness around air pollution among children and youth.
 
In order to provide relevant, safe, age-appropriate and trusted information on well-being, self-care, resilience and early detection to young people facing mental health challenges, and through an innovative approach using a youth reference group to guide UNICEF, an innovative online platform with reliable information about MHPSS was launched by UNICEF. The platform will be further developed to include trainings and resources for young persons, teachers, parents and social workers so that everyone can support the well-being of children and young people. More than 3,000 young people visited the platform within the first month.
 
Parents are at the centre of children’s well-being and healthy development, and in 2021 the UNICEF-supported HaloBeba mobile application, which has been an invaluable resource to many parents, was scaled up by UNICEF ECARO to expand to another 11 countries using 18 languages under a new name: Bebbo. The revamped app, which supports parents in learning about nurturing care and following their child’s growth and development, will be launched in Serbia in January 2022.
 
While the COVID-19 pandemic has disturbed learning activities for many, it has also contributed to accelerating innovations. With the visionary work having started in 2018, the National Learning Portal for Teachers, developed by the Institute for Improvement of Education and UNICEF, served as a key information hub and professional development portal for educators, with over 440,000 unique visitors and over 1 million views in 2021. All system-wide teacher trainings with an online component are now conducted via this platform, reaching 88,000 teachers in 2021 alone, thereby transforming the opportunities and the reach of teachers’ professional development.
 
UNICEF in Serbia leveraged its collaboration with ICT business sector partners to develop various innovative solutions for individual giving, from smart benches and digital kiosks to receive donations from passers-by to ground-breaking work to launch a first-ever campaign using unique digital non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the cryptocurrency realm for development purposes. UNICEF mobilized street artists, game developers and national ambassadors as well as partners from the blockchain community and created the first UNICEF NFT collection, which was presented for UNICEF’s 75th Anniversary. The collection is placed in an online auction using Ethereum cryptocurrency. The proceeds from the sale of the NFTs will be used for the procurement of assistive technology that will help children with disabilities improve their quality of life. This will establish the ground for support of companies and individuals involved in blockchain technology and opens up future opportunities to expand the network of supporters for UNICEF’s mission.
 
LESSONS LEARNED
 
Due to various factors in the external environment, processes to endorse relevant policies and regulatory changes were often prolonged and remain among the key bottlenecks for accelerated realization of child rights in 2021. With new parliamentary elections scheduled for April 2022, strategic prioritization of feasible and flexible approaches towards achieving results will therefore need to be informed by constant examination of the external context and changing risk factors that might negatively impact on planned activities, particularly in areas that are highly politicized.
 
Given the mandate of UNICEF and its focus on equity, meaning that particular attention is put on the most vulnerable and marginalized groups and behaviours being driven by social norms (such as discrimination, segregation, violent disciplining, child marriage, etc.), there is a need to strengthen overall efforts to change attitudes and practices (social norms) in across sectors. This applies not only to actions aimed at the wider public audience but also to professionals and decision-makers, as deeply rooted social norms and prejudices shape their practices incl. on gender and ethnicity, whether directly working with children and their families or engaging in shaping policies in all social sectors, such as health, education and social welfare.
 
With the protracted pandemic, hybrid service delivery modalities are now used in all social sectors – including social welfare, patronage services, mental health, early interventions, education and preschool – and are here to stay. Further action is required to anchor these into the daily operations and delivery of services rather than being perceived as an emergency response. In order to transform practices to respond to learners’ needs especially, policymakers need to develop a deeper understanding of the educational benefits of different delivery approaches and to address equity challenges. While there is commitment to ensure equity, vulnerable groups tend to face multidimensional disadvantages that will require sustained efforts well beyond the immediate crisis recovery. The well-being of professionals is also an important consideration with new working modalities, while the importance of face-to-face and human contact cannot be ignored, in particular in reaching those most at risk.
 
The involvement of young people in all areas of programming has proved to be of critical importance. A good example was the successful campaign on MHPSS, where a reference group of 15 people aged 17 to 23 was formed in August 2021, showing how important their views are, including in defining the topics and ensuring that the content is written in a youth-friendly manner. Another lesson learned was the establishment of an ethical board or mechanism, where child mental health experts contributed to ensure the content on the website is safe and appropriate for use.

ECAR,Tajikistan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Leveraging government infrastructure investments to support development for children 
To promote innovative approaches and streamline child sensitivity in the GoT strategic planning and monitoring processes, UNICEF continued collaboration with the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade (MEDT) withing the framework of the initiative aimed at leveraging the infrastructure investments to support subnational district-level development of urban and rural areas with best interests of children in mind. This was done through a comprehensive framework comprised of child-friendly approaches to planning and programming.
Thus, in cooperation with the MEDT, UNICEF continued engagement in the initiative that aimed at improving life circumstances of the children and families affected by the infrastructure projects in the Rasht valley. Thus, an in-dept situation analysis was conducted by a joint MEDT-UNICEF team in two neighbouring districts along a new Roghun bypass road to set a baseline of the situation of children in the affected villages. The findings are being used to improve the district development programmes. In addition, the experience and lessons learnt are described in a manual that can be used by other UNICEF offices wishing to transform an area affected by an infrastructure project into a child-friendly territory.
This shall lead to the improvement of the two district development programmes (DDPs) 2021-2025 with in-depth understanding of children’s needs and propose solutions to address them. The DDPs are an important planning tool at the subnational level, deriving from the national priorities and embedded into the local context, and present a framework for operationalising national development agenda through fundraising at the local level and national financial flows.
This is the first-ever initiative of this type in Tajikistan that involved close collaboration with the government entities at national and local levels, international financial institutions and other actors. When completed, the lessons learnt and good practices are expected to be used for upgrading the GoT’s methodological guides for development of the DDPs across the country, a handbook for UNICEF offices and a set of recommendation for the IFIs to include child-sensitive analysis into the Environmental and Socio-Economic Assessments (ESIA) of IFI-funded infrastructure projects.
SDG financing for children
UNICEF and other UN agencies are championing the SDG financing agenda in Tajikistan, including the public finance for children. To be able to do this effectively and sustainably, UNICEF needs to clearly understand the financial flows in the country’s financial architecture and be able to account for vertical and horizontal intragovernmental dynamics. This is vital to be able to create and maintain level playing field relations with the national and international financial institutions and strengthen the position UNICEF has gained in other areas of expertise on children’s rights in Tajikistan.  To this end, key UNICEF staff completed a public finance for children training in 2021. Besides, several learning sessions were proposed to the UNICEF staff on the budgetary and financial system of Tajikistan with participation of the lead national and international experts, followed by the discussions on how to enhance/utilise the knowledge within the ongoing and future UNCEF programmes.
Disaster preparedness and contingency planning – key to timely and effective response 
Collaborative efforts on disaster preparedness and contingency planning in Tajikistan have been key to successfully responding to various crises in a timely and effectively manor. Over the past several years, UNICEF worked closely with government actors and other partners to enhance DRR and risk-informed emergency preparedness/response to manage vulnerabilities and strengthen resilience among children around the country. The PRM facility allowed for flexibility in navigating uncertainty and complexity for real-time decisions based on the ground reality.
In 2021, UNICEF made significant investment on preparedness, leveraging the partnership with the National Red Crescent Society and collaboration with UNHCR on the Refugee Response Plan for the Afghan Outflow and contributed to lesson learnt in cross-country/cross-regional humanitarian action in relation to a potential outflow of Afghan refugees to Central Asia. 
As a result of this engagement, at the onset of the Afghan crisis, UNICEF was able to quickly activate the Education Emergency Group within the Development Coordination Council and Local Education Group. This ensured an adequate and immediate education support for both Afghan children and children among the host population. Furthermore, these preparedness activities also allowed UNICEF and partners to quickly initiate the capacity building programme on child protection with State Border Troops.
In addition, preparedness efforts in partnership with MoES and IsDB, enabled UNICEF to timely and effectively respond to mudflows in Khatlon region and an earthquake in Rasht valley, providing school furniture and supplies to 25 affected schools (10 in Khatlon and 15 in Rasht) and thereby ensuring uninterrupted education for 8,801 schoolchildren (4,240 girls).
Global and regional innovations in Tajikistan 
UNICEF, in collaboration with MoHSPP, contextualized the Bebbo Mobile Parenting Application for parents, caregivers, family doctors and nurses to promote nurturing care of children from 0-6 years. Comprehensive, evidence-based information and interactive tools in the app will cover material and provide reminders to track a child’s development, immunization and health check-ups, as well as support with early learning, nutrition, responsive parenting, protection and safety. The app serves as a useful source of information for early childhood development specialists and practitioners in Tajikistan, and also provides a new way of thinking of how the health system and parenting can work.
Similarly, in collaboration with MoES, UNICEF developed MakTab Mobile (https://maktabmobile.tj/), a digital learning platform that allows teachers to teach lesson content in new and interesting ways. The app works offline, is accessible, easy to use and can be localized. Lessons are given through a variety of multimedia elements, including videos, animations, photos, and audio recordings. The app offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at your own pace in and outside of the classroom. This innovative learning platform helps ensure the next generation in Tajikistan is responsive to evolving labour markets and can bridge other gaps in learning and development.

ECAR,Türkiye,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Accelerating results for children during COVID-19: The COVID response continued to pose challenges to programme implementation and reaching the children left furthest behind. UNICEF and its partners adjusted by conducting many activities online or through hybrid modalities. With respect to child protection risk mitigation, innovative alternatives to traditional face-to-face activities were introduced through the provision of remote/online psycho-social counselling, case management and prevention interventions. However, it was observed that while remote modalities expanded the pool of beneficiaries reached, they also made identification of the most at risk/vulnerable groups more difficult, and potentially created challenges in access to sensitive services such as counselling and responses to gender-based violence). The importance of involving communities and families in programme implementation became more critical.
School closures and the suspension of non-formal education programmes due to the pandemic resulted in challenges for the participation of the most vulnerable children in education. Therefore, the inclusion of community members in identifying out-of-school children in outreach activities became more important. UNICEF worked with MoNE on the revision of TVET programmes based on the needs of the changing job market and to integrate transferable and digital skills. More than 1.3 million students (532,024 girls; 796,761 boys) benefited. UNICEF supported establishment of multi-purpose digital centres to implement digital learning solutions to ensure learning continuity in formal education. Teacher professional development was supported to accelerate skills in teaching basic literacy and numeracy in hybrid/blended settings. Support was also provided to equip school counsellors and teachers to support education stakeholders' mental health and psychosocial well-being.. Strategic support was also provided for MoNE to procure necessary supplies and services to ensure safe school reopening during the pandemic.
Fathers, who were spending more time at home during the pandemic, needed to be engaged in supporting their young children’s early learning. The home-based early childhood education module originally targeted mothers, who are usually the primary caregivers of young children at home, so UNICEF worked to develop a Father Education Programme aimed at increasing their involvement in supporting their children’s development.
The temporary release of more than 800 convicted children in April 2020 due to the health risks caused by the pandemic was extended numerous times until December 2021. Although the reoffending rates of these children are unclear, this situation clearly demonstrated the feasibility of community-based alternatives to detention. UNICEF raised this point in discussions with Government stakeholders and presented it as a basis for the development of a comprehensive proposal on diversion, restorative justice and alternatives to detention. The experience underlined the importance of follow-up on the effects of such policy decisions and of translating them into advocacy.
Skills agenda: The acquisition of skills forms part of children’s rights to learning and can assist adolescents and young people in their socioeconomic and psychological wellbeing by providing them with future opportunities. The recently established Business Advisory Board is magnifying reach and impact of UNICEF’s work on the skills agenda and will contribute towards establishing a holistic skills policy framework in 2022. Facilitating public-private partnerships will allow for greater scalability and sustainability of programmes. 
Social Protection System strengthening: UNICEF has supported the Ministry of Family and Social Services (MoFSS) in the development and use of technology platforms and innovations that will strengthen the analytical/operational backbone of its social protection systems. The Business Intelligence and Data Warehouse, which will be embedded into the MoFSS Integrated Social Assistance System (ISAIS) Mainframe, will increase analytical and operational capacity of the Ministry and empower decision-makers by providing detailed reports and data-powered dashboards that visualize all outputs/outcomes and provide real-time dataflow, and by making the ISAIS capable of running big-data analyses and forecasts.
Role-modelling approach: The role modelling approach for the elimination of child marriage was seen to provide opportunities for sustained community engagement for long-lasting change in social and gender norms. Role models shared their stories to encourage other parents and caregivers to prevent child marriage. The modality proved to be most effective when role models from the community shared similar stories and experiences with beneficiaries in terms of taking positive initiatives and safeguarding children against child marriage.  
Supply chain “first”: Through its partnership with the Dutch Natcom, UNICEF Turkey is undertaking supply chain analysis for the first time and seeking out champions on child rights through partnership with the international private sector. The recent moves of EU countries to ban products involving human rights violations added to the importance of monitoring and elimination exercises across supply chains. This partnership is expected to facilitate further deliberations on combating child labour and strengthening partnerships with the private sector. This UNICEF work is likely to be a pioneer for similar actions in Turkey and other countries. 
UNSDCF Implementation: The process of developing the UNSDCF, including the finalisation of the Joint Work Plans in 2021, has shown that UNICEF will need to invest greater time and effort in the coordination mechanisms. UNICEF will continue engaging closely with the Office of the Resident Coordinator, particularly in leading and steering the discussion on monitoring and reporting. This will include, but will not be limited to, the simplification of the JWPs, prioritisation of strategic areas and work towards the identification of new Joint Programmes, especially in areas of climate change, environment, and economy of care, where UNICEF can bring strategic added value.
Public finance: Public Finance for Children (PF4C) is an emerging area under the Country Programme for 2021-2025. In this context, UNICEF’s work on the Child-Friendly City initiative has been steered in the direction of child-sensitive planning, budgeting and financing in local governance. In support of this, UNICEF is developing an online platform to monitor sub-national spending for children. Municipalities will be able to input their budget data and create scorecards. On national public finance, a PF4C taskforce has been formed at the Presidency of Strategy and Budget, and induction sessions are being carried out by UNICEF. UNICEF is also working on developing costed ECE service provision models and ECE investment cases to inform public finance and fiscal decisions at national and local levels.

ECAR,Turkmenistan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Blended Learning Approaches
 
The pandemic related restrictions on the international and in-country travels coupled with the generally weak quality of internet connectivity across the regions motivated UNICEF Turkmenistan Education Team to seek innovative approaches for ensuring quality and continuity of the ongoing technical support and to achieve the planned CPD targets. One of the innovative implementing modalities deployed in 2021 for the realization of the Partnership Cooperation Agreement with the St. Petersburg Early Intervention Institute (SPB EII) is delivery of blended forms of learning to the cross-sectoral partners from the health, education, and social protection sectors nation-wide. The blended modality used for the 6-module “training on preparation of the trans-disciplinary specialist” for 150 trainees across the country and sectors employed both online distance communication and learning, and offline self-study, facilitated by various communication formats. Blended learning modality demonstrated its effectiveness especially when larger volumes of knowledge need to be transmitted involving wider groups of participants. 
Preparedness for Emergencies
 
In 2021 UNICEF Turkmenistan scaled up its emergency preparedness capacity to provide effective response in the event of potential emergencies. A renewed partnership was established with National Red Crescent Society, for the first time CO established warehousing capacity and prepositioned core emergency response supplies. Together, UNHCR, UNFPA and UNICEF strengthened the UN contingency planning for a potential Refugee Influx from Afghanistan by developing a Regional Refugee Response Plan which has been launched in an appeal event on 11 January 2022. Given Turkmenistan’s exposure to multiple risks (earthquakes, droughts, floods, sandstorms, epidemic) and increased vulnerability due to the volatile security situation in neighboring Afghanistan, the preparedness activities undertaken in 2021 and continuing, established a higher level of readiness and capacity to respond timely in the event of emergencies. UNICEF ECARO support and EMOPS Global Humanitarian Thematic Fund allocation, have made a valuable contribution in support of CO efforts.
UNICEF@75 in the Spotlight
 
In December 2021 UNICEF Turkmenistan joined the world in celebrations of its 75th anniversary, by conducting various activities in a creative way, and engaging in a series of global initiatives with the participation of the Government, youth, general population, and former and current UNICEF team members. The activities included signing workplans for 2022 with fourteen Government partners, joining the #GoBlue campaign by illuminating “Berkarar” shopping and entertainment center in blue, projecting UNICEF anniversary logo on public screens across the country, and participation of Turkmenistan in inaugural Global Forum for Children and Youth (CY21), where a young SDG Ambassador and climate activist from Turkmenistan spoke about the successful experience of the country on integrating the climate change into primary and secondary education curriculum and strengthening the resilience of the youth in Turkmenistan towards the climate change impacts. The series of innovative and high visibility events placed UNICEF in the spotlight on its anniversary, providing wide coverage in the traditional and social media about UNICEF history, mandate, and programmes in Turkmenistan and globally."
ECAR,Ukraine,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"A key focus in 2021 was the development of the new Ukraine Country Programme Document (CPD) for 2023-2027. Several flagship studies were developed together with government institutions, NGOs and academia to generate evidence for national strategic planning and prioritization and informed the new CPD - a Situation Analysis on Children; an assessment of the situation in conflict-affected territories; a child-centered multi-hazard risk analysis; a Country Programme Evaluation and several sectoral evaluations. A UNICEF CPD stock-take workshop with key stakeholders, as well as a UNCT retreat reflected on key lessons learned from the current CPD and UNDAF and undertook visioning exercises for the next cycle. UNICEF held CPD consultations with government, parliament, civil society and donors and hosted several missions by the UNICEF Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia.  
Key lessons learned, innovations and emerging opportunities were identified to inform the programme rationale and draft CPD outcome/outputs and will guide the 2022 Annual Management Plan and Annual Work Plan to accelerate change in the transition phase before the start of the new CPD. 
-        Cross-sectoral, child-centered approach - The CPE and CPD stock-take exercise highlighted the need for stronger cross-sectoral cooperation based on a child-centred, life-cycle approach. To reach those who are most at risk of being left behind - including children living in poverty, with disabilities, from minority communities, in institutional care and suffering from violence, or affected by the conflict - UNICEF will promote age-specific, integrated approaches. This entrails breaking down sectoral barriers and promoting joint action: for young children through early childhood development and quality pre-primary and primary education; for adolescents and youth by promoting skills and wellbeing, including mental health, and ensuring programming for and with adolescents and youth. In parallel UNICEF will also pursue a cross-cutting focus on poverty reduction, resilience building and social inclusion.  

-        Humanitarian-Development Nexus – The risk-informed analysis highlighted the need for strengthening risk-informed programming and resilience building.  The incomplete decentralization reform highlighted the rtunity and need for stronger sub-national engagement for children with a view to making decentralization work for all children and families. As a result UNICEF decided to strengthen programming focused on the humanitarian-development nexus with a focus on building shock-responsive systems and ensuring integrated delivery of services. A key requirement for making this shift happen is for UNICEF to increase its field presence with focus on cross-sectoral programme delivery.

-        Social and Behaviour Change & Communication – A lesson learned from the COVID-19 pandemic and polio response – in light of growing misinformation on vaccines - has been the urgent need to strengthen national capacities for behaviour change  communication.  UNICEF is therefore aiming to ensure effective communication for social change by national partners with developing expert capacities, integrating BI and partnering with Academia. UNICEF’s strong focus on communication and public advocacy has been further strengthened to give a voice to children and adolescents and to increase UNICEF’s reach among and strengthen its brand. Through digital capacity building and mentorship programmes, UNICEF identified and trained over 1,750 young people in digital storytelling, journalism, video blogging for social impact, online activism and advocacy, creating a community of youth creators who develop innovative content with UNICEF support on issues related to the child rights agenda. A focus on digital communication resulted in an increase of UNICEF social media followers in 2021 from 480,000 to 905,000 people. With over 6,000 content items produced through the year, UNICEF ensure 13.4 million reach every month on average across its social media platforms. The traffic to and engagement to the UNICEF webpage has increased exponentially in 2021 with over 1.6 million users - a triple increase from last year -  and 2.2 million unique page views.  

-        Evidence & Accountability – The SitAn, CPE and the SDG Monitoring Report highlighted that Ukraine has an acute shortage of relevant quality, disaggregated data and significant systemic weakness on child rights monitoring. Given that the last census is more than twenty  years old and no other relevant household data collection on children and women has been collected in the last ten years UNICEF committed to making evidence generation (including through administrative data) a key priority in the 2022 and the next CPD. The recent successful use of innovative data collection methods as through big data highlighted the opportunities in this area. Another key priority is to strengthen cross-ministerial coordination and independent child rights monitoring. To promote this UNICEF will further expand its cooperation of the Ombudsperson Institution and the Parliament as well as promote the formation of civil society alliances. 

-        Partnerships & Investments in Children – UNICEF's analysis of its public sector partnerships and the new Business Impact Analysis highlighted the need for diversification of UNICEF’s partner portfolio and opportunities for strengthening private sector engagement. As a result UNICEF reached out to a range of non-traditional donors and created new opportunities for partnership and developed a new engagement platform with the private sector through a Business Advisory Council. Moreover, UNICEF will place a stronger focus on leveraging public finance for children and engagement with international financial institutions and regional banks. In 2022 UNICEF is also planning to reinforce its UN partnerships especially in key cross-cutting areas such as humanitarian development-nexus, poverty reduction, social inclusion, gender equality, disability and youth - to maximise synergies in the UN’s work and ensure the success of the UN reform. 
And last but not least, internally, UNICEF will focus on making its operations fit for purpose - by creating synergies for cross-sectoral programming; increasing its foot-print in the field, including in humanitarian coordination; improving internal governance and accountability processes; strengthening responsibilities of national staff; increasing transparency of and staff participation in key programme and management decisions; improving staff wellbeing as well as ensuring that key values of care, respect, integrity, trust and accountability are upheld and lived.

ESAR,Angola,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"New National Policy for Social Action
The new National Policy for Social Action (PNAS), which was developed with UNICEF support and enacted in February this year, is a milestone in system strengthening and advocacy for the creation of multi-sectoral coordination platforms. The PNAS offers a further opportunity to engage with government counterparts and provides the much-needed institutional push for greater coordination at central, provincial and local levels to enhance the Social Protection agenda. Strategic partnerships with civil society have also proved crucial in adapting to the ever-evolving pandemic situation and are complementary to the new PNAS in ensuring timely and effective social service delivery for children in Angola.
Improving Information management system for social cash transfers
Further to the Social Protection agenda, the social cash transfer Management Information System (MIS) was strengthened, and digitalization of all the operational processes rolled out even amidst the protracted COVID-19 pandemic. Technology continues to play a critical role with the digitalization of all these processes leading to greater efficiency through timely performance monitoring of operations for the social cash transfers programme. In addition, the quality of the Social Registry was enhanced, allowing for better planning, monitoring, evaluation and reporting of service provision. During the emergency response, the local level health system (health units) MIS was also included in the roll out and this innovation served to provide a boost in efficiency and again allowed for the monitoring of data and information in a timely manner.
Digitizing Outreach to Youth
The Digital Livelihoods Challenge was promoted in collaboration with the UNICEF regional office for Eastern and Southern Africa, in Portuguese language, with 70,000 adolescents and young people engaged through social media and U-Report. With UNICEF efforts, more than 18,000 young people expressed their interest in the regional initiative to network with other youth to develop entrepreneurial opportunities. It also demonstrated the importance of having these resources in the Portuguese language to bring to scale such opportunities to empower young people in Angola.
Giving voice to young people of Angola - U-Report
Further to the U-Report (SMS Jovem), with its soft launch in Angola in December 2020, key stakeholders (UNICEF, UNFPA, Ministry of Youth, Ministry of Telecommunication) developed a common vision to empower young people to express their views on issues important to them.
The youth of the country welcomed the platform with initial polls showing an engagement rate of well over 80%, and in 2021 in Angola more than 70,000 U-Reporters subscribed. Subsequently, UNFPA and UNICEF collaborated to organize the U-Report (SMS Jovem) campaign, which brought impressive positive results with massive registration of young people during and following the campaign.
To sustain the U-Report (SMS Jovem) initiative, stable financial support must be ensured, especially to avoid delays in expansion, along with cooperation and agreement between the local mobile operators. Going forwards, UNICEF will focus on ways to engage girls, young people in remote provinces and specific vulnerable groups such as persons with disabilities.
Enhancing the Quality of Education
Through consistent advocacy and constant technical guidance to both the Ministry of Education (MED) and Ministry of Finance, the groundwork was laid for the formulation of the local education group (LEG officially endorsed January 2022), representing a wide range of strategic partners and stakeholders. With the LEG in place, Global Partnership for Education (GPE) funds can now be accessed by the Government of Angola to further support MED translate high-level policies and guidelines, for example the National Special Education Policy Oriented towards Inclusion (2018) into more tangible change in practice at the municipality and school levels. This is a valuable funding opportunity that can strengthen the education system to address gaps between policy guidelines and on the ground practices to achieve universal coverage and quality education for children and adolescents in Angola.
Strengthening synergies among WASH and Education
UNICEF Angola has been actively engaging local and central health authorities to successfully overcome the challenge of taking an integrated approach in planning and carrying out emergency preparedness and response activities in schools. Specifically, UNICEF imparted critical information for sound risk-informed preparedness and planning for WASH programmes within the education sector. 
The importance of high-level buy-in was emphasized in a regional event in May 2021 organized by the UNICEF Regional Office for Eastern and Southern Africa, the provincial education cabinet and the World Health Organization. The focus was on how UNICEF worked with WHO and colleagues from the two ministries to develop a comprehensive action plan to strengthen coordination between the health and education sectors to ensure schools remain open and provide enhanced opportunities for safe learning. The Action Plan remains to be approved due to competing priorities, which highlights the need to further enhance advocacy efforts.
"
ESAR,Botswana,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to have an impact on children’s rights and continuity of services for children reaching far beyond the health sector. In the health sector, the focus on COVID-19 prevention and response in addition to restrictions on movement during the state of emergency had an impact on continuity of routine immunization services and uptake of child wellbeing clinic appointments for under-fives. For example, vaccination coverage of children under 1 year, dropped from 90% in 2019 to 49% in 2020 and 47.5% in 2021 for all antigens used in routine immunization. However, in some instances, the COVID-19 vaccination and its rollout have been beneficial to strengthening the health system as more cold chain equipment has been acquired, personnel have seen their capacity in EPI reinforced and M&E tools have been improved. These gains will continue to strengthen the EPI programme beyond the COVID-19 vaccination roll-out, provided that decreases in demand can also be tackled.
While Botswana made commendable efforts to keep schools open in 2021, the government had to take the difficult decision to close schools for several weeks during the third COVID-19 wave between June and August, leading to disruptions in learning. With children spending more time at home during this time, police records and reports from implementing partners continued to document increases in violence, including sexual violence, against children. The COVID-19 pandemic is therefore threatening to reverse some of the gains in terms of child rights that Botswana has made over the decades. 
While remote working and virtual engagement could be considered the new way of working in 2021, this continues to pose challenges in terms of access to digital platforms, thus limiting the quality and frequency of interactions, especially with government. Furthermore, travel restrictions slowed down implementation of field work by consultants working on research assignments. 
In 2021 UNICEF responded to these challenges by ensuring that COVID-19 programming was integrated into regular programming wherever possible, including annual work plans with government counterparts and that the COVID-19 response is supported in a manner that ensures wider systems strengthening. For example, the CO has supported the MoHW through an expert focusing on both COVID-19 and health systems strengthening. 
A further adaptive mechanism constituted in strengthening digitization and virtual approaches in programming. In UNICEF-supported programmes on adolescents and HIV, the use of innovation and technology has proven to be successful in increasing reach and coverage, bearing huge dividends in meaningfully engaging adolescents and young people and ensuring their continuous access to information and services. Over the course of 2020 and 2021, peer education programmes were moved to virtual platforms, thereby successfully ensuring continuity of access to information and support for vulnerable adolescents at risk of HIV. With the end of the State of Emergency in October, UNICEF implementing partners have, however, raised challenges around fatigue with virtual engagement platforms among adolescents. This highlights the need to reflect critically and creatively on how to sustain virtual engagement and balance it with other forms of interaction in order to keep adolescents motivated and committed.
Additionally, concerted efforts must be made to ensure equitable access to devices and data for digital engagement, particularly among the most vulnerable and marginalized youth, including those out of school and from remote and under-served areas to ensure no one is being left behind.  UNICEF’s support to school connectivity through the national SMARTBOTS connectivity programme as well as efforts to support the MoBE in developing a national strategy on ICT integration in learning and teaching will contribute to bridging the digital divide for children and young people in Botswana.  
Challenges around coordination of government and development partners around key areas of engagement persisted in 2021, heightened by the additional levels of support for the COVID-19 response. While the MoHW hosted the first Primary Health Care Consultative Forum in Botswana in November, there is a lack of regular platforms for engagement and coordination around support to the health sector. Similarly, in child protection, which is a sector crowded by many stakeholders, there is no sector-wide coordination forum. In 2022, UNICEF will – in consultation with other UN agencies and development partners – continue to advocate with key government counterparts for the establishment of such coordination mechanisms and take the lead in contributing to their establishment where possible.
Furthermore, the availability of recent data and the lack of nationally representative surveys on child deprivations as well as real-time monitoring data on key performance indicators continued to pose a challenge to evidence-based decision-making on policies and resource allocation. As a good practice, UNICEF Botswana, with the help of the Regional Office, was able to support the MoHW with bi-weekly analytics emerging from social media listening exercises. This data was then used to inform messaging around COVID-19 related RCCE. Moreover, the UNICEF-supported mapping of education sector data will provide recommendations on strengthening the timeliness and quality of data produced by the Education Management Information System.
UNICEF Botswana notes the glaring paucity of data and reporting on children with disabilities in Botswana. Efforts will need to focus on building capacity of partners on the collection of disability disaggregated data. Programming should also ensure that children with disabilities are reached and/or targeted with interventions where needed. 
South-south cooperation was accentuated in 2021 through BNLES sub-regional resource mobilisation related to COVID-19 support on vaccine deployment and maintenance of the cold chain. There was also an opportunity to reflect on the support from the BLNES Hub and how to enhance collaboration and accountability in 2022. Furthermore, the Botswana CO worked closely with 3 countries in the sub-region to arrange for commemoration of the Word Children’s Day by lighting Kazungula Bridge blue in the presence of the Presidents of Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe. At the same occasion child and youth dialogues were facilitated with the heads of state. The event was considered a best practice in high level prioritisation of child and youth rights in the SADC region."
ESAR,Burundi,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Evidence-based advocacy 

The Government's decision to increase its budgetary allocation for immunization from $400,000 to $1 million demonstrates the power of evidence-based advocacy backed by technical expertise. Based on the success of the Burundi Adolescent Investment Case in placing adolescents at the center of programming, UNICEF developed an investment case for ECD which will be bolstered by the expected adoption of the national ECD strategy. 
UNICEF supported the Government in implementing the pilot national cash transfer programme (Merankabandi) combining cash transfers with complementary interventions to improve maternal and child health.   The documentation of initial results show that the level of stunting among beneficiaries is 12 points lower than in the control group, thanks to adoption of good nutrition practices. UNICEF’s engagement contributed to the successful negotiation of a grant from the World Bank for $150 million for a second phase. UNICEF also mobilized 3.5 million Euro from the Government of Belgium to consolidate the ECD approach to ensure that households are fully independent before the programme's end, and to provide further guidance and modellng for the next phase.
As the lead agency for the education sector, UNICEF supported the Ministry of Education generating evidence on out-of-school children and evaluating the education system reform. The results served as a reference for the education sector analysis and next ten-year sector plan. Two other studies are underway: the national strategy for inclusive education and the feasibility study on systematically setting up preschool classrooms in each basic education school. These efforts have been key to successful resource mobilization for the sector (ECHO, Education Cannot Wait).

Community-based approaches for improved resilience
In Burundi, UNICEF works with a wide range of solidarity groups (SG) across all sectors. A study on the solidarity groups documented their different approaches, which will allow the review and potential harmonization of approaches in 2022. Key results and lessons to date are included below.

Community-based savings and loan groups focused on child protection increased from 4,157 in 2019 to 5,590 in 2021. The SG supported 208,043 vulnerable children (109,112 girls; 98,931 boys) and orphans to enroll in school, receive food, clothing and other services. The solidarity groups facilitated access to good parenting training for 100,443 parents (55,823 mothers; 44,620 fathers). Anecdotal evidence indicates a reduction of child rights violations in 2021 due to increased parental knowledge. The parenting training for solidarity groups created a multiplier effect on messaging on children’s issues, whose members, in turn, reached out to other parents in their communities with information on good parenting.   
The role of SGs in improving adolescent employment and access to social and financial assets was strengthened; 2,304 solidarity groups provided loans to their members accumulating financial capital of almost 400 million Burundian francs (equivalent to $210,500). In addition, as online platforms have limited reach, peer education remains a key channel to reach marginalized adolescents when introducing an online platform. With a digital platform facilitating self-learning, adolescents need external moderation and peer interactions to maximize their learning experiences. 
UNICEF also worked with SG to support 5,000 households and 22,224 children (11,743 girls; 10,481 boys) displaced due to floods in Gatumba. SG serve as the entry point for a package of interventions (income generation, sanitation and hygiene, nutrition, protection/gender-based violence) and are provided with a one-time lump sum cash transfer. This approach is an example of the humanitarian-development nexus as it focuses on enhancing resilience, enabling children and their families to cope with and recover from the shock.
 
New partnerships 

ECD – Nutrition: the high-level National Forum for Women Leaders, attended by the President, government officials, donors, ambassadors and other officials, demonstrated the Government’s commitment to the fight against all forms of malnutrition. The declaration with key recommendations signed by the First Lady will be followed by a road map for implementation.
UNICEF supported the National Commission for Human Rights in convening four workshops with parliamentarians and senators on child rights issues. Training on child protection and early marriage was provided to senators and parliamentarians, to equip them with knowledge on the development of child-friendly policies.  Concrete recommendations were identified for follow-up by all key stakeholders.
To support the launch of Generation-Unlimited, UNICEF mapped the private sector landscape in Burundi. An initial meeting convened by UNICEF gathered 19 leaders from the private sector, government, youth organizations and development partners. In 2022, UNICEF Burundi will expand engagement with the private sector through the roll-out of the Business for Results capacity-building programme, which will help identify programmatic areas where UNICEF can collaborate most effectively with the private sector. 
 
The relevance of innovation and digital technology to fragile contexts 

UNICEF Burundi is developing an electronic platform for COVID-19 testing and vaccination. This new digital- application will monitor vaccinations and testing in real time, contributing to better adherence to vaccination and enabling adequate follow-up actions if needed.
The COVID-19 pandemic challenged UNICEF to find the best strategy for sustained delivery of the skills development programme and behaviour change communications ensuring programmatic quality and efficiency. RapidPro was used for real-time data collection and mass communication with targeted end-users; 56,000 beneficiaries of the Merankabandi cash transfer programme received messages about financial management and maternal and child health.  In addition, a nationwide U-Report enrollment campaign registered 68,000 adolescents and young people (a 75% increase), allowing them to voice their concerns and receive life-saving information. 
UNICEF explored blended learning approaches to increase adolescent learning opportunities. In collaboration with partners, the curriculum was digitized, compiled a wide range of additional digital learning materials, making them available through preloaded SD cards accessible at youth centres via 1,000 tablets. 
To promote community-driven innovation, UNICEF supported partners to fast-track the adaptation and scale-up of Upshift from 25 adolescents in 2019 to 54,444 in 10 provinces in 2021. UpShift equips adolescents with skills to identify community issues and collaboratively design innovative solutions. 
Furthermore, UNICEF has adopted an innovative and sustainable approach focused on increasing resilience to address recurrent natural disasters response in the WASH sector in the areas of Gatumba and Maramvya Sobel and in schools nation-wide."
ESAR,Comoros,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Having impacted UNICEF activities across all sectors, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in both lessons learned and innovative ideas in 2021. 
Overall, lessons learned from the previous country programme highlight the need to address low social indicators for the most vulnerable, mainly those located in rural areas, and to reinforce support for Government efforts to reduce persistent inequalities that impede the realization of child rights. Socio-cultural determinants and unfavourable family practices are persistent bottlenecks. Other lessons learned demonstrate the significant potential for scaling up innovations, expanding private sector partnerships and reinforcing youth engagement to accelerate results. It will also be critical to continue promoting multisectoral, integrated approaches to WASH, nutrition and birth registration, as well as the COVID-19 response.
Given restrictions on public gatherings, many field interventions were conducted by going door-to-door to reach beneficiaries. Even though this approach met the intended targets in some cases (e.g., more than 94 per cent of the children under 5 years old targeted received vitamin A supplementation), it also had limitations given the associated high human resource, financial, time and logistics requirements. Thus, with the implementation of the new CPD, UNICEF Comoros will seek alternative solutions to maintain access to beneficiaries in an efficient and sustainable way. 
Due to challenges facing the education sector in general, the Ministry of Education (MoE) was unable to implement many annual workplan activities for almost two months, except for pandemic-related efforts. However, MoE–UNICEF action plan activities that were set for direct UNICEF implementation and had start-up agreements could continue. 
Based on lessons learned in 2021, identifying synergies between sectors is an effective basis for carrying out intersectional efforts. For instance, to disseminate cross-sectoral key messages on good child development and parental guidance, UNICEF built on events and campaigns that had been planned in connection with these themes or resorted to existing platforms as a conduit.
The intersectionality between the protection and inclusion components of the UNICEF Comoros 2015–2021 programme allowed for the implementation of joint activities to support the reintegration of teenage mothers into school, including with UNICEF-funded tuition fees and school supplies. The success in the 2021 baccalaureate exam of three young girls who were victims of violence and subsequently received support for their socio-economic reintegration, demonstrates the potential of similar children if given due support. It is therefore important to strengthen related support initiatives, including through awareness-raising sessions for children and parents that draw on past successes. UNICEF will continue to advocate with national authorities to ensure that this type of initiatives is prioritized in the management of PF4C. Senior Ministry of Finance, Budget and Banking officials have showed a clear interest in working with UNICEF in this area from 2022 onwards.
The involvement of adolescents in the effort to curb violence against children and women has made it possible to reach those who are 11–17 years, the age group most affected by violence. Thanks to the involvement of community-based associations, UNICEF-supported activities aiming to prevent violence against children had increased visibility through social networks.
In the area of communication, some interesting innovations were tested with UNICEF Comoros technical expertise and support. These included community engagement efforts to promote COVID-19 vaccination using the stimulate, appreciate, learn and transfer (SALT) method; exploration of the social and behavioural determinants of COVID-19 vaccine attitudes; implementation of a system for monitoring information and rumours disseminated via social, community and national media platforms. These approaches and interventions should now be an integral part of any future social and behaviour change emergency response activities.
Within the framework of risk communication and community engagement and social and behaviour change strategies, the establishment of young reporter clubs was a notable programming innovation in 2021. For the first time in the Comoros, a national programme was established involving adolescents from 14–20 years. Going forward, these young people will play a leading role in their communities by producing radio broadcasts on subjects of a social nature that are likely to improve the population’s knowledge or to generate its interest on issues such as climate change, health, education and child protection.

ESAR,Eritrea,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Implementation of the new country programme cycle is to commence in 2022, with a central focus on strengthening elements of all systems capable of generating a significant impact on child outcomes. Based on lessons learned, UNICEF will continue to promote the institutionalization of community-delivered services within social service systems, with a special focus on community-integrated management of acute malnutrition, community-led total sanitation to achieve open defecation-free status, engaging community workers/volunteers to lead local-level dialogue and action to reduce FGM and child marriage, community-based early learning and the training of front-line health workers (barefoot doctors) who provide basic services to the hardest-to-reach populations. 

UNICEF will build on opportunities for innovation that have emerged throughout the pandemic, such as– the use of offline digital interactive information-sharing platforms, as accelerators of change particularly strengthening community-based social behaviour and communication platforms. An Android application, developed by four young innovators that the Government in partnership with UNICEF engaged, was installed at 120 health facilities, and uploaded onto mobile phones of over 3,000 frontline workers, school teachers and health facility staff, providing them access to the latest and user-friendly COVID-19 information on public health social measures.  A three-minute video, developed in the four local languages facilitated the training of health facility staff, teachers, and other community workers to operate and use the application. Through a pool of frontline workers in communities, in schools and at health facilities, an estimated 1.5 million population was reached with correct information that was remotely updated. Building on this initiative, UNICEF plans to strengthen the capacity of technicians and health workers and support the MoH to establish a digital media unit to coordinate MoH-led digital innovations.
 
Though services are provided to children with disability through the community rehabilitation programmes, the country office notes that there is a lack of data on children with disabilities in other programme areas and there is a need to focus on capacity building of implementing partners to collect disability disaggregated data. The new country programme should also be intentional in reaching children with disabilities and targeting them with specific interventions where necessary. In addition, collaboration and partnership with organisations of Persons with Disabilities should be pursued to ensure that programmes are designed on the principle of meaningful participation and delivered on the principle of leaving no one behind.
 
Recognizing the gaps in recent and reliable data, UNICEF will collaborate with the UN County Team, to support the strengthening of government capacity to collect, analyze, monitor and use data on the situation of children, including those living in poverty. Collaboration with the National Statistics Office will be expanded to gather, analyze and produce data on multidimensional child poverty and gender-based inequalities
"
ESAR,"ESARO, Kenya",Lessons Learned and Innovations,"ESARO complemented the finalization of Phase II of the real-time assessment of UNICEF’s country-level COVID-19 response by compiling a Compendium of Select 2020–2021 COVID-19 Response Lessons Learned. The Compendium was framed and articulated around just five of the several strategic-level learning themes in line with the 2022–2025 ROMP, namely: (1) systems strengthening; (2) innovation and technology for development; (3) public and private partnerships; (4) resilience and risk preparedness; and (5) child rights advocacy. Key 2021 lessons are therefore herein summarized according to these themes.    
 
System strengthening consistently emerged as a priority concern and major task for ESARO. With the pandemic, systems were not permitted to operate, or were found to be insufficiently equipped or funded to sustain sorely needed services. COVID-19 revealed underlying vulnerabilities and gaps in local systems and professional workforces, while compelling caregivers to become first responders for children. Key Compendium findings highlighted that: (1) ESARO sections needed to work together as sectoral efforts must be woven together to address systemic gaps; (2) local sourcing (ranging from supplies to human resources and beyond) had to be made more responsive, relevant and sustainable; (3) ESARO technical guidance needed to be simplified and delivered via practical tools rather than academic top-level guidance; and (4) rapid, real-time data on community realities could be significantly strengthened. 
 
These lessons were already reflected in ESARO’s actions in 2021: ESARO supported COs to strengthen community platforms in mitigating and responding to the pandemic in a more holistic and coordinated approach, while public finance and social protection (Cash Plus) work was accelerated. National coordination for supply and logistics and exploration of local markets were critical as ESARO provided undivided technical guidance and support to countries to participate in COVAX. Context-specific simplifications to treatment protocols for severe wasting were sustained and, as a result, access to treatment expanded in 2021. The year also saw further acceleration of community feedback mechanisms that provided real-time data and analysis on how people perceived and responded to COVID-19 vaccination, as well as information and misinformation, and helped ESARO design its response. 
 
Innovation and technology for development,including the use of digital platforms, provided invaluable lessons and opportunities. The aforementioned acceleration of community feedback mechanisms was driven by technology and its ability to scale such efforts. The potential of future digital platforms is immense in terms of how ESAR could strengthen feedback and accountability. Support to COs on e-training options continued to be expanded by ESARO, with the largest scale occurring in education, both for teachers through training to use digital curricula and for students through the digital learning toolkit. ESARO also promoted the use of digital options to facilitate early capture of evidence and lessons and help rapid cross-learning and knowledge management. ESARO introduced a variety of information-sharing options to leverage learning among the region’s 21 COs. The remaining challenge will be how ESARO can support making digital options inclusive and equitable in a region that still faces internet penetration constraints and limited access among disadvantaged groups. 
 
Public and private partnerships at the regional level continued to be crucial elements of ESARO’s CO support strategy. The Compendium validated existing collaboration/networking models and recognized the value of new partnership models. ESARO observed that while most schools reopened in 2021 and many children returned to school, adequate learning still did not take place. To invest sufficiently in the preparedness and resilience of education systems to face future shocks and ensure continued learning for all children, ESARO focused on establishing and strengthening global and regional partnerships with the likes of those previously mentioned and others, like EdTech Hub—a global research partnership. ESARO deepened its conversations around partnerships with academic institutions. For example, to advance evidence in HIV, ESARO initiated twinning of regional academic institutions with organizations and universities from the Global North, thereby enriching the substance of work and contributing to sustainability. Inter-agency partnerships around specific agendas, such as SRHR and gender, were valuable not only because of shared financial and human resources but also given their impact vis-à-vis stronger advocacy, improvements in the policy environment and scale up of integrated services. As earlier mentioned, private sector partnership was also an important 2021 results area in collaboration with entities like Airtel Africa and LIXIL.
 
Resilience and risk preparedness drew particular attention in the context of the pandemic. The Compendium highlighted several observations: (1) Community platforms can provide a more holistic response; (2) risk-informed/shock-responsive programming in UNICEF is not sufficiently apparent, despite general agreement that it is essential for improved preparedness; and (3) UNICEF needs to ensure the new capacities and skills gained by UNICEF and partners during the COVID-19 response are not lost when attention turns to recovery and beyond. Based on key emergency responses in the region in 2021, ESARO observed that UNICEF offices faced significant difficulties mobilizing non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that were not present in the emergency zones. It is important to prepare small local NGOs to be effective implementers of humanitarian response and maximize partnership with local civil protection movements and national Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies; while reliant on country-level action, ESARO can encourage these efforts. Emergency experience continued to affirm the need to reinforce COs’ risk-informed programming. Especially, gaps in preparedness to address gender inequality led ESARO to engage with numerous partners to ensure gender-related risk mitigation and response in the future.
 
High-profile engagement in child rights advocacy continues to be of utmost importance to ESARO and ESAR COs, including in terms of securing continued public commitment to the pandemic response for children. The Compendium pointed out that while large contributions have already been pledged for the coming years, resources have yet to be fully secured for recovery in the region, including for children. ESARO will continue its efforts in high-level advocacy on child rights and engage with partners, cognizant of increasing challenges in readiness to protect children’s rights in the face of the unpredictability of the pandemic and climate-induced disasters. 

"
ESAR,Eswatini,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"As previously mentioned, Eswatini experienced instances of civil unrest in 2021 that resulted in temporary disruptions of some services, as well as the death of, injury to, and detention of several children. The unrest triggered a need for more conflict sensitivity analysis and programming by the United Nations overall, which UNICEF spearheaded in terms of advocacy and adjustments of its programming. Also, with ESARO support, UNICEF Eswatini initiated staff training programmes to ensure required emergency response capacity was in place. The Office will also continue to monitor the situation beyond the framework of child rights to prepare itself further and to be able to respond to any possible sudden changes in the context that might affect children and women going forward. In general, the Office will continue to increase its capacity both in terms of knowledge and skills, as well as tools and systems for improved response.
Moreover, the pandemic and civil unrest further highlighted the importance of ensuring the availability of reliable and routine data. UNICEF will therefore increase its efforts to improve data management and reporting systems and ensure that the ongoing programmes in these areas are completed. In addition to internal capacity development, the Office will engage with partners around developing emergency preparedness capacity in terms of improved coordination; ensuring routine data collection in some critical fields, such as child protection; and strengthening service delivery in areas that could benefit from greater focus, such as psychosocial support and mental health. 
The COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on disruption of some services that have been traditionally provided in person and the need for continuity of those services highlighted the criticality of innovations in conducting business, such as digital solutions to enable virtual service provision and online data collection. In the reporting period, the Office considerably increased investment in areas such as distance education; different means of delivery (e.g., radio programmes, digital content); online systems of data collection and information management (e.g., e-Register and the Health Alert app); and online delivery of critical and life-saving information (e.g., health, psychosocial support, mental health, monitoring). Using a technology-based approach to service provision can pose challenges, such as for those with low access to technology and the related equity issues, as well as related to weak infrastructure and the high cost of initial capital investment. In the coming year, UNICEF will focus on developing solutions for these challenges, such as leveraging private sector resources.
As mentioned previously, human resource gaps and coordination challenges caused vaccination roll-out delays. To support the Government in this area, UNICEF engaged civil society organizations and the private sector, offering capacity development support to strengthen service delivery. The engagement of Business Eswatini in vaccination campaigns and involving a local bank in communication campaigns are good examples of such partnerships in 2021. Learning from these successful experiences, the Office will invest more in taking a structured and sustainable approach to forging partnerships with the private sector in Eswatini. 
In 2021, UNICEF Eswatini sought partnerships with some non-traditional partners, such as faith-based organizations and unions (e.g., SNAT) to amplify advocacy. Considering the good outcome of these partnerships, the Office will invest more time and resources in building trust and partnerships with influential groups in the country to ensure advocacy for child rights is maximized.

ESAR,Ethiopia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons Learned 
The challenges associated with the humanitarian situation in northern Ethiopia were also opportunities to learn valuable lessons in adaptive programming as seen in three examples from health, nutrition and social protection.  
 
Given mass destruction of and damage to health facilities in 2021, the health sector was one of those most seriously affected by the ramifications of the conflict in northern Ethiopia. This underscored the need for adaptive health policy during a crisis. UNICEF exercised this needed flexibility through its health service delivery approach, utilizing MHNTs to sustain the provision of life-saving essential supplies and newborn and child health and nutrition services. As conditions allowed, MHNTs were also useful in the efforts to resume services at conflict-affected health facilities. While MHNTs have proven valuable in pre-2021 emergency and development contexts, 2021 affirmed the importance of continued investment in flexible health approaches to save the lives of children and women and indicated the value in exploring even more flexible programming. 
 
UNICEF’s full-scale rapid nutrition response during the humanitarian crisis in northern Ethiopia resulted in the important lesson that it is critical to always remain ready and open to reviewing the organization’s operational approaches and plans to ensure adaptability and timely results for children, and to employ numerous complementary strategies to solve problems. In 2021, UNICEF application of these lessons proved beneficial in several instances. For example, when it became necessary to shorten service delivery times, UNICEF resolved supply and logistics issues by establishing a strategically located warehouse to enable fast onward distribution to conflict-affected areas. In addition, UNICEF developed a simplified emergency protocol for wasting treatment in partnership with MoH that is being piloted to handle multiple emergencies across Ethiopia. Faced with an overstretched ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) pipeline, UNICEF used unearmarked grants to procure RUTF and advocated for domestic resourcing. At the same time, UNICEF also launched a find-and-treat campaign, which included intense mobilization of trained MHNTs to undertake a wide variety of nutrition response activities, including at household-level, within communities affected by damaged and non-functional health posts and centres.
 
UNICEF drew valuable experience from using the traditional banking system as a tool to overcome constraints in disbursing cash transfers to IDP households in Amhara, serving as an example of repurposing an approach used in non-emergency times to deliver results during a crisis. Because of the intensifying conflict, UNICEF worked with the Government to set up bank accounts for selected IDPs, allowing them to receive cash transfers if further displaced. Going forward, this emergency contingency can be used to financially assist the growing number of IDP families trapped in zones of conflict to buy food and other essential items.
 
Innovations
A major innovation attained in 2021 was the production of egg powder through private sector partnership with the aim of improving the food system and increasing dietary diversity in Ethiopia. The production activity’s first phase focused on supporting private sector collaboration, leveraging technology to address dietary gaps, creating demand for healthier diets and increasing the supply of affordable, safe and nutritious food. If found effective, this will provide a window of opportunity for the private sector to engage in areas where markets may not yet exist or function adequately, while simultaneously strengthening international assistance. Keeping prices affordable while using environmentally friendly packaging is one of the key anticipated challenges. As a way forward, UNICEF plans to work with relevant experts to develop an egg powder business plan to further pilot and scale-up the innovation. 
 
To address the education and child protection needs in northern Ethiopia, UNICEF implemented the innovative Bete programming approach, which integrated for the first time in the country accelerated learning, protection and skills and opened the way to Education and Social Affairs scaled partnership on  Mental Health and Psychosocial support, including for IDPs and refugees children. 
 
The year in review offered significant opportunities for programming evolution and learning. UNICEF Ethiopia will continue to innovate and reflect on the lessons learned in 2021 to inform programming in 2022. 
 
 

"
ESAR,Kenya,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The situational analysis conducted to inform the design of next country programme, identified the need to intensify UNICEF’s efforts to strengthen the county-level policies for both boys and girls, in alignment with approved national legislation/policies, guidelines and plans. Because of rapid urbanization, and the unique vulnerabilities of children and families in informal settlements, UNICEF’s programming in Kenya needs to better reflect tailored approaches for urban poor and vulnerable women and adolescents, where appropriate. In 2021, there were disruptions in the HIV commodity supply chain which impacted programmes and people. Close monitoring, communication and early action with partners will be key to avoid this in the future. 

Two noteworthy innovations in 2021 include the UNICEF supported Youth Advisory Champions for Health (YACHs) and the Last Mile Framework for eMTCT (elimination of mother to child transmission of HIV). The YACHs are groups of some 25 adolescent girls and boys and young women and men aged 15-24 years under the county health departments. Through YACHs, adolescents’ and young peoples' voices can be heard in different advocacy and policy forums at county and national levels. Leveraging technology, YACHs are being mobilized to use their networks to make a big social marketing push for HIV-prevention messaging, HIV-testing products like self-testing kits, psychosocial counseling, and life-skills education. 

The Last Mile Framework is a data-driven process for eMTCT that provides a roadmap for programmes seeking to evaluate and systematically optimize the maternal and child health services at national and subnational levels. This framework can be used to structure and facilitate discussions that help programmes identify gaps at national and subnational levels and prioritize evidence-based policies and interventions. While in its early stages, there is positive engagement from national partners.  

To ensure that investments in innovations are prioritized to address core challenges for children, an innovation and T4D governance framework was set up. This brings in both programme and operations teams for better integration, strategic guidance, and value for money in investments. The office’s innovations are reflected in UNICEF’s innovation platform INVENT for enhanced global portfolio management of innovations.

UNICEF successfully lobbied and advocated with the State Department for Youth Affairs, stakeholders, and young people to launch U-Report under the brand name Yunitok. A national steering committee co-chaired by the State Department for Youth Affairs and UNICEF was established to provide governance and oversight. Yunitok has generated keen interest and reached close to 60,000 young people, (53 per cent girls), across all counties in Kenya. Through Yunitok, the voices of children and young people were included in the study of the situation of children, that will inform the next UNICEF country programme. The platform was also used for the Food Systems Summit. 

UNICEF has continued to expand the Youth Market Place (YOMA) – a digital platform focused on helping young people transition from learning to work, unlocking opportunities for youth. More than 5,700 young people in Kenya have created trusted profiles, accessed personalized training opportunities, and engaged in community service involving, cleaning schools and their communities, greening initiatives, and providing mentorship to others. 

Progress has been made on scaling up last-mile connectivity for public primary schools. In 2021, UNICEF connected an additional 100 schools, up from the 10 schools connected in 2020. This work has leveraged government investment in digital learning through the digital literacy project and is informing connectivity scale-up under the Kenya National Broadband Strategy for all schools. Numerous private sectors partners were screened and now available through long-term agreements to connect schools in all geographical areas in Kenya. 

Moving away from issue-based engagements, in 2021, UNICEF entered in a strategic partnership with Inter-Religious Council of Kenya (IRCK), a coalition of all major faith communities in Kenya, which proved to be an effective way to engage communities’ social norms that expose girls and boys to harmful practices like FGM and child marriage. This partnership was effective in accelerating the uptake of COVID-19 vaccinations and was marked by a national advocacy event in December, during which MoH and top religious leaders called on Kenyans to get vaccinated. 

COVID-19 continued to be a major challenge in 2021. UNICEF applied both remote and onsite review of assurance activities, which saw UNICEF exceed the minimum required financial and programatic assurance activities. To enhance efficiency in supply management, the mobile Warehouse Inventory Management System (mWIMs) was rolled out to the field offices, ensuring third-party warehouse staff were held accountable as the system captures data in real-time and reduces errors in stock counting.

A leadership development programme was implemented for all supervisors and the Country Management Team by evaluating skills gaps identified from the GSS/ITF/Pulse survey. In addition, a working group reviewed the GSS/ITF/Pulse survey results and monitored agreed actions to improve staff well-being. To enhance working environments, outdoor meeting spaces were created in zonal offices, personal protective equipment was provided to all UNICEF staff and data bundles offered to those who faced connectivity challenges.

"
ESAR,Lesotho,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF continued to adapt and adjust programmes in response to challenges posed by COVID-19. Despite the lockdown and limited movement due to the COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF adopted innovative approaches to delivering services, including online remote workshops, using ICT to reach children, adolescents, and communities. UNICEF has supported key meetings to move to virtual platforms, including for COVID-19 coordination meetings, technical working groups, validation of PMTCT guidelines, and care and services for neo-natal care services. Communication with partners was maintained through remote meetings and regular calls. In addition, other platforms such as social media and radio were used to encourage mothers and caregivers on health services utilization.
 
As part of adapting in the health sector, UNICEF leveraged COVID-19 funds allocated for emergency supply and logistics to strengthen routine immunization, which has been neglected while the country focuses on COVID-19 vaccination.

UNICEF deployed the use of U-Report to improve the effectiveness of programmes and ensure public engagement and feedback. U-Report has enabled young people and hard-to-reach groups to access information and voice issues that matter to them. In 2021, U-Report proved helpful in collecting data for studies (e.g., regional nutrition and COVID-19 studies) or for quick feedback from beneficiaries (e.g., horizontal and vertical expansion of cash transfer U-report polls). The results of these polls have highlighted the effectiveness of real-time, qualitative feedback in strengthening programme delivery.
 
While schools reopened in 2021, learning recovery continues to be a challenge and offers a critical lesson on the need to have alternate learning modalities to complement in-school learning. UNICEF leads advocacy with education partners for a comprehensive education strategy that combines school-based learning with online and self-learning materials. This is expected to build resilient education systems. The strategy also utilized online teaching and learning for student teachers, thereby avoiding a backlog of students repeating a year. UNICEF supported MOET to establish the Learning Passport, an online platform to ensure learning continuity and curriculum-based learning materials and modules have been uploaded. UNICEF continued to work with organizations of persons with disabilities, especially LNFOD, on inclusive education and disability programming.  Partnerships to address remote teaching and learning challenges and develop offline learning opportunities needs to be strengthened. 
  
COVID-19 crisis provided an opportunity to strengthen the social protection system and its shock-responsiveness by increasing coverage of beneficiaries in the mainstream programmes. It was unexpected, but the crisis presented an opportunity that UNICEF seized. UNICEF’s years of support and close relationship with MoSD allowed us to respond to their evolving needs and concerns. The involvement of key Government stakeholders reflects in the strategic documents to enhance integrated social safety nets and improve shock-responsive social protection. They reflect the currently existing challenges and address actual needs. The need to continue to expand mobile payment methods for social protection was revealed as COVID-19 and lockdown posed challenges to in-person delivery of grants.

While supporting efforts to improve Public Finance for Children, we learned that it is important to hold consultations for the next fiscal year budget well in advance so that citizen-views can be meaningfully reflected in the budget documents as well, holding regular (remote) meetings to discuss and solve issues regarding the annual work plan has been very instrumental in assuring implementation of activities. Finally, building trust and nurturing good relationships with key ministries, such as Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Planning remained the key to a successful collaboration for this area of work. 

The M&E SitAn provided insight on the Lesotho Statistical System, and we learned that this needs to be modernized by digitalizing its process and methods. In addition, the CO successfully migrated to the Cloud for all infrastructure and used an always-on VPN, which enhanced faster access to Vision and UNICEF apps for Lesotho staff.

The COVID-19 emergency has changed living and working patterns, which led to a reflection on traditional work, what it means to be part of a country team and office and how to work with government and partners. 
 
As UNICEF took a prominent and visible role in vaccine procurement and delivery as well as key pillars in the response, we learned the importance of working in partnership (in this case, hand-in-hand with WHO) and creating tools and dashboards that would support effective government coordination and sharing of information among partners. With regular changes in government leadership (four different Ministers of Health since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic), UNICEF senior management took time to engage and nurture relationships with key government technical directors, as well as PS’s and Ministers. With this approach, UNICEF very quickly established itself as a key “go-to” partner and leader in the COVID response and recovery efforts.
 
For the CO, the emergence of a “new normal” of remote and hybrid working, remote monitoring, and remote guidance and tools have been critical. Lesotho CO has stayed and delivered in difficult circumstances. Throughout this several lessons were learned – it is important to be flexible and adopt and support (including financially) virtual tools for staff and partners if programme implementation is to succeed; using a range of methods to communicate is critical (email, phone calls, text messaging, WhatsApp, mail polls, virtual meetings) and developing, training staff and using electronic work systems contributes to programme continuity, quality assurance, enhanced coordination, and good monitoring of programmes. 
 
Providing flexibility to staff, prioritizing duty of care of team members, encouraging discussions among supervisors and teams on accountabilities, partnering as senior management and staff association and providing platforms to discuss, share and support each other have helped strengthen the team spirit of the CO and helped diminish stress and anxiety. 
"
ESAR,Madagascar,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons Learned
At the final year of a country programme cycle, UNICEF had a valuable opportunity to assess lessons learned and innovations. The lessons and the need for such lessons were accentuated by the humanitarian situations faced by Madagascar and its children during the year.
First, UNICEF Madagascar’s consistent positioning on climate change and environment began to gain traction among donors, for example, around the WASH eco-village concept, and satellite mapping of water sources. UNICEF advocated to bring together social and environmental concerns, which had been two separate and siloed sectors in Madagascar.  With increased appreciation and understanding of the complex linkages between the environmental conservation/climate change efforts and those of development programming for child well-being, UNICEF Madagascar initiated several new interventions to address children’s concerns at this confluence: for example, UNICEF procured air pollution monitors for widespread use; implemented a joint programme on child protection issues around vanilla production; and produced a study on the impact of mining mica on children in their communities. 
The importance of supporting the country’s deconcentration and strengthening the accountability of regional authorities has been reemphasized as an important lesson for UNICEF, especially since these remain among key bottlenecks to effective programme delivery.  For example, efforts to mobilize communities can be fragile, costly, short lived and un-replicable, if pilots are set up without explicit vision for the regional governments to scale-up and sustain them.  An increased and formalized field presence of four new field offices, in the new country programme, with a more senior, technically oriented team, is an important step to supporting progressively stronger local capacity and sustainability.
 
Innovations
In 2021, UNICEF Madagascar finalized and launched an end-user supply monitoring (EUSM) tool in some regions, a system allowing UNICEF staff to check whether distributed supplies had arrived as planned, were in correct working order, and were used appropriately by the intended end user. Using an Android application with geolocation capabilities, the EUSM tool identifies nearby service points and displays inventory of supplies which have been delivered. This innovative system responded to a clear information gap for UNICEF in the country and will be put to scale in 2022.  The EUSM allows any staff members to undertake monitoring of supplies across sectors, including by UNICEF drivers, while strengthening supply chains, especially in nutrition, WASH and health.
Involving consultations with 175 people and implementing partners, UNICEF prequalified partners for WASH community mobilization projects along entities that agreed to contribute to the investment and management of the constructed WASH infrastructures.  This arrangement saved time and reduced contractual challenges, especially for the drought response in the south, including the World Bank-led US$23 million support to rehabilitate 600 boreholes.
In-house, UNICEF Madagascar introduced new approaches to help rationalize staff field trips with results delivery as core purpose.  For example, missions from Antananarivo to rural areas, especially in a COVID-19 context, require investment in staff time and financial resources, while possibly disrupting field-based colleagues’ workplans, if not planned carefully.  A new field mission validation tool was introduced to help prioritize trips and ensure that field staff time and logistical capacity are first dedicated to the implementation of activities. In addition, UNICEF introduced the concept of a virtual visit in 2021, where virtual visitors were guided, for example, through a primary school and a nutrition site in Androy region over Zoom. The virtual option had the benefit of much lower cost, less staff time and many more participants to the trip, overall a hugely positive experience for all concerned. 
In 2022, the Madagascar country office will continue to address the drought in the south and support the response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic while ensuring preparedness for other possible natural disasters.

"
ESAR,Malawi,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Against the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF Malawi scaled up efforts to explore adaptive programming and innovative approaches including remote monitoring of programmes and joint resource mobilization aimed at sustaining continuity of essential services while dealing with the COVID-19 preparedness, response and recovery.  Through our internal pillar coordination and structure,  based on the life-cycle approach, UNICEF Malawi continued to jointly mobilize resources through ongoing UN partnerships and donor coordination, within the framework of the country office resource mobilization strategy and recently established a resource mobilization task force.  Together with other UN entities, UNICEF Malawi has also tapped into SDG acceleration funds.
 
COVID-19 resources were used as a strategic opportunity to leverage investment in strengthening routine systems and programmes including immunization, oxygen supply, newborn care and infection, prevention and control services in health facilities.
   
In the WASH sector, the main lessons were around the definition of different financing solutions to bring the country back on track for the achievement of SDG6. The UNICEF SDG costing tool revealed the huge financial resources required to meet the sector goals, providing a lesson that the sector requires to work on different financial solutions to make timely progress each year. 
 
Lessons learnt from the evaluation of UNICEF’s work on cash transfer programming in emergencies have led to increased advocacy efforts with a focus on harmonized e-payments, the improvement of targeting mechanisms and coordination across the humanitarian-development nexus. Greater efforts were made to build Government’s capacity, including at district level, for instance by supporting the development and roll-out of an innovative tool enabling Malawi’s national social protection system to be horizontally expanded for the first time. The collaboration with UN sister agencies on cash transfers in emergencies has also been improved, including with a Joint UNICEF-WFP Annual Workplan and a joint position paper on Shock-Sensitive Social Protection (forthcoming).
 
UNICEF’s direct engagement on the COVID-19 cash response included the establishment of a call centre for grievance and redress mechanisms and monitoring activities. This emergency call centre is now being transitioned into a permanent national structure with added functionalities and the capacity to provide support to development programmes. 

The use of innovative and pioneering approaches by integrating art-forms into research dissemination strengthened participatory learning among youth and academia. Over 80 students directly participated and hundreds of others attended the research dissemination workshop. During the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(Drones) summative evaluation and developmental evaluation, the participatory and consultative processes involving all programmes and key stakeholders proved instrumental to promote involvement, ownership and responsiveness as well as development of relevant and user-friendly knowledge products. 
 
The real time evaluation of the COVID-19 response identified the engagement of UNICEF’s supply section in the support and facilitation of the global supply portal to stakeholders in Malawi as a good practice.  This mechanism will benefit the aid community and government bodies in the event of a global threats that challenges the availability of supplies. An additional lesson stems from the diversification of supplies through local procurement; consolidating relations with local producers and suppliers will be key in future situations of shortage of global supplies.
 
Although UNICEF got overwhelming positive media coverage, there were always reputational risks. UNICEF’s increasingly visible role in the COVID-19 response and delivery of vaccines posed such risks with shipping challenges being attributed to UNICEF. UNICEF responded swiftly and in an agile manner with public statements, responses, and proactive communication with Government and Development Partners.  


The summative evaluation of the impact of using drones on health and other outcomes recommended that when advocating and fundraising for and designing innovation initiatives, UNICEF must adopt a child-centred and problem-first approach, in other words, what humanitarian or development challenge we want to solve to improve the well-being of children, rather than a technology-first, solution-driven method. With this mindset shift, the office decided to integrate drones and data technologies into relevant multi-sectoral programmes (e.g. health supply chain, and aerial mapping for disaster planning and response). A further useful recommendation was that UNICEF should design and undertake projects that promote the continuation and scale-up of drones, while conducting studies on its cost effectiveness and sustainability. These programmes must specifically have  deliverables on data, transparency and cost analysis across all aspects of production, use, implementation, adoption, integration and post-project effects or impacts. 
 
The key lessons learnt from the Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn and Child Health evaluation on the Quality of Care Project in five high burden districts is the value of deploying Quality Improvement Teams within the health facilities combined with the use of score cards,  which enabled feedback mechanisms within communities to raise their concerns and inputs on their health service experiences.

UNICEF Malawi has tested, scaled and adopted several high-impact innovations in 2021 in close collaboration with young people. Some of the key achievements on the innovation front included the Intelligent Community Health Information System, and the work through the African Drone and Data Academy which has equipped 440 young people from 25 African countries with 21st century skills.
 
UNICEF Malawi is currently supporting the Ministry of Education with internet connectivity to promote its readiness to use digital technologies to ensure learning in line with the global initiative of reimagining education. Digital solutions also contribute to strategies aimed to increase girls’ access to secondary education through open, distance education and electronic learning.

The country office reviewed its disability programming in 2021. Starting with work planning for 2022. The office reflected that whilst work is being done oinm inclusive education, there is further room to  prioritize disability focused interventions, capacity strengthening of implementing partners on disability disaggregated data collection as well as establishing strong partnerships with disability oriented organizations.
"
ESAR,Namibia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"National leadership is important for ownership. The NaMPI analysis was well entrenched and led by the Government ensuring ownership of the findings. The Director General of National Planning Commission (NPC) launched the Report and presented the same, at the 76th UN General Assembly, expressing the Government’s commitment to the measure, as an official permanent poverty statistic for informing national policies and tracking progress in Namibia. Through the series of meetings convened by UNICEF with Government Ministries, International Financial Institutions, Development Partners and Natcoms, it was clear that awareness of the NaMPI Report was low, albeit several months after its launch. By strategically packaging the report findings and presenting to different stakeholders, UNICEF was able to ensure wider awareness of the child poverty situation and its implications on children themselves, the society and national development. Further, the dissemination meetings helped to galvanize Government and Partners to strengthen partnerships and collaboration for a Big Push on policies and programmes aimed at reducing child poverty in all its dimensions as articulated in SDG1. It was through these advocacy efforts that UNICEF was able to obtain Government commitment to include child multidimensional poverty indicators and targets in the NDP6.
 
During rainy season, annual floods on the Zambezi River make roads inaccessible for 6 months of the year and cut off communities from access to vital health and laboratory diagnostic services such as HIV testing and routine immunization and COVID vaccination. UNICEF together with Government, the private sector and Johns Hopkins University, therefore initiated the establishment of the first-of-its-kind medical drone corridor to transport and deliver specimen samples, vaccines, and other medical commodities. The drone network will consist of one hub, that will act as a landing, maintenance, and recharging center and support five clinic sites with one trip per weekday to each clinic site, i.e. facilitating over 1000 flights per year starting in 2022 thereby improving the lives of around 90,000 vulnerable people from remote communities. 
 
UNICEF is using its multi-sectoral expertise to strengthen multi-sectoral integration across different delivery platforms, improving access to services for women and children through ECD centres, community health platforms, community outreaches, schools and health facilities. These ECD support modalities will be analyzed for cost efficiency and scale-up feasibility. In partnership with InterTeam and Botnar Foundation, UNICEF provided technical support to the design of an innovative Social Impact Bond strategy to finance ECD expansion and improve quality, currently at approval stage with the Ministry of Finance, with a view to strengthen joint Government, Private Sector and Development Partners’ results-based investment in ECD. Strong understanding by the Government of the Social Impact Bond is key to ownership. 
 
To inform policy and public advocacy for sanitation expansion through CLTS, UNICEF in partnership with Development Workshop Namibia captured over 5,000 constructed toilets in urban informal settlements in a GIS platform for real-time visibility. UNICEF and DWN are jointly developing a field note on this innovative monitoring to share lessons learnt beyond Namibia. Persisting challenges requiring further innovative approaches include effective delivery of differentiated messaging and platforms to address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, strengthening data accessibility, visibility and utilization at service point and sub-national level across sectors.
 
Engagement of Government and private sector stakeholders with expertise in new information communication technologies (ICTs) resulted in increased in-house capacity, ownership and commitment within the MoEAC to accelerate access to ICTs in the basic education sector, equipping learners with essential skills to maximise opportunities in the 21st century, and thus decreasing inequities as Namibia reimagines education. This priority is clearly formulated in HPP II.
 
Furthermore, the multi-stakeholder approach of UPSHIFT, with regular interactions and updates on the progress and opportunities of the young person’s ideas and solutions, has gained interest in UPSHIFT from both Government and private sector, as a tool for closing the compatibility gap between education, including TVET, and the labour market, to be considered for improving their own interventions and corporate social responsibility investments. 
 
As UNICEF Namibia prepares to launch U-Report in 2022, Government ownership, youth mobilisation and resource-sharing is proving key to success. UNICEF maximised adolescent participation in its programmatic interventions in the development of the Safeguarding in Sports Training Manual, of the Teen Club Standardised Curriculum, of the U=U behaviour change campaign, of the Impact Study on the Policy on Prevention and Management of Learner Pregnancies, and of course as part of the human-centred design approach of UPSHIFT and U-Report. The adolescents and young persons’ feedback inspired stakeholders to commit to further improving on adolescent participation in their own work. The experience has further influenced UNICEF’s draft adolescent participation framework, which is expected to be finalised in 2022.
 
Another key lesson learnt is that strategic partnerships and forging close working relationship with the Ministry of Finance and the NPC is key to influence policy and action to deliver results. UNICEF supported the engagements between the Ministry of Gender Equality, Poverty Eradication and Social Welfare (MGEPESW) with the Ministry of Finance and NPC, at both technical and executive level, which proved pivotal in obtaining fiscal commitment and Cabinet approval of the Social Protection Policy. These relationships need to be sustained to ensure successful implementation of the Policy.
 
NCO continued to monitor the COVID-19 situation and adjusted to an evolving environment through a combination of office and teleworking modalities as part of the Business Continuity Plan. This contributed to a reduction of office footprint to ensure staff safety and wellbeing. NCO supported staff wellbeing through HR procedures, including regular days off for staff. 
 
In response to the Pulse Check and Global Staff Survey, NCO developed an action plan to address the key areas identified in the survey. A consultant was engaged to facilitate NCO efforts on racial discrimination and biases in the workplace, psychological safety and trust, and performance management. NCO is committed to sustain the implementation of the action plan in 2022. A coaching session for managers following 360 degrees assessment is scheduled to be concluded by year end. Significant resources were invested in T4D interventions including the pilot drone and U-report projects.

ESAR,Republic of Mozambique,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Informing future cooperation for children based on the findings from the evaluation of the 2017-2021 country programme 
This year, UNICEF finalised the Country Programme Evaluation (2017-2021) led by the Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Office (ESARO). The main recommendations were to (a) develop/maintain a more realistic scope and ambition of the new Country Programme 2022-2026, (b) integrate programming and geographic focus in targeted provinces, (c) enhance the life-cycle approach, and (d) strengthen the humanitarian-development-peace nexus. The new Country Programme of Cooperation between the Government of Mozambique and UNICEF for 2022-2026 was developed, giving close attention to the above recommendations. A series of discussions were held for prioritization of geographic locations at province and district levels to make meaningful convergence. Key results with specific indicators were defined to ensure cross-sectoral collaboration. Matrix management will be introduced more frequently to operationalize joint programming and monitoring. The UNICEF contribution to the North has also been better articulated with a focus on enhancing the development-humanitarian-peace nexus. UNICEF also engaged in the government drafting process of the national long-term development strategy.
Informing the programming in the north based on the findings from the learning evaluation of the Cabo Delgado response  
From July-October, UNICEF Mozambique, in coordination with UNICEF ESARO, conducted a learning-focused evaluation on the humanitarian response in Cabo Delgado.   The evaluation was conducted by the Centre for Humanitarian Change and collected data from a wide spectrum of key informants.  The evaluation focused on UNICEF’s response, innovations, challenges, and recommendations for improvements moving forward. 
Results showed that UNICEF had developed excellent relationships with the government, successfully mobilized support for newly displaced persons through the Joint Response Programme and followed the Core Commitments for Children in Humanitarian Action (CCC) and Sphere standards as much as possible.  Areas for improvement identified were monitoring, accountability to affected populations, strengthening cluster leadership, ensuring inclusion and vulnerabilities are appropriate addressed, and thinking more strategically about targeting and reaching populations while expanding service delivery.  The evaluation provided ten recommendations which are being addressed within the new Country Programme of Cooperation and the humanitarian response plan.
Innovating for children
UNICEF’s Innovation and Technology for Development (T4D) Strategy 2022-2026, which is currently under review, sets out the framework for investigating, implementing, and scaling-up sustainable innovation and technologies. Specifically, the strategy aims to provide a framework to (a) optimize the innovation and T4D investment portfolio to focus on high-impact, scalable, and affordable solutions; (b) Identify UNICEF’s comparative advantage that informs innovation and T4D focus areas; and (b) document and disseminate lessons learned, best practices, processes, and tools, and establish a governance structure that supports the prioritization, technical support and management of the innovation and T4D portfolio.  
Since 2019, UNICEF Mozambique has invested more than US$1.5 million in several innovation and T4D solutions and implemented them to better understand and address challenges in access, delivery, and uptake of services for children. Some of these initiatives such as the civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) system are at the sustainable scale stage and the Health Information System of Mozambique for Monitoring and Evaluation (SIS-MA) and SMS BIZ have also scaled in the country. 
UNICEF’s portfolio of programme innovations and solutions include a study titled “Modelling Geographical Accessibility to Support Disaster Response and Rehabilitation of a Healthcare System: An impact analysis of Cyclones Idai and Kenneth in Mozambique.” The study, which demonstrates how geographic modelling can inform disaster response by assessing accessibility of healthcare post-disaster in terms of travel times to healthcare facilities, received a silver medal in the ‘Best of UNICEF Research 2021’. The approach may be applicable for both future disaster responses as well as for health system recovery, mitigation, and preparedness. The review panel commended this “highly innovative” research for its novel approach to risk assessment in post-disaster settings and for its high potential impact as a valuable tool that can be scaled to different humanitarian settings and enhance UNICEF’s work as a frontline organization in disaster response.
upSCALE, a Ministry of Health-led digital health system strengthening platform, shows promise to scale-up nationwide with implementation in seven out of 11 provinces. upSCALE uses real-time data collected by community health workers (CHW) to improve the management and delivery of quality community health services. The Ministry of Health has fully embedded upSCALE into the new national strategy for CHW. Nearly half of all CHWs in the country are trained in the use of the upSCALE application. New CHWs receive upSCALE training as part of their standard training curriculum; and more than 70 per cent of CHWs and 299 of their supervisors regularly use upSCALE for patient consultations. By end October 2021, a total of 339,826 patients were registered in the database.
 
UNICEF-led ‘Internet of Good Things’ — known locally as Boa Internet — has over 900,000 daily page views for nearly 300,000 subscribers and will now be available for free (no data charges to access the website) to subscribers of Vodacom mobile communications company."
ESAR,Rwanda,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF’s experience in health logistics has been invaluable during the pandemic. The MOH continued to receive COVID-19 vaccine doses through COVAX, bilateral agreements and direct government procurement. UNICEF increased efforts to coordinate vaccine and syringe arrivals – including in-country distribution and delivery – and ensure that vaccines were utilized before expiry dates. UNICEF advocated that syringes be donated alongside vaccines and provided direct procurement support to mitigate syringe shortages. 
 
Strengthening disability systems and institutions requires partnerships beyond UNICEF. UNICEF, working collaboratively with partners such as GIZ, supported the National Council of Persons with Disabilities in the ongoing development of the Disability Management Information System. This innovative tool supports the identification and registry of persons with disabilities, and facilitates multisectoral service mapping, provision and reporting. It will also complement existing efforts to strengthen data and intersectoral coordination. UNICEF is already strengthening internal coordination and inclusive office practices with the reactivation of the country office Disability Taskforce. 
 
Technology and data continue to grow in importance. UNICEF contributed to the upgrade of DHIS-2 with new applications – the scorecard, a bottleneck analysis and the action tracker –to improve data visualization and analytics. These innovations were designed to improve routine MCH services, but COVID-19 interventions also benefited – everyone receiving a COVID-19 vaccine was directly registered into DHIS-2, and invitations for second doses were sent by SMS. Online correspondence and using smart phones to share progress and mentor service-providers, plus community radio, digital means such as WhatsApp groups and field-based coordinators, ensured continuity of health services during lockdowns. The community adolescent peer-led platform was also leveraged to promote COVID-19 prevention messages. 
 
The country office continually explores innovative approaches to programmatic problem solving. Breakthroughs in innovation and technology application resulted from consistent dialogue between programme sections and operations/ICT. Similar success was seen in strengthened accountabilities in HACT, owing to internal partnership and dialogue. Technology such as interactive voice response (IVR) is increasingly important, especially given the challenges of COVID-19. In response to rapid changes in the business environment, the country office has used three strategies: a ‘Solutions Team’ to develop responsive activities; using innovation and technology to leverage the thriving ICT ecosystem in Rwanda; and more efficient use of resources in a context of declining funding. By negotiating individual contracts, the office saved US$ 223,000 in 2021. 
 
Inequalities in the access and use of digital technology remain an issue. The 2019 education statistical yearbook shows that only 35 per cent of primary schools have internet connectivity and only 58 per cent of primary schools have ICT infrastructure for teaching and learning. These inequalities reduce the accessibility of opportunities for learning, employment and civic engagement. The pandemic and a move to online and blended learning has highlighted the need to accelerate investment in ICT in education and to increase digital connectivity, especially for the most marginalized students. The GIGA programme is part of the solution and 2021 saw strong government ownership of GIGA. The need for a comprehensive approach that also covers teacher training, provision of devices, and availability of content is clearly understood. 
 
The importance of working face-to-face was realised. The country office learned that, although remote working can keep things moving, learning, training, new brainstorming and building teams work best in person. A hybrid of remote and face-to-face approaches will continue in 2022, giving flexibility to staff while encouraging in-person collaboration. 
 
Dealing with the unexpected requires an agile approach. As grant agent for the Rwanda Education Sector Programme Implementation Grant, UNICEF embedded technical assistance within MINEDUC to support GPE processes. However, COVID-19 restrictions meant that some programmes had to be reimagined. In the remedial education programme (which focuses on girls) it was not possible to bring communities together to address gender norms. Re-thinking led to a switch to other media (radio and TV) to communicate messages on gender equality and gender norms. In the Learning Through Play programme, because face-to-face training sessions were delayed, agreement was reached with the government to develop videos of good teaching practice which can be used as an alternative to face-to-face training. 
 
The pandemic highlighted the lack of institutional and workforce preparedness in child protection. Efforts have been made to build more responsive and adaptive child protection systems to all types of emergencies. The main lesson learned from the pandemic is that child protection is an essential component of preparedness, response and recovery during emergencies – this lesson is being transformed into specific guidance on child protection in health emergencies. 
 
Peer-to-peer engagement among private companies and businesses is effective. UNICEF has engaged with influential businesses on sharing best practice and investment in child-friendly spaces and has piggybacked on their marketing channels to amplify COVID-19 and other critical messaging. A UNICEF-published business case for employer-supported childcare showed that such investment is not simply a social responsibility objective but can increase profits – 16 out of 19 tea companies invested over USD 300,000 in child-friendly workspaces and family-friendly policies, and childcare has been institutionalized in the contracts of all tea companies. Two mining companies are now investing in child-friendly workspaces too. Peer-to-peer learning visits have had wide influence, with rice and horticulture companies learning from the success of the tea sector. A CEO forum has been set up to bring together CEOs who share a common vision for children’s wellbeing.  
 
The medium affects the message. While the country office social media platforms have a significant and increasing following, the rate of engagement on posts remains disappointing. The local language (Kinyarwanda) will therefore be used in social media posts, and the Kinyarwanda version of the website will be regularly updated. The use of influencers on social media and other platforms is being considered in 2022.Similarly, changing the tone of a national campaign from SHISHOZA ‘Think Twice’ (instructional) to SINDOHOKA ‘I will never give up’ (individual accountability) created more trust in the government-led RCCE. And a radio partnership specifically tailored for young people (KISS FM) helps to mobilize young people as agents of change and fights 'message fatigue'. 

"
ESAR,Somalia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Goal Area 1: Every Child Survives and Thrives
The response to the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that pre-existing structures for polio vaccinations could be harnessed for district-level disease surveillance, COVID-19 vaccinations and other activities required for routine immunization. 
During the COVID-19 vaccine roll-out, efforts placed on evidence-based programmatic focus, risk communication, engagement strategies and interventions tailored for women increased the coverage of women from 25 per cent to 39 per cent of the total vaccinated population.
Building on existing programme partnerships facilitates humanitarian response and programme synergies among EPI, malaria, HIV and nutrition-related activities. UNICEF was able to implement COVID-19 interventions in a timely and holistic manner by amending existing development programme partnerships and enabling UNICEF partners to provide life-saving health services in humanitarian situations.  Early planning paired with robust coordination with the Ministry of Health and strong supply chain management are essential to mitigate the impact of public health emergencies. 
Due to limited funding, UNICEF reduced the scope of community-level interventions in 2021, which likely affected health promotion and case referral activities. Health impacts can be maximized by providing adequate support to health facilities and communities, along with approaches aiming to strengthen health systems at the district level.  
State-level Ministries of Health (MoH) were less accountable to implementation of activities and achievement of results, as work plans were signed only between UNICEF and Federal MoH. In 2021, UNICEF engaged with the Government at the national and state level in the development of Rolling Work Plans, increasing the accountability and ownership of activities by the federal and state level ministries. This engagement empowered Field Offices in the planning and implementation of nutrition activities at the state level.  
The introduction of multi-year Programme Documents (PDs) mitigated challenges related to disruption of service provision due to expiry of PDs with CSO partners and delays in preparation of PDs. UNICEF prepared 47 multi-year nutrition PDs in 2021. This will allow UNICEF and partners to prevent nutrition gaps across the country.
 
Goal Area 2: Every Child Learns
An evaluation conducted by the Ministry of Education and Higher Education in Puntland identified the limitations of a student-based cash transfer programme, with a recommendation for a shift towards school capitation grants. UNICEF provided school-based capitation grants, thus enabling a more sustainable implementation of School Improvement Plans through income generation activities. In 2022, this approach will be merged into a multi-partner Joint Programme on Local Governance to strengthen district-wide education systems. Furthermore, a Learning Passport digital learning platform with over 13,000 registered students has demonstrated how children impacted by climate- and conflict-related emergencies can be efficiently reached remotely with curriculum and co-curricular learning materials. Initially introduced as a means of mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on children’s learning, this platform has the potential to form a key component of a blended schooling approach for children living in remote rural areas. 
The Education Programme ensured the availability of real time data on children’s and teachers’ presence and participation in schools using a Rapid Pro tool on mobile phones.  This allowed for a better understanding of the impact of COVID-19 and determination of which school services were impacted the most.
Goal Area 3: Every Child is Protected from Violence and Exploitation
The social work professionalization programme is improving the quality of care across all elements of the child protection programme. Passionate young graduates have acquired professional skills in case management, counselling, social and behavioural change, legal principles, multi-sectoral service provision, social work principles and Islamic welfare principles, among others. Where graduate social workers are employed, UNICEF is witnessing creative problem-solving on difficult social issues, spontaneous case conferencing among social workers from different agencies, accountability in the case management process, documented case follow up and more generally, a level of passion and excitement for this work. Social workers are earning respect from traditional leaders, government officials, mayors, police, doctors, nurses and justice officials, who are referring more children to them and building a platform for engagement on the eradication of harmful practises. 
Goal Area 4: Every Child Lives in a Safe and Clean Environment 
Despite using the latest hydro-geological assessment technologies, UNICEF experiences difficulties in identifying successful boreholes, causing significant delays and expensive drilling operations. UNICEF deployed the Turnkey approach for borehole drilling, which offers rapid deployment and enhances the value of money invested. 
Donor support for durable solutions for emergency response is being embraced across the board, supporting new initiatives, including borehole drilling, development of multi-year Master Plans, and engagement of Public-Private Partnership companies in water supply and capacity development for WASH committees. Establishment of Regional Hubs for pre-positioning and replenishment of hygiene kit items is an approach that has worked well in the context and has put UNICEF in a good position to manage core WASH pipeline supplies. 
With continued urbanization caused by conflict and climate change, development of Government-led and multi-year Urban WASH Master Plans was useful in strengthening sector planning and effective use of resources.
Goal Area 5: Every Child has an Equitable Chance in Life 
The combination of COVID-19’s impact, along with a lengthy and difficult electoral process and donor reassessment of priorities has tested the chosen implementation strategy for the Social Policy Outcome. The dual track, with top-down approaches such as supporting cash delivery systems for MoLSA at the federal level and bottom-up approaches through local governance and decentralized service delivery, has proven to be a correct one. 
UNICEF’s engagement has followed a robust strategic analysis of where and how UNICEF adds value to government and development partners. This led UNICEF not to engage in humanitarian cash transfers, but instead focus only on building social protection systems for MoLSA, or by committing only to work on local governance as part of the JPLG.
Partnership with UN agencies through JPLG enabled UNICEF to establish a channel to engage government in the delivery of basic social services, leveraging local resources.  This has provided venues for UNICEF programmes to progressively deliver through government channels and to engage majors and district councillors      in advocating for more and better services.
"
ESAR,South Africa,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"With the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting unpredictability of the programming environment the key theme of adaptability, agility and flexibility remained relevant throughout the year. For example, the critical Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) response to COVID required an agile approach, with an ability to shift focus as the virus and vaccine roll-out evolved. When the COVID-19 vaccines opened earlier than expected for the 18- to 34-year-old age group, UNICEF quickly activated a U-Report poll to better understand youth perceptions of the vaccine, information that was fed back into the RCCE technical working group. 
 
The broader UNICEF RCCE strategy was tweaked in mid-2021 to focus specifically on youth, a group who were being missed and not actively engaged in the COVID response. U-Report proved to be a particularly effective tool in gaining rapid access to youth opinions and views, informing communication and programmatic work. The findings worked particularly well in UNICEF media work and played a key role in the scaled-up media engagement work throughout the year. The exponential rise in social media engagement was partly a result of in-kind Facebook ad credits, as well as the active and often divisive nature of comments related to COVID vaccines. 
 
UNICEF Volunteers also came into their own during the COVID response in 2021, playing a direct on the ground role in encouraging elders and their peers to get vaccinated, a new partnership with Oak Foundation and Heartlines will further scale up this work in early 2022. 
The ability to nurture and foster adaptive approaches – i.e., innovation - in line with the realities of the emergency is essential for successful programming in uncertain times. For as long as uncertainties such as brought by the lockdown regulations remain in place limiting face-to-face interactions, online training takes place. Whilst this has been mostly successful in more urban provinces with appropriate infrastructure and network connectivity to allow for these online sessions, there is a need to strengthen the digital structure to ensure that all provinces in the country can also benefit from such sessions. Unequal access to the Internet risks exacerbating existing inequalities in education and training, and this is in area that UNICEF can encourage the government to focus more on and strengthen, and this has in some ways started. Quick review of the UNICEF global Learning Passport resulted in a decision to use homegrown solutions while leaving room for partnership at the appropriate moment with the Learning Passport. A key take-away on this was the cost-effectiveness and ease or rapidity of deployment – besides immediate relevance – of these local, home-grown solutions. Parallel to this learning was the obvious realization of the empowerment aspect of such engagement with UNICEF among the local partnerships. It raised their profile more than hitherto, and a wider section of society got to be aware of their existence, and impact. Lessons learnt in 2020 enabled the sector to improve 2021 response and improve design and implementation.

The value of strategic positioning and partnerships came to the fore in 2021 with efforts on-going to push forward the Generation Unlimited (GenU) agenda in South Africa. A key lesson learned from the foundational work done on GenU is to ensure that a global initiative is contextualized in-country and a clear value proposition established. For example, in South Africa there is a Presidential Youth Employment Initiative (PYEI) that mirrors the goals of GenU. In 2022, UNICEF will work closely with GIZ, ILO, UNDP, the World Bank and the EU to position GenU into the local context. 

In Social Policy, the main lesson learned in 2021 was to focus on simplifying the overall work agenda for the year - primary research is time-intensive and challenging and leads to defined opportunity costs; and, finding a better balance between research and advocacy and treating the demands of advocacy in the same way you would with reference to primary research and analysis. Responding to the constraints, the programme invested heavily in evidence generation based on the assumption that the primary research is unlikely to date and could be used in advocacy work in 2022 and beyond. This research also served to strategically remind the government of the excellent work it has done and not to destroy its overall commitment to children’s programmes during this period of fiscal consolidation. Collaborative work with other programmes in UNICEF will become necessary to capitalise on programme’s extensive networks and to restore the integrity and cohesiveness of children’s programming.
"
ESAR,South Sudan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Communities in South Sudan are choosing to take self-action for development, despite having faced conflict and division as well as becoming used to subsidies and aid. Significant gains were made in sanitation in Northern Bahr el Ghazal and Eastern Equatoria through the CLTS approach, which stimulates demand for sanitation which is then met by communities through building their own toilets and collectively agreeing to open defecation.
 
Localization in supply chains is also proving to be important, for example, to enable the flow of spare parts for sustainable operations and maintenance of improved water sources. In 2022, UNICEF will explore the development of strong WASH supply chains for the local market including the use of voucher systems. UNICEF is also working with partners to provide more sustainable WASH services as part of the transition away from Protection of Civilians (POC) sites in Juba, servicing displaced populations with water supply through a voucher system via WFP’s SCOPE system that will be launched in 2022.   
 
Recurrent cycles of floods are a clear manifestation of climate change calling for innovative, resilient, and environmentally sensitive infrastructure and better contingency and preparedness planning. UNICEF established agreements with NGO partners in advance of the rainy season, to rapidly respond to flood displacement response needs. UNICEF was able to deploy more durable solutions much more rapidly for repair of water points, installation of emergency water facilities, and support to communities for emergency sanitation facilities.
 
UNICEF will continue to advocate to donors for anticipatory financing, including for adaptable mobile light responses, considering the logistical challenges in South Sudan when the rains constrain construction and movements.
 
UNICEF is actively innovating for climate change adaptation, and in emergency contexts piloted elevated latrines constructed with the participation of households as a flood adaptation measure. This includes using local materials and raised superstructures to avoid collapse and flooding during the rainy season. Similarly, UNICEF piloted elevated handpumps in food insecure counties with regular flooding incidences.  This is now being disseminated as climate adaptation good practice by the WASH Cluster.
 
Multisectoral programming continues to reap dividends in resource allocation, efficiently and effectiveness. By integrating underfunded initiatives such as WASH, GBV and Child Protection into integrated funding proposals, UNICEF provided much needed funding to these sectors. 
 
Child protection and GBV continued its integration and mainstreaming in other clusters and sector programming through for example training on GBV risk mitigation for WASH and health. The multisectoral integration of MHPSS has shown a real impact with an increased number of reached beneficiaries (92,790 children including 43,700 girls in 2021) with low-cost implications.
 
In 2021 UNICEF’s health programme strengthened its approach to integration with other sectors. This was reflected through the integration of Clinical Management of Rape into the package of essential health services;  installing social workers in health facilities to enhance GBV referral pathways; the development of a GBV pocket guide for GBV first aid by community health actors; adequate water storage and waste management infrastructures in health facilities to enhance the quality of maternal and newborn health services;  the ongoing integration of systematic HIV testing for malnourished children with complications; and the integration of nutritional screening for acute malnutrition by Boma Health Workers.
 
UNICEF nutrition and WASH collaborated to target hygiene and water treatment items to the caretakers and mothers of malnourished children. Nutrition sites where wasting treatment take place provided an excellent platform to deliver integrated nutrition, health, WASH and child protection services as evidenced by successful screening of children for malaria, distribution of 350,000 bednets, 745,000 bars of soap and 24 million tablets of Aquatab, and offers possibility for linkages with safety net programmes. 
 
The integrated nutrition and food insecurity scale up brought innovation in the merging of multiple intersectoral community networks and volunteers to improve reach, reduce the risk of disease, increase access to services and save lives. This model of local integration, as well as enhanced collaboration for preventative actions has enabled greater impact and scale of emergency programmes, increasing UNICEF’s ability to reach more children, better, with less.   
 
In 2021, the Food Security and Nutrition Monitoring System expanded for the first time to include other sectors such as education, child protection and shelter modules.
 
UNICEF South Sudan led global knowledge management efforts on scaling nutrition in complex emergencies through publication of a UNICEF field note and two peer reviewed articles to share experience and lessons learned on scaling up care for children with SAM through integrated community-based management of severe wasting programmes. UNICEF championed the family mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) initiative to improve SAM case-finding and referral. The initiative empowers mothers and caregivers of under-fives to assess the nutrition status of their children through distribution of MUAC tapes and training on identification of early signs of malnutrition using MUAC. This helped to mitigate the safety concerns associated with mass screening in the COVID-19 context. 
 
The school closures due to COVID 19 provided any opportunity explore new partnerships with media houses and mobile network operators to support distance learning through radio programmes in the country. It also revealed the gaps in interventions for children with disabilities and children in vulnerable households. This requires a sharpened approach to reach the most vulnerable, including collection of disability disaggregated data, and increased advocacy for disadvantaged children (pastoralist communities, children with disabilities, children in hard-to-reach areas, girls subject to child marriage, etc.). There is a need to capitalize on UNICEF’s supported radio programmes and make distance learning a credible pathway for learning through investments in children’s access to digital technologies. 
Finally, UNICEF is supporting MoFP to develop an innovative online PFM tracker/dashboard to enhance accountability in public finance for children. The dashboard will track progress against key milestones of the budget drafting and reporting processes at national and state levels; at state level, annual spending priority plans are to be submitted based on state strategic plans, and local governments set spending priorities based on county development plans and an annual participatory planning process. The dashboard will be rolled out 2022.
"
ESAR,Uganda,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"A key lesson learned from the COVID-19 experience is that flexible modalities and pathways integrating emergency planning with strengthening primary health care services can be used to make health systems more resilient. Notably, village  health teams, which are at the frontline of community service delivery, received government financial remuneration – a key step change in primary  health care development.

Another important learning was that national-level governance and effective coordination resulted in improved responsiveness and delivery of emergency responses at all levels, supported by multisectoral engagement and  partnerships to mitigate resource duplication and fragmented programme implementation. 

Data-driven programming for quality improvement is also important to close existing gaps among the most vulnerable sub-populations. This has led to modernizing data collection, analysis, and sharing, paired with investments in strengthening institutional capacity for timely data use.

Another major lesson learned in 2021 is that institution-based education cannot be taken for granted and continuity of learning needs to include parenting education for home-based care and learning, self-study, community-based learning, and distance learning. The COVID-19 pandemic also highlighted the need to expand affordable digital access to the most deprived children.

Digital platforms, social media, and helplines provide great opportunity for continued engagement and remote delivery of both child protection and GBV services, but the digital divide, based on age, gender, and wealth, remains a challenge. Poor families are less likely to have access to mobile devices and the digital literacy needed for effective engagement. In addition, the pandemic reinforced the fact that the most vulnerable children need greater attention and cannot remain excluded from key services. This led to successful advocacy with the government to release children in remand homes and promote alternatives to detention in line with international standards.
   
  Safely managed WASH services are fundamental to protecting human health during all infectious disease outbreaks including COVID-19. District management information systems (MIS) and SDG tracking for climate resilience have been models for leveraging domestic resource and planning. This offers huge opportunity to facilitate and enhance WASH modalities and environmental practices. An example of this is the innovative UNICEF-supported approach to extending piped water systems from schools and health facilities to the community, thereby enhancing local ownership and sustainability of water supply services. 

UNICEF leveraged digital health approaches to integrate all data registry into HMIS, which has enabled DHIS2 legacy migration through child health, WASH, and nutrition dashboards and helped to identify the exact WASH gaps experienced by children and women. Similarly, for ECD-related Key Family Care  Practices,  pregnant and lactating women and women were reached using a  digital health tool called FamilyConnect with outcomes measured using  indicators such as ANC1, ANC 4, health facility deliveries, and DPT3  coverage.

The use of the national logistics management information system and supply distribution system were key to the provision of critical supplies to  districts, fostering greater visibility, transparency, efficiencies and  sustainability of UNICEF and donor-supported interventions.

A further key lesson learned was that despite the high turnover of technical  personnel, the up-to-date maintenance of the online system and the regular data capture of off-budget financing for the health sector continued uninterrupted. This smooth continuity of the work provides evidence for the value of institutionalizing off-budget tracking and demonstrates that full sector ownership of all off-budget tracking processes is the only sustainable approach to the undertaking.

Another learning was that the inclusion of the VAC module in the National Survey on Violence demonstrated the importance of strengthening the UNICEF relationship with government partners through technical support provision. 

There is also urgent need to establish a robust social register and a functioning MIS for social protection. In June 2021, the President issued a directive on the provision of emergency cash transfers to people whose livelihoods were affected by COVID-19 lockdown measures. However, the existing single registry is not linked to, nor does it capture, all the data from the related MIS systems of other programmes and sectors. Given the limitation of time and the lack of a social register, identifying beneficiaries in the occupational categories approved by Cabinet was tasked to the local leaders – and it led to a lot of complaints. UNICEF is working with other development partners to support the government in putting a social register in place that captures information on all vulnerable people. 

UNICEF engagement with three key ministries enabled the development of a real-time monitoring system for SDG 6.1 and 6.2 data, disaggregated to the sub-national level. This has demonstrated the need for a robust monitoring system to track progress in SDG reporting. Furthermore, UNICEF contributed to position WASH in the revision of the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and climate risk assessment to address climate-related risks in WASH and leverage climate financing in coming years.

With the prioritization of the Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) agenda globally, UNICEF analyzed the gaps and entry points in Uganda, to mainstream AAP across its workstreams. As such, having mapped out the entry points both internally and externally, UNICEF worked to institutionalize AAP within its processes and systems in 2021. This included assimilating feedback from beneficiaries, setting up indicators and clauses within all its programme cooperation agreements, training staff, and developing a UNICEF Uganda Country Office action plan. This groundwork has enabled UNICEF to adapt its programmes to the needs and preferences on the ground and enhance local ownership and help build trust between UNICEF and communities.

COVID-19 related restrictions on physical interactions and travel hindered routine field monitoring and direct technical support by UNICEF zonal offices. Moreover, the need to decentralize work and ensuring programme implementation is brought closer to communities was greater than ever before. This necessitated adaptable virtual solutions that promote accountability and information sharing such as the Zonal Office Peer Review Dashboard, which is fully aligned with the Country Office decentralization strategy. The COVID-19 containment measures also encouraged the emergency education sector to adapt by providing learning opportunities through home-based self-study materials and radio, TV, and Internet lessons for refugee children.

ESAR,United Rep. of Tanzania,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Key lessons learned in gender-transformative programming were captured in a report published in 2021, highlighting 12 gender-equality promising practices in Mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar. The promising practices provide insights into the factors behind successful gender results for children and families in Tanzania, from gender-responsive programme design to strategic partnerships and gender-equitable representation in implementation and evaluation. Using appreciative inquiry and storytelling approaches, the promising practices highlight the human experience in understanding what works well in a particular community’s natural context. The in-depth stories provide an insight into the motivation, contribution and efforts of individuals at different stages of the socioecological model in order to achieve gender equality. Lessons learned through these practices can also be relevant for achieving gender equality in the region and beyond.  
  
UNICEF learned valuable lessons from its work in strengthening primary healthcare facilities in 2021. The improvement of WASH services through upgrading facilities at primary healthcare facilities in remote rural areas offering maternal and newborn services delivered immediate results by restoring care-seeking behaviour and increasing demand for delivery at these facilities as evidenced by the increased number of women delivering at the improved healthcare facilities. These findings will be documented systematically by UNICEF generating credible evidence to inform advocacy strategies targeting increased investments and resource allocation to improve healthcare facilities across Tanzania.  
  
Among the lessons learned on advocacy is the importance of mapping existing influencers for UNICEF engagement. This mapping has enabled UNICEF to identify key champions among influencers and leverage their existing platforms/institutions in support of advocacy efforts. Leveraging existing platforms is a cost-efficient approach to outreach, positioning UNICEF as a technical partner providing guidance, evidence and facts on child rights issues. Key to making a tangible impact this year was the identification of strategic ways to engage youth networks to strengthen partnerships beyond events and consultations, such as organizing outreach sessions, campaigns on different topics, and informative seminars. More effort is now required to meaningfully engage the most marginalized children, including children with disabilities, children from rural areas, refugee children, children from low-income households, and children living with HIV/AIDS.  
  
The COVID-19 pandemic continued to provide numerous opportunities to be innovative and experiment with new approaches to achieve results for children at scale. During the reporting year, three rounds of evidence from knowledge, attitudes and practices surveys on COVID-19 prevention and readiness to accept COVID-19 vaccines were implemented with UNICEF support. U-Report was used to gather data on individuals’ and communities' knowledge, attitudes, practices, myths, and beliefs about COVID-19 and the COVID-19 vaccine. This proved to be a cost-effective and rapid means of gathering quality data. The evidence was used to inform and update communication messages and in the revision of the COVID-19 Response Plan and the second phase of the Health Sector Accelerated Community-Based COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy.   
  
In partnership with the Tanzania Red Cross Society, a real-time SMS-based information sharing and counselling system on COVID-19 vaccines was implemented through  the Jambo la Chanju programme to counter vaccine myths. Since it began, the programme received more than 9,000 queries, attaining 92 per cent of its overall target, which was to reach 10,000 queries and generate 26,687 replies over a seven-week period to clarify questions about COVID-19 vaccines.   
  
Using innovative media engagement methods, UNICEF leveraged digital media influencers and increased its digital reach from around 8 million people monthly on all platforms to over 12.2 million per month in 2021. This was done through intense direct engagement with over 30 online influencers, including Sustainable Development Goal champions, young changemakers, celebrities, and over 1,000 volunteers who have vouched their support during online campaigns, resulting in boosting engagement on children’s issues. Public outreach through Elimika Wikiendi and Facebook and other social media platforms resulted in over 45,000 engagements collectively and more than 88,000 Twitter followers enabling UNICEF to become a leading voice in the promotion of vaccine confidence.  
  
UNICEF further engaged in a partnership with a global housing products company Lixil by incorporating elements of a market-based approach to the implementation of the National Sanitation Campaign in Songwe and Iringa regions. Through the partnership, UNICEF leveraged an additional US$600,000 to strengthen the enabling environment for sanitation and hygiene improvement and over 28,000 households installed an innovative product design for improving access to basic hand washing (Ndoo Chirizi). The partnership contributed to an additional 248 villages attaining ODF by enabling lower income households to afford basic sanitation and hygiene infrastructure. An important lesson learned from thisthis, and other private sector WASH partnerships was that these partnerships can make meaningful and swift improvements in access, use, and sustainability of WASH services at both community and institutional levels. UNICEF’s partnership with another private sector consortium, the CEO Roundtable of Tanzania, demonstrated the synergies that are available with corporate social responsibility initiatives and the private sector’s ability to provide solutions to development-oriented challenges.   
  
Frontline workers trained in child protection are often relocated, leaving gaps in provision of child and family support in their districts. A wider human resource capacity building approach is needed to ensure that relocation of child protection staff or other factors (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) does not impact on service provision. UNICEF, together with justice stakeholders, has begun digitalising the provision of trainings as part of a new approach to capacity building, including development of a 45-minute self-teaching video. This tool is now being used by officers responsible for managing children’s court cases all over the country. Not only is it key to orientating new officers, but it is also acting as a reference for already trained officers in the proper management of children’s court cases.

ESAR,Zambia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The recurrent waves of COVID-19 continued to have a significant impact on people’s health and well-being, but also went well beyond that – impacting the ability to design and deliver programmes, and risking hard fought development gains being compromised. The continuing protracted economic crisis further exacerbated all of this, and it is in this context that the following lessons were learned and innovations tested. 
Lesson Learned #1: The roll out of COVID-19 vaccines using the antigens from five different platforms (AstraZeneca, Johnson & Jonson, Sinopharm, Pfizer BionTech and Moderna) has been a complex operation that required multisectoral engagement across the sectors of health, supply and procurement and social and behaviour change communication; expanded partnerships; and dedicated resources and expertise with in-depth technical and operational know-how. More specifically, the roll out required concerted efforts on risk communication and community engagement to promote demand generation, manage and address mis-information, identify and use innovative approaches and strategies of vaccines delivery outside of the health sector platform (e.g. schools, markets, places of worship). It also required a simultaneous and parallel approach of sustaining the continuity of routine health services and ensuring the resilience of the health system. This was done through leveraging partnerships and resources to safeguard stocks of essential health commodities, strengthen and maintain medical oxygen ecosystems and cold chain systems. The minimal disruption of essential services by COVID-19, as evidenced by a 10 to 15 per cent coverage reduction, is the result of these collective efforts.
Lesson Learned #2: adapting programme design and delivery in the context of COVID-19 and its resulting restrictions has been a key lesson across programmes. In the context of delivering HIV services, this  triggered the need to innovate and scale differentiated service delivery models, such as multi-month dispensation of ARVs to stable patients. Multi-month dispensation of ARVs entail longer refill periods for ARVs leading to decongestion at health facilities, limited clinic visits which translate to savings on transport and time to undertake other engagements for clients. Similarly in education, various innovative and alternative methods to ensure access and quality education were explored. For example, self-study kits for lower secondary learners were developed and distributed to 11,000 learners, including children in refugee camps, children with disabilities and girls. ECE radio lessons were developed in local languages to ensure children have access to education in early years. UNICEF will continue to adopt these innovative methods to ensure continuity of learning for children and see how these practices can be used and expanded in non-COVID-19 contexts. 
Lesson Learned #3: The Scaling-Up Nutrition Programme continued to provide a platform for enhanced multisectoral programme implementation to address stunting. The Government instituted integrated platforms at district and ward level, called Nutrition Coordination Committees. These facilitated synergies between key line ministries in coordinating planning and implementation to provide integrated services. At community level, the adoption of the Nutrition Support Group approach, which uses community volunteers to increase contact between mothers and caretakers, is a game changer in realising desired change in nutrition behaviours. Through this approach, community volunteers will deliver key nutrition messages and link beneficiaries to a package of interventions ranging from improved feeding practices to good sanitation and hygiene, agriculture, livestock, fisheries and other services. Lessons on setting up, strengthening, supervising and monitoring such community groups can benefit community engagement across other sectors.
Lesson Learned #4: Despite increasing efforts in delivery of social assistance, poverty levels are estimated to be on the rise in the wake of the pandemic and concurrent economic pressures. This points to the reality that graduation pathways for the beneficiaries of the SCTs are insufficient and constraining the rate of poverty reduction despite large scale efforts. There is a need to further strengthen cash-plus and shock-responsive approaches and to build human capital for vulnerable populations, starting from early childhood."
ESAR,Zimbabwe,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF’s experience in Zimbabwe in 2021, as well as across the 2016-2021 cycle, produced numerous lessons learned that offer great potential to accelerate results, at scale, going forward. 

Flexible Emergency Response 
 
Given the fluctuating situation in Zimbabwe, with public health emergencies and frequent seasonal droughts and cyclones, there is a need for programmes to be flexible in nature and span the development-humanitarian and peace nexus, in order to scale up and down depending on the needs. According to an evaluative assessment commissioned by UNICEF, and, as highlighted in the (2019) Real Time Evaluation of the Cyclone Idai response over the country Programme cycle, UNICEF’s programme has demonstrated flexibility to enable the achievement of results as humanitarian crises have arisen, including in the COVID-19 response and the response to the 2019 Cyclone Idai. UNICEF has integrated ‘humanitarian response’ within the sectoral rolling workplans through a) creating humanitarian outputs in each sectoral programme structure, b) basing the annual results and target setting on a Country-risk analysis, and c) integrating crisis modifiers that enable repurposing of regular interventions to flexibly respond to emergencies. UNICEF’s preparedness, flexibility and swift adaptation have been critical to mitigate risks, ensure continuity of programming and achieve results. The flexibility on the part of donors and other partners was also critical in facilitating UNICEF’s reprogramming and support for continuity of activities and timely COVID-19 response efforts. Moving forward, UNICEF will build on its resource mobilization strategy to develop innovative strategies to enhance resource mobilization for emergency response. 
 
Flexibility for ‘emergency response’ has also been championed by UNICEF amongst partners. The End-Line Evaluation of the Health Development Fund (HDF) Programme in Zimbabwe (2016-2020) demonstrated that the Health Sector benefited from having preparedness measures and systems in place and agile programme approaches to be able to shift gears and scale up responses. HDF workplans were reviewed and adapted to the prevailing situation on a quarterly basis to enable real-time programme adjustment. This made swift reprogramming possible ensuring adequate pandemic response and adapted strategies to maintain continuity of essential services. The HDF support (technical and financial) for Village Health Workers also contributed to lift the motivation, retention and performance, also invaluable during emergencies.
 
Joint Programming 
 
From 2016-2021, key success stories were particularly related to long-term joint programming with other UN agencies, based on complementarity and the Government of Zimbabwe and with a focus on systems-strengthening through capacity building. The multi-donor funding mechanisms, particularly the HDF and the Education Development Fund are key examples of successful joint/multi-stakeholder programming. The HDF Evaluation has shed light on the successes achieved, with a highlighted need for continued investment by the Government in the social sectors to ensure sustainability. The Results Based Financing (RBF) mechanism has facilitated the continuity of essential services at health centers and in communities in the context of constrained resources and staff demotivation. The HDF has also supported increased, Government health sector funding in 2022. A key lesson was that the HDF programme was successful investing in the Ministry of Health and Child Care’s existing structures (instead of creating parallel structures) thus achieving efficiencies and enabling the Government (with improved capacities) to sustain the interventions. According to the evaluation, the approach is suited to all large-scale public-sector-led programmes.
 
Innovative Approaches 
 
UNICEF has developed innovative approaches over the cycle, especially in response to the challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
In terms of the use of technology, in March 2021, UNICEF, with the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education, launched the Zimbabwe Learning Passport and increased access for 79,560 users to digital learning and 3,700 local content learning materials. In partnership with the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, UNICEF is moving forward with the Green School concept through the implementation of solar power in schools and to access the Learning Passport using the offline server. The Emergency Social Cash Transfer programme has harnessed technology in delivering its programme with the use of tablets and digital data collection tools, linked to Rapid Pro to enhance engagement with programme beneficiaries remotely, frequently and cost effectively. Under the Child Protection Fund, UNICEF scaled up remote and virtual services and facilitated key adaptions, including procuring Personal Protective Equipment for frontline workers who interact with children and communities. Building on the feasibility of exploring the functionality of online courts, UNICEF, in 2021, also finalized processes of ensuring that E-courts become a reality. The architecture to establish such courts was overseen by the Victim Friendly System which has an electronic system that is child-sensitive and adheres to court procedures.
 
For innovative programme adaptation, during the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, HIV self-testing became popular, leading to an increase in its uptake, including amongst adolescents and young people (547,033 tested in 2021 with 9 per cent positivity rate). Self-testing could be the game changer in identification, especially for adolescent girls and young women, to whom most new HIV infections are occurring. To minimize COVID-19, UNICEF successfully designed and advocated for a new, durable, climate-resilient, group handwashing facility for schools to be rolled out by the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education, shifting the strategy away from mobile, temporary, plastic handwashing units which need to be regularly replaced. The new group handwashing facility design utilizes a low-flow design, to reduce water use, ensures maintenance is affordable and enables more than 10 students to wash hands at one time. Children also take the time to sing and teach each other good hygiene practices while demonstrating the proper hand washing technique. Key communication interventions that were developed for ‘COVID-19 Risk Communication and Community Engagement’ have now been embedded in sectoral platforms and partnerships, helping them to be more efficient and cost effective. Finally, the integrated outreach services that were developed in 2020 and continued into 2021 to support cross-sector messaging around health, nutrition and protection, have resulted in more children being reached, particularly from very remote parts of communities, far from health facilities, with a comprehensive package of health and nutrition services. 

"
LACR,Argentina,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Municipality United for Children and Adolescents (MUNA)
 
Poverty affects 54.9% of children in Argentina (as of the first half of 2021); however, it is not distributed evenly across the national territory. Extreme child poverty is concentrated in 17% of the country's municipalities, where nearly two million children and adolescents live. A further 10% of municipalities, with more than 500,000 inhabitants, are home to 70% of poor children and adolescents (9.3 million). The capacity of the municipalities to guarantee rights differs, and the compensatory capacity of the provinces and the national government is insufficient.
 
For this reason, UNICEF decided to focus its support on these territories through the Municipality United for Children and Adolescents (MUNA) initiative . Its purpose is to offer technical assistance and incentives to local governments to design, implement and monitor public interventions aimed at improving the quality of life of children, to improve coordination among different levels of government and to strengthen municipal management capacities. 
 
The strategy proposed by MUNA includes training, support and generation of resources for municipal teams to carry out self-diagnosis regarding the situation of children and adolescents in their territory and, subsequently, to develop, implement and monitor an action plan to respond to the main problems detected. UNICEF will design a certification system for the efforts made by each municipality, both in the initial stage (preparation of the action plan, at the end of the first year) and at the end point (verifiable progress over four years). MUNA implementation is carried out with the strategic support of the provincial governments and national government agencies and with the participation of non-governmental actors present in each municipality.
 
As of 2021, the initial MUNA design stage has been completed and the initiative has been launched in four provinces (Entre Ríos, Jujuy, Salta and Santa Fe). Mayors of 31 municipalities signed Letters of Commitment and began to designate their teams. Local networks were established to promote exchange between municipal and provincial referents. Eleven thematic lines in relation to children’ rights were defined, and the development of the related training resources began. Finally, the training cycle in public management started, with the participation of more than 100 public officials.
 
In 2022, MUNA launches are expected in other provinces, to reach 70 municipalities. Also, face-to-face meetings will be organized to consolidate the local networks and support the self-diagnosis process while continuing the training in public management. Lastly, further training resources will be developed, a virtual campus created and a ‘learning community’ promoted among municipalities.
 
The main challenges encountered so far were: 
1. the limitations to regular face-to-face contact with the participating municipalities, imposed by the epidemiological situation. A hybrid strategy was chosen to deal with this scenario. At the same time, progress was made in the agreement of work plans with the provincial governments to count, in the future, with professionals who carry out monitoring and support tasks to the municipalities within their province; 
2. the coordination of many actors (both internal and external) involved in the generation of thematic proposals. To overcome this challenge, clear general guidelines were defined, and a permanent communication with the different teams established; 
3. reaching political agreements to promote coordination between the provincial and municipal governments. In this case, it was decided to involve provincial authorities (including Governors) in the launch of the initiative and to institutionalize the role of provinces within the general MUNA scheme.
 
Alternative models of access to connectivity and appropriation of technologies in vulnerable educational communities.
 
The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the continuity of children and adolescent learning has revealed the marked heterogeneity and inequality in the country's availability of computer equipment and access to connectivity. In Argentina, a group of 5,600 schools has been identified in contexts and geographic locations where current connectivity solutions cannot reach.
In this framework, the multisectoral alliance Generación Única, led by UNICEF Argentina and accompanied by CAF and ILO, contributed to the expansion of internet access in educational communities with difficult access through the development of alternative models of connectivity and pedagogical appropriation of technologies. Furthermore, the alliance generated evidence to scale these or other connectivity solutions for all 5,600 educational institutions.
This innovation consists of:
 
-         The design and implementation of experimental models of alternative connectivity in rural and urban schools with difficult access.
-         The generation of evidence on its implementation for the modelling of experimental initiatives and the generation of proposals for universal internet access.
 
As part of the results achieved, the mapping study of alternative models of connectivity for schools with difficult access and their applications at an international level has been published. Two tools have been developed to characterize educational communities: (1) a GIS that allows the mapping and territorial description of schools and connectivity, and (2) a Business Intelligence (BI) application that allows the characterization of connectivity models focusing on predictivity.
 
In terms of experimental models, the installation, start-up and provision of connectivity and technological floor have been carried out in seven schools, with Radio Link and HTS Link technologies, reaching 687 students. The first stage of pedagogical support for the use and appropriation of these technologies has been developed, reaching 120 provincial teachers and technical teams. The next steps are to complete the second stage of techno-pedagogical support in the schools of the provinces involved. 
 
Regarding evidence generation, in 2022 the review and modelling of the experimental initiatives will be implemented, in collaboration with ILO. Furthermore, the development of a Business Model for the scalability of alternative connectivity initiatives is foreseen in conjunction with International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and the global initiative Giga. Finally, a strategy for technical assistance to the national and provincial governments will be developed to define connectivity plans at scale for all schools with difficult access.
Lessons learned from this initiative might be useful for other country offices working on improving access to education through connectivity. 
"
LACR,Barbados,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In 2021, there was success transition in programme and office operations in the easing from face-to-face interactions to remote online working modality, and then subsequently to a hybrid approach when conditions were conducive. Extensive testing of UNICEF’s Business Continuity Plan and emphasis on a paperless environment saw the office smoothly adapt work approaches to programme delivery in a remote setting. Even with continued rises in COVID-19 cases across countries and territories, there was no disruption in programme delivery across the subregion. All staff were able to transition seamlessly from a physical to a remote work environment. While remote working addressed the continuity of programmes, the importance of ensuring a balance between focused time to participate in online meetings and guaranteeing staff were not overwhelmed and were afforded the time needed to attend personal matters and self-care was critical.
In 2021, UNICEF’s consistent and strategic engagement in evidence generation actively supported the national priorities for children and their families and programme implementation and advocacy within the ECA. The approach included leveraging and expanding partnerships to generate robust child-related data, data mining, and analysis related to key population groups and strengthening capacities to undertake real-time monitoring. This strategy has been enhanced by leveraging existing data sources for secondary analysis, including administrative data and household survey data to inform programming priorities. It has also been important to consistently monitor programme implementation with key partners to increase efficiencies and identify innovative solutions to challenges.
Three evaluations were completed in 2021: The implementation of Child Friendly Schools/Effective Schools Framework in the Eastern Caribbean; Approaches to cash-based programming in humanitarian settings: Dominica; and the UNICEF ECA MCP 2017–2021. Recommendations have shaped the formulation of the new MCP 2022–2026 and future sector-specific interventions. Specifically the overarching recommendation for all three evaluations relates to greater implementation of multi-sectoral programming with a focus on focus on advocacy, coordination, consistent monitoring of implementation and enhanced preparedness of national systems for systemic change and the humanitarian-development nexus into UNICEF ECA operational modalities.
The COVID-19 pandemic exposed ECA countries to the fact that a blended approach to education is a new reality, and that capacities are far from adequate for its delivery. In this context where technological advances are to be planned for by the education providers, it will also be necessary to support and strengthen teachers’ capacity to deliver quality instruction through virtual and face-to-face modalities. A key lesson learned was that it was necessary to be responsive to the needs of the ECD community in the changing contexts. To ensure that learning and development continues, professional development needs to continue for parents, ECD practitioners and other caregivers to support their child-rearing practices. In support of this, there was a strong pivot to the use of traditional and newer technologies with governments and national partners to provide informational and educational content for families and other caregivers, including activities for engaging young children in appropriate ways in homes and communities.
UNICEF will conduct research to investigate the impact of the pandemic on students focusing on delivery, access, quality, and attainment across all educational sectors, in order to better inform the planning of programmes.
The stigma attached to accessing mental health services in small country contexts requires more community-based strategies targeting gatekeepers and community leaders. It needs to build the resilience of community stakeholders to strengthen family and community support to promote pro-social connections and behaviours. It also needs supportive social connections and opportunities for learning, growth, and coping with new challenges. A robust child protection system requires a qualified and resourced social workforce. However, the child protection sector remains under-resourced, lacking the financial, and sometimes political, support to protect children and their families. This has been exacerbated by budget cuts and competing priorities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Continued support is needed to ensure that well-equipped social service workers support implementation of the laws, policies and programmes that governments establish to protect children.
In an environment in which COVID-19 continues to negatively impact countries and territories, support is required for social protection systems-strengthening, disaster preparedness. Both technical and financial support is needed to mitigate the socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic, and to respond to other disasters in a way that contributes to strengthening long-term systems. While UNICEF has provided support in previous years at a higher level (policy, overall capacity-building), the ‘heavier’ investments at a technical level in a subset of countries such as Antigua and Barbuda in social protection (targeting, digitization of their data management systems, grievance, communication) were welcome, and able to effectively contribute to implementing the new rights-based approach to social protection taken by these countries. UNICEF ECA will pursue this bottom-up approach through its new MCP and document the experiences to facilitate learning sharing, notably through the subregional institutions (OECS and CDEMA).
UNICEF implemented its activities supporting youth engagement in climate action through active involvement and partnership development. However, partners have limited financial resources, and many youth-led initiatives remain informal or ad-hoc. In the longer term, dedicated funds will be required to build partners’ capacities and support more structured youth networks. The upholding and expanding of traditional media channels to communicate and advocate continued to drive results for children even in the face of a rapidly expanding social media presence. Alliances with telecommunication and media companies must continue to be pursued to make sure that UNICEF’s messages penetrate all markets, especially vulnerable sections of the populations who do not have consistent access to digital media.
In the context of the migrant response, maintaining national partnerships, buy-in, and ownership is critical to enhancing protection measures among political sensitivities. Collaboration across sectors articulated and enhanced UNICEF’s delivery of services with higher standards for children on the move aligned with the Core Commitments for Children. The exchange of experiences on responses in the education sector with Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela highlighted existing system-wide gaps. At the same time, this contributed to building the capacity of the sector’s stakeholders convened in the Education Working Group.
"
LACR,Belize,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Strengthening its digital transformation agenda:  
Adapting the Programme within an evolving COVID-19 pandemic context, the office strengthened its digital transformation agenda with Apps, tools and platforms developed and scaled up for virtual engagement with partners at national, subnational and community levels. The Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) under the extended L3 emergency were instrumental in fostering adaptive processes in responding to emerging needs, especially around mental health, gender-based violence, teacher training and migration.  These initiatives ensured that children, adolescents, parents, teachers, social workers and civil society organisations amongst others were reached and engaged via SMS, social media, phone, webinars and U-Report.   
 
Supporting Duty of Care and staff wellbeing: 
Critical to the overall functionality of the office was the continued support to staff wellbeing, anchored on the organizational culture and values of Care, Respect, Integrity, Transparency and Accountability. The national adaptation of team core values and reinforcement of the Office mantra of assuming good intent became a corporate best practice with the Belize Country Office being amongst the top 20 country Offices globally during the mid-year pulse survey. Staff check in shifted from an institutional guidance to a built-in culture. Regular online fun sessions, special wellness days, practice of happiness calendar and whole change management sessions were core to building a strong and committed team. This was pivotal in the results achieved for children and for the first time developing PSNs, CPD and CPMP in house for the new country programme 2022 -2026. 

Establishment of Long-Term Agreements: 
As part of the Annual Management Plan prioritization of efficiency this year, the country office shifted from a needs-based procurement system to a more strategic approach through the establishment of long-term agreements (LTAs). These included media production companies to provide video, photography, graphic design, broadcasting and streaming, editorial and social media services; procurement of emergency and programme supplies; and vehicle rental services. The companies applied through a competitive bidding process and were vetted by a joint team    from UNICEF, United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO)/WHO (World Health Organisation), and the United Nations Resident Coordinator Office (UNRCO). To date the LTAs have been a key contribution to the Business Operating Strategy (BOS) of the UN system in Belize with significant improvement in the procurement process, supporting the efficient delivery of products and services. 
  
Governance and systems: 
In 2021 office governance mechanisms were comprehensively reviewed and updated to strengthen programme delivery and operational support. Based on the country office size and typology, the membership of the statutory committees and focal points delegation were updated with an all-inclusive approach with considerations for existing and new staff, gender, and Young UNICEF. In addition to the quarterly Country Management Team (CMT) meetings and monthly Programme Management Team (PMT) meetings, bi-monthly management meetings were held to address and mitigate significant risks to the achievement of the established results within the COVID-19 context. Standard operating processes were revised to increase effectiveness and efficiency, especially in integrated monthly travel plans, cash forecasting tool, and consolidated supply plan.  Proactive actions to improve staff well-being and security were informed by reviews of and revisions to key guidance and protocols, including COVID-19 measures within the office and in the field.  In addition, the office developed a comprehensive information and communications technology (ICT) strategy and workplan to strengthen support, capacity, and the infrastructure available to the country office.   
  
Technology for Development (T4D): 
In the realm of technology for development (T4D), the Belize Country Office worked closely with partners developing capacities and implementing key tools for improved feedback from, and in support of, young people. Key initiatives included the development of the Nex’Us platform, a web-based system for coordinating, promoting, and engaging young people on issues that impact on their rights and wellbeing. Support for U-Report is ongoing, with infrastructure being laid to improve the platform’s SMS interface. Core telecommunications companies have signed a memorandum of understanding with UNICEF, supporting with free communications on the platform. UNICEF also provided digital support to the Ministry of Health and Wellness, focusing on vaccination delivery and reporting systems. 

Learning and Development, inclusive of knowledge sharing sessions as best practice: 
In fostering a continuous learning environment, the office has dedicated knowledge sharing sessions on Fridays, covering ICT updates and tools, review of key HR policies, and the CPD process.  This was appreciated by staff members and endorsed as a best practice for continued learning and development.   In addition, stemming from the results of the pulse survey, the Learning & Training Committee (LTC), in coordination with the Local Staff Association (LSA) hosted three Change Management sessions with a consulting firm, enabling the staff members to highlight corporate culture strengths and areas for improvement.  The DISC profile analysis was introduced and identified as a tool to understand the different personalities and work styles.  The office benefited from these sessions in building the team-spirit among staff members.  Elaboration of key learning concepts and latest findings of the pulse survey results from December 2021 will be further incorporated into the development of staff members at the staff retreat scheduled for January 2022.


"
LACR,Bolivia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF Bolivia continued to adapt and work differently this year, given the continuing pandemic, a newly elected administration and ongoing political tensions. These challenges led to unique innovations and lessons learned, especially linked to making programmes more risk-informed while strengthening humanitarian-development nexus programming. 
 
To improve adolescent health, UNICEF worked with indigenous social organizations and used social communication instruments – such as community theatre – to deliver messages in creative ways. Accordingly, UNICEF effectively shared information on sensitive topics including prevention of adolescent pregnancy and intrafamily violence. This community outreach innovation resulted in strong participation among community members. The productions were both in-person and widely broadcast on the radio, TV channels and social media, expanding their reach during the pandemic.
 
In education, more than 22,000 teachers (16% of the workforce) increased their digital skills, benefiting more than 70,000 children and adolescents. 3,218 girls and adolescents in vulnerable situations benefited from programmes to increase their knowledge of digital skills and reduce the digital gender gap. This capacity-building made the education system more adaptable to diverse students’ needs and resilient to shocks such as school closures. Furthermore, UNICEF encouraged the MoE and the Government Electronics, Technology, Information and Communication Agency (AGETIC) to lead a movement towards including girls in technology. This ensured greater commitment and triggered an ambitious policy to reduce the technology gender gap. The alliance with AGETIC also helped UNICEF to create partnerships with other public entities and the private sector to promote girls’ involvement in technology.
 
In child protection, the UNICEF-designed ‘Safe Family’ helpline, originally created to address protection issues during the pandemic in 2020, was scaled up and is now a model of strong humanitarian-development nexus programming because it has become a key element of the Bolivian protection system. It will continue to expand in years to come.
 
For WASH, new partnerships with the education sector helped promote and improve hygiene practices in the pandemic context and strengthened emergency contingency planning and development programming. The combination of education for entertainment (‘edutainment’) and a multimedia communication approach using radio, TV and social media in target municipalities improved WASH behaviour change programming, generated demand, improved menstrual hygiene management and helped address environmental protection, even when face-to-face meetings were difficult in 2021. UNICEF will strengthen the WASH–education collaboration and scale up this multimedia approach with municipalities in 2022.
 
Regarding fundraising, one reason UNICEF Bolivia surpassed resource mobilization targets in 2021 was because it diversified individual donor recruitment channels. This helped to reach 5,800 individual pledge donors, exceeding the 5,000-annual target. Building a partnership with Red UNO, the country’s largest TV network, also contributed to individual giving results by building UNICEF brand recognition. 
 
UNICEF was limited in meeting with implementing partners face-to-face or in the field in 2021 due to the pandemic. Instead, the office used distance learning modalities and virtual communication to enable these partnerships to continue to deliver results. UNICEF also adopted virtual processes, such as signing agreements and conducting virtual field visits. In 2021, the country experienced a high turnover of administration counterparts both at national and subnational level – this included the turnover of front-line workers. In response, UNICEF trained new front-line workers, sensitized new leaders and advocated with new counterparts in ministries. UNICEF Bolivia’s user-friendly online training system, developed in 2020 and enhanced in 2021, allowed rapid and effective capacity-building delivery. Such systems and mechanisms will continue as an option when appropriate once mobility constraints are lifted, as they are cost-efficient and eco-friendly.
 
For a broader impact on subnational planning processes, UNICEF partnered with the Bolivian Federation of Municipal Associations to generate child-focused capacity-building processes for local planning in the country’s nine departments. Strategies included a virtual campus to promote continuing education for municipal authorities, technical staff and professionals, with a focus on child and adolescent rights and ‘leaving no one behind’. This is an enabler of results for children that will be strengthened in 2022 while subnational authorities design their own development plans.
 
After UNICEF conducted an annual review of its programming in 2021, the team confirmed that despite changes in the programming context the Country Programme, results and strategies agreed upon with national authorities were still relevant. Thus, the office will continue to strive toward the original planned results while also responding to the pandemic.
 
Regarding emergencies, UNICEF provided humanitarian assistance to address COVID-19, Venezuelan migration and wildfires. Internally, UNICEF sectoral teams received training to improve emergency planning, execution and monitoring. This also improved coordination with interagency teams and government counterparts. A second version of the Humanitarian Performance Monitoring exercise was carried out, which included not only activities related to the migrant/refugee and humanitarian response but also to development programming. This humanitarian development nexus monitoring approach will allow UNICEF to gain valuable insights into how to adjust, improve and/or design humanitarian, development and nexus programming.
 
UNICEF Bolivia’s communication strategy helped improve the scope and impact of programmatic and humanitarian activities, showing strong growth and institutional positioning. Consequently, the Plurinational Assembly and private sector publicly acknowledged UNICEF’s work results. 
 
Traditional media helped UNICEF achieve institutional visibility in 2021, but social media showed more impactful results, especially among adolescents and young people. UNICEF had more than 220,000 followers on its Facebook page and almost half a million visits to its webpage in 2021. TikTok influencers’ videos to promote the COVID-19 vaccine had millions of views. UNICEF reached 221,060 children through Business for Results (B4R) private sector partnership initiatives such as ‘Connected Te@chers’, the ‘Time to Act’ Telethon, the ‘Global Compact Roundtable for Children’ and the ‘Vaccines Bring You Closer’ campaign. UNICEF will continue this approach in 2022 while enhancing innovative strategies to fight misinformation in social media, especially messaging that prevents people from receiving COVID-19 vaccinations. 
 
Finally, UNICEF Bolivia is committed to become a more eco-efficient office by seeking ‘green certification’. UNICEF made efforts to pursue this goal and will continue to do so in 2022. Once achieved, the office will encourage other United Nations agencies and public and private sector entities to join the effort.

LACR,Brazil,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Brazil was heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The crisis escalated, with the health systems in key states collapsing at the beginning of the year. Mass COVID-19 immunization was delayed due to political divergence between the federal government and state governors, and delays in securing vaccines, all exacerbated by a wave of fake news. Despite the lack of federal government-led lockdowns and social isolation, most public schools remained closed for the first half of the year due to strong political pressure from education stakeholders. UNICEF stepped up, leveraging its convening role with the network of municipal education managers, state and municipal authorities and other actors, the congress, and the United Nations Country Team to advocate safe school reopening.

UNICEF’s vocal positioning and technical support made a crucial difference, including in large cities like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, where municipal governments reopened schools and referred to UNICEF guidance. This attests to the importance of UNICEF taking on difficult advocacy positions to advance the best interests of children, even against a lack of public support. The UNICEF survey was key to shedding light on the devastating impact of the prolonged closure of public schools on children and adolescents – on their education, mental health, and protection – and on the overall development of the country. While most schools reopened, the fragile context will require continual advocacy to guarantee educational continuity.
The escalation of the crisis in the first half of the year also required rapid adaptation to deliver timely and effective responses where they were most needed. Digital interpersonal communication channels continued to be fundamental in maintaining community engagement, two-way communication, and feedback tools. At the same time, UNICEF expanded its risk communication and community engagement beyond digital outreach and the distribution of printed materials. The identification of key local actors such as neighbourhood organizations, community and religious leaders, and youth groups, and their involvement, were fundamental for achieving large-scale mobilization results, including in social media.

As part of its response, UNICEF rolled out the framework for accountability to affected populations, and developed feedback mechanisms and tools, allowing local teams to better understand and respond to the needs and aspirations of low-income, minority and indigenous communities. The strategy on community mobilization with adolescent participation has consolidated itself as an innovative and cost-effective tool that has made it possible to do surveys efficiently through local youth, collecting insights and feedback for programming, advocacy, and interagency coordination.

Programme effectiveness was enhanced via three important exercises: a UNICEF country programme evaluation, a partnership review, and a gender and race programmatic review. The recommendations from each exercise will be used to inform the next country programme. In addition, UNICEF elaborated a comprehensive narrative report on the situation of children, including a summary SDG data gap analysis that will provide the basic data set for the development of the Country Programme Document rationale, including the prioritization exercise of vulnerable groups.

UNICEF’s field presence via its nine field offices has been critical to ensure locally adapted strategies serving the most vulnerable populations. The development of partnerships with community-based organizations has been key not only to reaching the most vulnerable communities, but also to strengthening partnerships with indigenous civil society networks, minority communities and low-income groups in urban centres.

The adoption of extended duty-of-care measures has been fundamental to protect staff and preserve their mental health. The visit of the representative to seven field offices and of human resources colleagues to Manaus when the state’s health system was collapsing brought additional proximity with the staff. It enabled the office to further adjust well-being actions and internal measures to respond to each specific situation. Visits by operations colleagues will be further intensified in 2022.

The office continued to adopt flexible work modalities while promoting collaboration. Based on epidemiological data, periods of exclusive teleworking alternated with periods of using hybrid work modalities that have been key to strengthening interactions. The different teams also took advantage of lower levels of COVID-19 cases after August to travel to the field, meet authorities and partners, organize safe events, and strengthen interpersonal relations. Work and contract modalities will be further adapted as part of preparing the new country programme in line with the new options developed by the organization.

UNICEF Brazil has continued to hone its humanitarian response capacity in the context of both COVID-19 and the Venezuelan migration response. A stronger approach to risk-informed programming and preparedness planning is emerging and informing the development of UNICEF strategy around climate change and child rights in Brazil.

The new edition of the Municipal Seal of Approval was designed considering lessons learned and the post-pandemic scenario, leading to a reduced set of priority results for municipalities to achieve by 2024. Seven integrated results were developed, and the hotspot approach used in the COVID-19 response was adapted to identify the most vulnerable municipalities, ensuring increased outreach and investments for these communities. Furthermore, an outcome on WASH was introduced to ensure that measures for WASH and infection prevention and control were integrated as a key feature, particularly to improve hygiene behaviours in schools and at the community level. Finally, an online learning strategy is being developed to support cost-effective hybrid technical assistance modalities.

The Business Advisory Board continued to be an effective forum to involve chief executives in advocacy priorities and events, to engage them on key initiatives such as 1 Million Opportunities and to mobilize funds through their networks. Meetings were intensified to get their valuable advice on campaigns and fundraising initiatives that mobilize private companies, and on advocacy about school connectivity and opportunities for young people.

UNICEF’s strong partnerships with national and subnational governments were instrumental to advance public finance for children and strengthen shock-responsive social protection systems, including via humanitarian cash transfers and by supporting government-led evaluations. The experience has shown that high-level political engagement and commitment remains key to gain scale and sustainability in social assistance and in equity-based policies, working alongside decentralized approaches to strengthen community engagement.
"
LACR,Chile,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Important lessons were learned regarding the advocacy work undertaken by UNICEF. First, it is always crucial to analyze and understand the political situation of the country in order to define the relationship with different partners. As 2021 was the last year of the current government, UNICEF had to adapt its work plan by promoting other alliances. To maintain continuity, UNICEF strengthened partnerships with civil society such as the Alliance to Eradicate Poverty, complementing the role of each of the members to advocate in different environments to raise public awareness on the urgent need to implement a child-sensitive SPF. Other important alliances that were enhanced during 2021 were those with key partners in the education area such as Recreating learning and We need to talk about education. UNICEF supported both initiatives by providing technical and financial support to amplify the voice in favour of the school reopening process, sharing good practices and highlighting the relevance for children´s development.

Another lesson learned was the importance of maintaining a closer relationship with the National Congress as a key partner for promoting changes that improve children´s lives. Taking advantage of the solid relationship constructed over the years with different members of congress and their advisers, UNICEF was able to directly influence the definition of a budget item in the Budget Law for 2022, requiring the measurement and monitoring of public investment in children. This close relationship with Congress also facilitated the relationship with the Constitutional Convention as many of the officials and advisers who support the Convention are also linked to the legislative work.

An important lesson learned has been to forge a closer relationship with the justice system beyond previous work on juvenile justice. UNICEF’s role in ensuring compliance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child standards requires convening efforts with the range of actors that play a decisive role in the protection of children – of which justice operators are very relevant. All violation cases or threats of rights violations go through judicial channels and, more specifically, family courts. Therefore, the removal of children from massive institutional care will depend on how a judge determines their best interests in a protection case; this includes migrant children needing their migratory status regularized or to be reunited with their families. 
 
UNICEF continued to deepen its work with universities and study centres to generate evidence such as the 2021 rights reparation road map to develop guidelines for determining the best interests of the child and to conduct innovative research on violence against children. It has been very important that UNICEF produces evidence and guidelines to orient the work of justice operators to evaluate and determine the best interests of children, especially those in vulnerable conditions. Since the country still does not follow a system to ensure administrative protection in cases of threats or violations to the rights of children, judicial protection is fundamental. It is not enough to ensure access to justice if the system is not able to uphold international human rights standards. Strengthening UNICEF’s work with the justice system has therefore been very important, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Judges are the only ones able to visit and monitor the situation of children under the care of the state and to ensure that protection services give adequate attention to families and children in the context of service transition. It has also been very important to have justice operators prepared to determine family reunification in a timely manner and regularize migratory status, given the current migration crisis at the northern border.

The COVID-19 vaccination campaign initiated by the government in February 2021 was an opportunity for UNICEF to make children and adolescents visible and to take advantage of the experience that UNICEF has with vaccines worldwide. The campaign Me Vacuno por Ti, carried out by UNICEF, focused on situations in the daily lives of children affected by the pandemic, such as the suspension of face-to-face classes and isolation from their family and friends. Public service announcements were launched on TNT Sports during the match between Universidad de Chile versus Colo-Colo (the two most popular soccer teams in the country) and broadcast on the social networks of UNICEF, TV Educa and Constitutional Convention TV, for example, at the airport and billboards on public roads. UNICEF supported the campaign with interviews with specialists on the effectiveness and safety of vaccines through photos of vaccinated people, animated stories, the history and importance of vaccines, a vaccination calendar against COVID-19 and the national vaccination schedule. UNICEF made an alliance with DNA radio to promote vaccination among its male audience, who were in the group of slow uptakes, through interviews with the immunologist Miguel O'Ryan (a member of the vaccines committee). UNICEF also gave children a voice through several interviews. 

One of the most important lessons learned in 2021 was the importance of ensuring the well-being of staff in order to maintain the working continuity of the Country Office. Human Resources promoted initiatives to address staff wellbeing. Among the tools most circulated and used by staff were i) Flexible working arrangements; ii) Wellbeing tips for UN personnel. and iii) Staff counselling. 
Although the office premises remained closed for much of the year, staff continued to demonstrate their efficiency and effectiveness in working under such special circumstances.
The results of the first pulse survey were presented and actions taken allowed the results of the second pulse survey to be significantly higher.

Despite facing alot of restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the first part of the year, private sector fundraising closed the year with an extraordinary performance achieving a total income of CPL 11,388 billion (US$14,6 million – exchange rate of 20 December 2021), representing a 45% increase over the last year in local currency. An important lesson learned was to strengthen and develop the team´s skills in a variety of themes that were needed and improving coordination and teamwork within UNICEF Operations, Communication and Programme Sections is also necessary for achieving goodresults. 
"
LACR,Colombia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Innovation: Technical assistance for results-based payments on ECD.
 
A key milestone this year consisted of an effective use of a UNICEF Colombia key research product for decision-making at the national level, which will potentially impact the efficient access to ECD services for 1.7 million children under 5 years of age throughout the country. In 2020, UNICEF Colombia partnered with a consultancy firm, ICBF, and the Social Prosperity Department (DPS) to analyse the feasibility of implementing a results-based payments system. 
Initially there were four Government-led programmes with a specific child focus identified as priorities for the feasibility analysis (namely the ICBF’s Early Childhood Development Programme, ICBF’s reintegration programme for adolescents who had been in contact with the law, DPS’s social assistance programme for families living in poverty, and a conditional cash transfer to overcome poverty). A joint analysis between the Government and UNICEF Colombia demonstrated that ECD showed the best potential for implementing this initiative. The selection was based on a set of key factors, including: the response capacity of service providers; available data on ECD outcomes; the enabling environment around the programme; and its own fundraising appeal with the private sector for potential public–private partnerships. The selection process also took into consideration a risk assessment. With this top-line priority selected, UNICEF Colombia and ICBF joined technical and financial resources through a partnership agreement to implement the results-based payments on the US$1.5 billion ECD service programme, administered in over 600 locations through 350 service providers. As key deliverables for 2022, this agreement, now underway, includes building the evidence base for a business case, including the mechanism’s potential for accelerating SDG4 achievement, increasing public spending effectiveness, developing institutional capacities for the results-based payments – based on evidence – and improving transparency and quality of service providers. 
 
Lesson Learned: Responding to a sudden triple emergency
 
In late March 2021, over 5,000 Venezuelan and Colombian nationals living in the state of Apure suddenly crossed into Colombia’s Arauquita municipality (Arauca department) within the course of two weeks. The two countries are separated by the Cutufi river. Entire families reported fleeing from a sudden armed confrontation along the border areas, where shootings and bombings had been witnessed. The sudden influx included about 1,800 children and adolescents at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic was raging through Colombia. As emergency shelters were quickly set up, the adequacy of WASH and child protection services became a major concern for national and local authorities as well as the humanitarian actors with a traditionally scattered presence in the area with work on the more steady and limited migration streams. 
In this very challenging situation, UNICEF Colombia set up a rapid response combining WASH, child protection and C4D interventions, in coordination with humanitarian partners as well as local and national authorities including the Border Management Presidential Office and ICBF. The triple affectation, including the sudden emergency intertwined with the complexities of setting up a response in the COVID-19 context, where UNICEF Colombia focused on addressing all the emergency layers, namely migration, impact of armed conflict and COVID-19 in a mostly rural municipality of about 56,000 people, with 76 per cent of the territory being vulnerable to flooding, where all these issues co-existed with lagging child-related indicators (69 per cent net coverage for education, 13 per 1,000 births of women between 14 and 17 , 4.7 repetition rate and about 22,000 people displaced by conflict between 1984 and 2017) and high levels of poverty (49 per cent). 
In this context, UNICEF Colombia initially prioritized life-saving interventions on WASH, setting up 48 sinks, 11 showers, 23 toilets and 9 bathrooms in some of the areas used as temporary shelters to ensure dignified conditions as well as hygiene standards, which were also critical to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in relatively small (although mostly open-air) spaces. UNICEF Colombia also supported the ICBF’s surge capacity by providing technical assistance for the set-up of 10 mobile child protection teams that strengthened and activated child protection routes and protocols, while also supporting the prevention of child recruitment and using creative and pedagogical methodologies as part of the psychosocial support needed by the community. Understanding the specific risks of unaccompanied and separated children and adolescents, UNICEF Colombia also advocated for the expansion of slots for the official foster home modality, using a family-based approach. With the specific concerns related to potential PSEA risks, UNICEF Colombia also disseminated key PSEA guidance among humanitarian workers, service providers, implementing partners and staff responsible for shelters.
As the situation settled, additional actions also took a more development-oriented shape based on the needs seen as the initial response took place, taking into host communities concerns and the strain created by this sudden emergency. As such, additional WASH rehabilitation and storage initiatives took place, reaching a total of 20,000 people. Maintenance of this increased capacity has been taken up by local authorities. These actions were further complemented with C4D materials delivered for the dissemination of key messages on child protection and promotion of key hygiene practices during COVID-19, support for the Mayor's Office’s radio spots, and through recreational and cultural activities. Arauquita is also part of UNICEF Colombia’s prioritized municipalities on its signature ‘Child Friendly Territories’ initiative, which is supporting the sustainability of these actions with a forward-looking perspective on accountability and prioritization on investment in children at the local level. 
On balance, the response and development initiatives rapidly designed and put in place in Arauquita show the importance of adapting existing interventions used in conflict situations (displacement) for other emergencies in consultation with communities. In addition, this demonstrates UNICEF response capacity, guaranteed through a strong field presence and a functional network of local implementing partners, with a strong humanitarian and development approach in line with AAP and PSEA standards. Actions were implemented in a record time in close coordination with relevant authorities and host communities to ensure relevance and sustainability. This successful good practice was also adapted and replicated for the response developed for migrants heading into Panama.
"
LACR,Costa Rica,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Digitalization and the safe use of new technologies were paramount for UNICEF in 2021, supporting partners on delivery of programmes and services for children and adolescents through digital platforms, ensuring more robust continuity of services and digital inclusion. While it was an urgency for the Education sector, the office realized that digitalization of social services was essential to keep them functioning during COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. 

The National Child Care and Development Network, comprising more than 1,200 ECD centres, now has a digital Information Management System that compiles data from 78% of the country’s ECD centres, including 9% of children from 0 to 12 years old in poverty or extreme poverty.

The Learning Passport or Aprendo Pura Vida platform will be available for all 1.2 million students in early 2022 as well as the platform Orienta2, enabling students to develop their vocational plans and connect them with vocational trainings and professional opportunities. The availability of internet connectivity of 4,381 schools (of which 4,097 are connected to the internet) was mapped out and uploaded to the global GIGA platform to monitor and promote good internet connection for all schools. In addition, 97 computers were distributed to students from vulnerable communities. The MEP also started using digital anthropometric data, registering 20,495 undocumented migrant children and adolescents in 2021 (out of 66,115 migrant students enrolled in the public education system).

More than 2,440 migrant students were officially documented though a partnership with MEP, PANI, the National Foreign and Migration Directorate and UNICEF. Approximately 5,700 are on a waiting list to be documented in 2022. Moreover, 15 Safe Spaces were opened in migrant host communities from 11 municipalities, offering education recovery support, psychosocial and referral services and recreational activities to over 2,000 children and adolescents.

In partnership with the Parque La Libertad Foundation, 39 adolescents with disabilities and 15 indigenous adolescents were trained in digital alphabetization to access public education and other digital learning opportunities. And, for the first time, 116 children and adolescents were consulted to inform the development of the National Policy for Telecommunications 2021–2027 under the leadership of the Ministry of Science, Innovation, Technology and Telecommunications, which became a partner of UNICEF in the reporting year, supporting the country’s efforts to promote safe internet access for all children and adolescents. The President of the Republic signed the Law 10020 for the Prevention of Children and Adolescent Digital Bullying and Grooming and Penal Code Reform.

A set of youth camps related to gender violence and digital security for young women between 12 and 22 years old was undertaken, benefiting 200 girls. The nationwide Youth Group of Generación Bicentenario, supported by Vice Presidency and UNICEF, launched a campaign to raise awareness of Digital Divide, and the importance of universal access to high-speed connectivity for all children, adolescents and young people. A training of trainers for 60 young people on topics related to digital inclusion, entrepreneurship, employability will be undertaken in 2022.

With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, the exacerbation of the migrant crisis in the region with many children and adolescents on the move, and the increased number of natural disasters highly affecting Central America, UNICEF Costa Rica was challenged to embrace both the regular development programme as well as various emergency responses. Programme flexibility and adaptability continued to be a cornerstone in the reporting year, ensuring that UNICEF fulfils its obligations to children and adolescents. The initial theory of change and programme strategies were adjusted to respond to the new challenges and new intervention models were developed and tested.

The Wellbeing Index for Children and Adolescents (IBINA 2020), launched in the reporting year, is considered an innovation as it provides disaggregated, local and low-cost information based on administrative data.  

UNICEF Costa Rica expanded its procurement and supplies function with purchase of US$1 million in programme supplies, an increase of 36% from 2020, supporting children, women and families highly affected by hurricanes and the COVID-19 pandemic. To address the need to be more efficient and faster with procurement of supplies and services to better respond to the emerging challenges, UNICEF Costa Rica carried out a market survey in 2021, identifying and screening 440 services providers to accelerate the contracting process and the delivery of supplies for children and adolescents. Other UN agencies and the RCO are already using the database created by UNICEF. 

As part of the vision of ensuring financial sustainability of UNICEF Costa Rica, private fundraising partnerships (PFP) operations were transferred from the regional office to Costa Rica Country Office in 2021, leading to the establishment of a PFP unit that oversees the individual giving fundraising strategy implemented through multiple channels such as telemarking, digital platforms and face-to-face. The unit is also responsible for corporate engagement partnerships which will be another fundraising focus in 2022.

In future, UNICEF Costa Rica should advocate for and strengthen (1) the expansion of quality and inclusive education from early childhood to secondary education, with universal access to the internet and new technologies; (2) the expansion of social protection policies to eradicate child poverty and protect the most vulnerable, directly benefiting the 34 out of 100 girls and boys living under the poverty line; (3) opportunities for adolescents and young people to complete their formal education and develop skills and competencies for employability; (4) actions to mitigate the impact of climate change on children and adolescents to whom the impacts of the environment currently represent threats to the decades of progress achieved in the ability to survive, grow and prosper; (5) inter-institutional actions for prevention and response to all types of violence. Violence against children and adolescents has been a constant in the country in recent years and often is related to structural and cultural factors associated with patterns of upbringing and social norms of coexistence; (6) child nutrition policies and programmes to further promote healthier nutritional behaviour and food practices and prevent overweight and obesity; (7) strongly invest in local fundraising activities to attract private and individual donors.
"
LACR,Cuba,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The construction of output indicators for the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework outcome ‘Human Development with Equity’ showed that, although the designation of UNICEF as the leading agency in the results group is recognized, this leadership implies the inclusion of approaches by each individual agency, which requires additional time and analysis. Even though the RCO agreed on a methodological guide, the same guidelines are not being followed by all agencies in practice, as they have different approaches. 


Although the expected product was delivered, the process took longer than planned and required increased workload. It is recommended to speed up implementation of inter-agency work by making guides, templates, working tools and platforms available and using them appropriately, substituting separate approaches with inclusive ones, and ensuring the adoption of the guiding principles on business and human rights by each of the agencies.
  

In a year marked by the diversification of partnerships for the promotion and creation of protective environments, the existence of information gaps on the conditions in which a protective space must function and the minimal standards it must observe stands out, an aspect about which work was carried out this year. 


The need to promote ways for children to participate and voice their opinions, needs, priorities and expectations related to these spaces was also made evident. The resources on protective environments created in 2021 need to be communicated and disseminated during the coming year, and training efforts need to be carried out based on these materials.
 

The above is even more relevant with regard to the spaces dealing with adolescents who have committed acts that the law classifies as crimes, recognizing the country’s political tensions as a bottleneck for the achievement of results in this area.  
·       In a context characterized by a complex epidemiological situation due to COVID-19, the accumulated experience, the permanent exchange with the country’s authorities and the established partnerships constituted a strength and an opportunity for high-impact interventions, integrating other partners and reducing freight costs and implementation times. This allowed UNICEF to provide an opportune and effective response to the emergency, and to manage resources that responded to the national health-care system’s most critical needs. 


The relationship between the activities in response to the pandemic and the development programme allowed UNICEF Cuba to support the continuity of medical services, to complement efforts and to achieve more comprehensive responses to the problems affecting the health and well-being of children and adolescents.  


Digital platforms proved an efficient way to create technical capacities, reach families and adolescents and maintain dialogue and exchange with these audiences, adapted to the context. 


Due to Cuba’s achievements in implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the country’s specific context, Cuban media do not always focus on analyzing the gaps and challenges to be faced in terms of children’s rights. On the other hand, there is a need to strengthen the skills of journalists who either do not have proper knowledge of the issues to be covered, have a limited or preconceived approach to them or simply reproduce stereotypes. As a result, more virtual learning should be implemented to strengthen Cuban media capacities and to identify journalists who could become children’s rights advocates. Social media and world politics are transforming the way in which Cuba is interacting with other countries and how it is shaping its own society. Due to the country’s quite recent access to the internet, there is no experience in managing communication risks, and the approach tends to be defensive rather than proactive. In light of UNICEF Cuba’s collaboration agreement with the government, it is, therefore, key to strengthen the Country Office’s social listening mechanisms to mitigate risks related to its work, to engage Cuban authorities in feedback mechanisms, and to support the implementation of the Accountability to Affected Populations framework and activities."
LACR,Dominican Republic,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"One of the most important challenges in 2021 has been to achieve a balance between the accomplishment of good results and the well-being of staff through the different waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. The lesson learned is that the situation had to be evaluated periodically to adjust the requirements regarding staff presence in the office, to support staff to prevent COVID-19 and to maintain their mental health, to acquire stress management skills and prevent the burn-out wherever possible.

The second most important lesson is the need for UNICEF to be resilient and persistent in its efforts regarding important and complex issues by using proven, evaluated strategies, although at times it seemed that short-term progress was not likely to happen. For example, UNICEF efforts to put the issue of CM on the public agenda started in 2017, by developing research and implementing multiple mobilization campaigns, media tours, political advocacy and technical assistance, which eventually led, four years later, to the President enacting Law 1-21 in January 2021. This law, approved by Congress in 2020, prohibits, without exception, legal marriage under the age of 18. In December 2021, the President launched the public Policy for Prevention, Care and Response to Early Unions (EUs) and Adolescent Pregnancy. In 2021, 117,000 high school students aged 12–18 were reached through the UNICEF educational awareness-raising tool for EU prevention, and the social protection programme, SUPERATE, is working with girls’ clubs, supported by UNICEF.

Regrettably, there was a reverse in the advances made in the reduction of maternal and neonatal mortality achieved in 2019 with the support of the UNICEF’s MBGC programme. Even though the NHS was not fully implementing the methodology due to COVID-19 priorities, UNICEF continued lobbying and providing technical support to the NHS to prevent the figures from deteriorating further, and to maintain the achievements made at least in the seven hospitals which showed good results this year, until the initiative can be fully implemented again.

Good public and political positioning has further strengthened UNICEF’s comparative advantage to mobilize different actors, such as the government, United Nations agencies, the private sector and civil society. This has been essential in some programmes that require many partners working simultaneously to achieve the desired results, such as in the detection and treatment of malnutrition or providing access to COVID-19 vaccines for migrants or undocumented persons, preventing child deportation or supporting Venezuelan migrant children.

Anotherlesson learned was the need to continue strengthening mental health and psychosocial support in existing public policies. Episodes of depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts among adolescents became more frequently registered by the authorities. The MoE requested technical assistance from UNICEF to revise its procedures and prepare its staff to respond more efficiently to mental health issues. Due to the scarce resources for mental health in the public health sector, significant efforts will be needed to reverse this trend.

Lessons learned from the Real Time Assessment of UNICEF’s response to COVID-19 contributed to  increase UNICEF’s strategic positioning in 2021, mainly in evidence generation on the pandemic effects to advocate for children rights and inform decision making, and to inform the regional synthesis. According to the recommendations UNICEF strengthened its efforts to institutionalize some initiatives such as nutrition response in the NHS and the inclusion of emergency approach in the new social protection programme Superate.

Regarding the mobilization of public funds, UNICEF signed an agreement with the MoE in 2020, and, for the first time, UNICEF received funds donated by a public institution. In 2021, an addendum to this agreement was approved, and the MoE transferred additional funds to UNICEF for implementing education activities when schools were closed.

Regarding innovation, the NutreMUAC app, designed in 2020, is a tool for the registration of children evaluated and treated for acute malnutrition, as well as for pregnant and lactating women. In 2021, UNICEF designed a dashboard to provide real-time information on the number of children and pregnant and lactating women evaluated and acute malnutrition cases detected, treated and followed up, disaggregated by sex, age, eating habits, territory and the institution that provides nutrition services. In addition, a web version can be downloaded onto computers and mobile phones, and a version of the app has also been available since 2021 for iOS.

In relation to lessons learned, although the NutreMUAC app contains real-time data, due to the low skills of some users trying to register the app on smartphones, UNICEF had to provide technical assistance, training and close monitoring of health personnel performance and respond quickly to their queries, with the support of several partners.

Another innovation was the education accessibility approach in teaching methodologies and resources that were incorporated into the educational booklets produced by UNICEF as part of its support for the MoE’s ‘We Learn at Home’ remote learning strategy. The last two rounds of educational booklets produced in 2021 included kits of material to make the contents covered in the booklets accessible to all children, especially those with intellectual disabilities.

Regarding data, the innovative SEIA survey jointly developed by UNICEF, UNDP and SIUBEN to generate evidence on the socioeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continued in 2021, but this time with national representation of low- and middle-income households registered in SIUBEN. The innovation in 2021 has been in reaching out to the Ministry of Economy, Planning and Development (MEPyD), as the leading government counterpart, to start a methodological transfer of the SEIA data as a key tool to generate timely information in times of crises, mainly because it allows for rapid collection of specific variables, with flexible methodology, good territorial representation and adaptable questionnaires.

LACR,Ecuador,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons  learned

UNICEF advocacy to reopen schools had a positive impact on government decisions, but the country office became the only United Nations actor to do so, paying a political cost of being vocal when government decisions affected children’s right to education. As a lesson learned, the UNICEF country office needs to advocate for an increased participation of the United Nations Country Team in its advocacy efforts.
 
Actions to tackle malnutrition demand strengthening of primary health care and of early childhood programmes and this requires sustainable and permanent allocation of funding and resources. It is, therefore, essential to explore, identify and analyze the viability – legal, political and economic – of the various fiscal instruments that might achieve this. While allocation of resources is without a doubt a necessary condition to combat stunting, it is not sufficient on its own. Additional work is needed to improve efficiency in the use of resources.
 
Disaggregated data and evidence at national and international level facilitates awareness-raising and dialogue with key actors. Evidence helps shape an advocacy agenda through addressing the root causes of the problem and developing a preventative approach. This has been one of the major achievements of UNICEF Ecuador; evidence generation has provided a strong qualified voice. 

Innovations

An innovative pilot project proposes an educational reintegration strategy for adolescents with school lag that combines pedagogical levelling strategies. Jointly with the adolescent participation programme, the aim is to develop transferable and work skills that are relevant to adolescents as part of the education model. This benefits 70 adolescents who have been out of the educational system for more than two years and who, in most cases, have dropped out of education to work and support their families during the pandemic.dropped out of education to work and support their families during the pandemic.

LACR,El Salvador,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Innovations 
  
 
The country office has implemented innovations that have contributed to achieving important results for children. 
 
The country office has continued using new technologies and promoting innovative virtual training modalities. To strengthen the health system, the first virtual capacity-building course consisting of six modules for the comprehensive care of premature children was launched with the technical endorsement of the Universidad del Oriente. It targets health-care professionals at the first, second and third levels and has contributed to scaling up this specialized care throughout the country. 
 
The country office developed innovative methodologies to channel children and adolescents’ voices and provide them with tools for their self-advocacy: 


As an integral part of the support for national consultations to inform the United Nations Food Systems Summit 2021, UNICEF El Salvador developed a pioneer methodology to consult children aged 8–12 years and capture their perceptions and insights with regards to food security and nutrition. The findings of these consultations informed El Salvador’s Summit report that captured the country’s commitments to this critical agenda and was further highlighted during El Salvador’s General Assembly speech. El Salvador’s Sustainable Food Systems road map is also reflected in efforts spearheaded by El Salvador’s First Lady. UNICEF is part of the working group established by the government that incorporates the Ministry of Health, other national government and NGO entities, and United Nations system to support the country’s Sustainable Food Systems commitments. 


In 2021, the country office, in partnership with FLACSO, to continue promoting innovative processes for the participation of children and youth by first fostering and honing their core abilities to provide them with tools to strengthen ownership for their self-advocacy. Adolescents and critical country office-implementing partners have appreciated and positively leveraged this capacity-building process. 

The country office continued using its microsimulation tool to support the government in gaging the impact of its multidimensional poverty eradication programmes and measures, and introduced innovation through its development and promotion of the Strategy for the Economic Reactivation and Productive Inclusion to mitigate the effects of the pandemic with an emphasis in households with children and adolescents.  
 
Focused on the need to create a sustainable fiscal framework for investment in children, the country office leveraged its positioning and expertise to engage in evidence-based and data-driven advocacy. As the country moves forward with Bitcoin as a legal tender, the country office will closely look for innovations and linkages between monetary and fiscal policy for children and the performance of cryptocurrency. 
 
Lessons learned 
 
During the CPD 2016–2021, the country office identified lessons learned in evaluations, and programme development, that inform the new CPD 2022–2026 and provide recommendations to expand interventions in this upcoming programme cycle. 
 
Best practices and lessons learned drawn from the evaluations conducted during the CPD 2016–2021 informed the development of intervention models for the reintegration of children deprived of their liberty, the prevention of violence at the local level and a reintegration model for internally displaced and migrant returnee children that can be scaled up throughout El Salvador by central government institutions and municipalities at the local level.  
Lessons learned from the ""multi-country evaluation of UNICEF interventions on migration El Salvador contributed to strengthened: Coordination mechanisms between UNICEF and partners, stronger monitoring system, development of an advocacy strategy, and strength the intersectorality1.  
The CO participated in a Real Time Assessment of UNICEF’s response to COVID-19 which contributed to increased UNICEF's strategic positioning during the pandemic contributing to generating evidence on the impact of COVID-19, strengthen of multi-sector programming identifying local needs/opportunities and strengthening pilot to scale strategies, and development of partnership and fundraising strategies2. 
 
New opportunities to reach more children have arisen by digitizing programme learning modalities. The virtual or blended education modalities facilitate teachers’ training in previously neglected areas, including psychosocial support and socio-emotional education, which proved critical during the school closures. 
 
The country office consolidated its partnership with the Ministry of Education to strengthen specific programmes for the reintegration and retention of migrant and displaced children, evidencing the need for an intersectoral strategy that allows individualized monitoring and case management of returned and displaced children and adolescents to quickly identify and support those children to ensure their early reintegration into the educational system.   
 
To support the scale-up and improve the national reach of the Care for Child Development approach, health staff from municipalities have been trained to help the decentralization of attention to premature children and strengthen care for children aged 0–5 years. 
 
The exchange with Plan Ceibal of Uruguay and the Government of El Salvador has made it possible to incorporate a different vision of the use of technology in education and has contributed to strengthening the commitment to measure learning outcomes of the students and to adjust technology services to assure good quality services and to improve learning results. Investing in technology and improved school connectivity with the Giga initiative is crucial to reducing the digital divide. 
 
The education model for adolescents and youth in conflict with the law in social insertion centres needs to include a transition strategy to facilitate their effective reintegration into their families and communities by promoting their incorporation into higher education and developing opportunities to access formal education and jobs. The development of this strategy should be comprehensive, innovative, participatory and adaptable to the individual needs of each adolescent.  
 
Inter-agency initiatives constitute an opportunity to scale results-oriented interventions, lessons learned, and best practices through interdisciplinary approaches, promoting complementarity and the principle of competitive advantage. As an example, the collaboration with UNHCR as leader of the Protection cluster with UNICEF serving as co-leader and lead for the Child Protection sub-cluster has proved highly effective in successfully advocating for the inclusion of specialized child and adolescent protection services and their strengthening.  
 
Inclusion of psychological support coupled with a life-plan focus for interventions to support children and adolescents proved effective in strengthening ties to the community and is recommended for inclusion in all interventions targeting internally displaced and migrant returnee children and adolescents undertaken by the Protection cluster. 
"
LACR,Guatemala,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons learned
 
The power of technology to increase reach and accelerate capacity-building was evidenced more than ever, and UNICEF will continue to expand and promote the institutionalization of various online courses, eventually offered as massive open online courses (MOOCs) in the new country programme cycle. 
 
Focused investment in child-sensitive services in the social and justice sectors. IN Guatemala´s resource constrained context, it is critical to concentrate investment in interventions during early childhood and adolescence, and a particular focus should be on disadvantaged populations, especially indigenous ones. Investment in children, guided and informed by tailored public financial management (PFM) work, will be an overriding priority for the new CPD. Joint programming with other United Nations agencies aiming to cost essential services – with a view to engaging directly with the national budgeting process, such as the costing of the Great National Nutrition Crusade – will be sought to a much greater degree over the new cycle.
 
Preparedness for disasters and shocks. Guatemala is highly vulnerable to geological and meteorological events. Due to its under-resourced health system and insufficient water and sanitation coverage, the country is also vulnerable to epidemics. Likewise, Guatemala has high human mobility and is thereby vulnerable to social and political unrest along the migration routes. Investment in buildings systems´ resilience is critical for national disaster preparedness. It is also critical to address the root causes of migration and to continue collaborating with other actors, particularly IOM and UNHCR. Finally, given its poverty profile, Guatemala is also extremely vulnerable to shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring robust, shock-responsive social protection systems must be in place.
 
Social norms – especially those relating to violence and sexual violence, early union/adolescent pregnancy, and children in contact with the law – have been a persistent challenge in terms of gaining recognition for the shortfall in rights protection and establishing much-needed services for children. This is critical across families, communities and schools, health centres and courts to drive better outcomes for children and families in complex situations. UNICEF will continue and expand its support to Guatemala through C4D interventions.
 
Lessons learned from the ""Multi-country evaluation of UNICEF interventions on migration in Guatemala country Report “contributed to more comprehensive interventions.
 
The constraints faced in 2021 included a rapid growth in funding without a correspondingly rapid growth in staffing; a reliance on implementation through civil society partners for most programme areas; and the COVID-19 pandemic. With the approval of a new CPMP, UNICEF will recruit eight more national staff in 2022; diversify implementation modalities; and continue to support the Government’s response to the pandemic and support recovery and strengthening of population services with a focus on children. 
 
Innovations were integrated into the country programme and UNICEF onboarded a national staff dedicated full time to innovations. The organization had begun this workstream with a consultancy in 2019. 
 
Innovations supported: 
 
UNICEF and the National Secretariat for Science and Technology of Guatemala launched a National Innovation Award for Childhood and Adolescence, including the categories of education, and childhood and adolescence, to support innovative efforts to find more efficient solutions to the problems facing Guatemalan children and adolescents, based on science and technology. This national effort engaged key stakeholders from different sectors.  Innovations seek to make more efficient use of and increased access to health and nutrition promotion, prevention and care services for children under five, taking advantage of the use of technologies and the entire ecosystem of the country.

UNICEF partnered with the National Secretariat on Sexual Violence and Trafficking in Persons (SVET) to launch three online protection tools for children and adolescents, including a mobile app called “I connect without problems” and a counselling tool for adolescents in the form of a national virtual helpline called “Your Friend@ SVET”. This strategy seeks to make the internet a safe place for children to learn, socialize and express themselves. 

UNICEF supported the Secretariat for Social Welfare (SBS) to implement a Child Protection Information Management System (CPIMS+ Primero). With the implementation of innovative technology, the Government of Guatemala is taking a proactive approach to the case management of vulnerable children, including unaccompanied and separated children.

UNICEF began the implementation of a messaging service for pregnant women and mothers through mobile technology to promote behaviors for the prevention of child malnutrition. This covers five key areas of development – health, nutrition, nurturing care, safety and protection, and early learning. This activity supports the social and behaviour change strategy for the Great National Nutrition Crusade. 

UNICEF launched the Atlas on Childhood, which includes a detailed analysis of the situation of children at national, departmental and municipal levels in many development dimensions. A key innovation of the atlas was the development of a Child Welfare Index that allows the identification of those territories where children are furthest behind. 

UNICEF also promoted a substantial number of virtual capacity-building courses for police officers and judges. Overall, the organization promoted the full and equitable entry of Guatemalan children into the digital age, and the innovation workstream will be further consolidated and strengthened in 2022, in cooperation with key national players in the innovation ecosystem and sister agencies. UNICEF will also cultivate private-sector entities to support innovation for and with children across all five outcome areas of the new country programme.  
 
UNICEF focused on interventions to protect the rights of children left furthest behind. In the case of Guatemala, these are the early childhood cohort (especially rural and indigenous children) and adolescents (especially adolescents those out of school, in conflict with the law and pregnant girls), for whom services have been scant. Child and adolescent victims of violence have also been a priority, for whom there has been a significant gap in preventive and restorative services. UNICEF will continue to focus on these groups of children and adolescents in 2022 and will look for further opportunities to support the Government of Guatemala to create a solid institutional architecture with the capacity to protect the rights of all children and adolescents in the country.

"
LACR,Guyana,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons learnt: 
Working on prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse with civil society organizations:
The signing of the memorandum of understanding with the Surinamese Red Cross has been a major contribution to the training of staff, community workers and train the trainers in the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA) and response to child protection in emergencies. This strengthened partnership resulted in capacity-building in PSEA and child protection of more than 500 staff members, fieldworkers and community members.  This significantly complements and contributes to achieving the United Nations Country Team PSEA action plan in Guyana and Suriname.

Partnership with community based organizations during COVID-19: 
In partnership with Amazon Conversation Team (ACT), the office provided continued support to the five most marginalized indigenous communities in south Suriname, as a response to the COVID-19 emergency. Communication for Development (C4D) in local languages on COVID-19 awareness, preparedness and safety was developed and disseminated by local rangers along food parcels to improve dietary, education material and hygiene packages, reaching more than 3,000 people including estimated 1,000 indigenous children, ensuring continuity of learning and availability of sufficient nutrition as emergency preparedness and response. A media centre with digital material has been made operational to reach communities and make information digitally accessible. 
 
Innovations: 

Remote courts for justice for children: 
To respond to more than 3,000 reports of domestic violence, UNICEF supported access to virtual hearing rooms and safe spaces for court reporting in nine courts (in two magisterial districts). UNICEF also provided training to over 200 persons on gender-based violence (including court support officers, general public and professionals) as part of the roll-out of the services. This initiative was highly valued and became popular especially for children living in remote areas and during COVID-19 restrictions and lockdowns.

Power of social media: 
In 2021, thanks to our partnership with Facebook, the country office, for the first time, made sustained use of sponsored posts on social media platforms affiliated with Facebook. The partnership allowed UNICEF to disseminate messages to key populations in support of the Ministry of Health’s campaign to create demand for COVID-19 vaccines while also combating vaccine hesitancy. The use of sponsored posts helped to expand the organization’s reach, which saw an increase of 148.6 per cent over 2020. YOUTH TALKs, led by young people, also contributed to positioning youth and the issues that matter to them on the public agenda.

UNICEF youth volunteers as a change-maker: 
In Guyana, the country office initiated the UNICEF Youth Volunteers Initiative, which contributed to positioning the youth and provided a platform through the YOUTH TALK series to raise their voices on issues that matter to them such as mental health and climate change. Young people, including persons with disabilities, engaged in dialogue with the First Ladies on mental health in both Guyana and Suriname. Guyana is also part of the pilot countries for mental health, and it provides an opportunity to engage the youth to position mental health on the public agenda.

Additionally, the UNICEF Guyana’s Climate Changemakers youth benefited not only from training, but also received grants for climate action projects to turn their ideas into action. UNICEF also supported a conference on gender-based violence for young women with disabilities to strategize disability-specific preventative measures with key commitments for persons with disabilities received from the Minister of Human Services and Social Security.

The Country Office is looking forward to implementing the new CPD 2022–2026T and to continue to work with UNCTs in Guyana and Suriname to contribute to the full realization of the UNMSDCF 2022–2026.  
 

"
LACR,Haiti,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Recognized as one of the 13 countries with the most fragile contexts in the world, Haiti is in the midst  of a complex crisis shaped by a worsening socio-political situation, rising  gang violence and insecurity, developmental challenges and extreme poverty,  natural disasters and climate change. The 14 August earthquake was a stark reminder of the country's severe vulnerability to natural disasters.
  
In light of Haiti’s fragility and exposure to shocks, UNICEF needs to be fit for purpose to operate in this complex programmatic environment, and strengthening emergency preparedness and capacity remains a key priority. In the aftermath of the earthquake, UNICEF was able to count on the presence of its South Office in Les Cayes, which enabled the rapid deployment of surge teams and relief work using pre-positioned contingency stocks. As it embarks in the reconstruction phase, UNICEF has increased its footprint in the South, and capacity to manage construction work to rebuild schools and health centers.   
  
Delivering for children  starts with delivering for our staff. In 2021, amidst growing insecurity,  gang violence and a rise in occurrence of kidnappings, UNICEF staff received trauma  support together with regular counselling sessions and security awareness. An  international Staff Counsellor was recruited to promote a speak out culture  and conflict resolution. Thanks to its track record in handling lifesaving  medevacs, UNICEF was assigned as the UN system-wide Medevac Co-coordinator. 
  
Education will remain a key  area of focus in 2022. The validation of the first national  alternative education policy in 2020 opened the way for an improved educational  offer for half a million Haitian children outside the school system. A key  area of focus will be to strengthen vocational training and non-formal  education to improve the employability of young people. There is also a need  to strengthen the involvement of the private sector (chambers of commerce) in  the training and professional reintegration of adolescents.
  
A key lesson learned from cholera and, more recently, from COVID-19, was the  role of prevention and response to waterborne disease outbreaks. There is an  acute need to prevent outbreaks of waterborne diseases through  awareness-raising on hand washing, essential emergency WASH, and to better  prepare for climate-related emergencies through resilience and disaster  preparedness with vulnerable communities. In line with the evaluation of the  UNICEF WASH project in the departments of Artibonite and Center (2014- 2019),  UNICEF adopted a strategy to ensure the quality and sustainability of sanitation where water system users pay. This strategy will contribute to strengthen the capacity for maintenance of school sanitation facilities and hygiene awareness. 
  
  The 2017-2021 Country Programme evaluation was conducted to strengthen UNICEF  organizational learning, strategic positioning, and value proposition in  Haiti in line with the Haiti United Nations Integrated Strategic Framework  and a Humanitarian and development-oriented (nexus) approach. Key  recommendations included a greater focus on “public policies” (including  social policies, “social protection”, “fight against urban violence” and  “protection against sexual exploitation and abuse”) addressing the structural  causes of fragility in Haiti; the need to strengthen inter-sectoral  integration in UNICEF word to create systemic change; evidence and scaling up  strategies; the need to maintain a regional presence to work with  decentralized structures, (with a view to operationalizing national policies  at the decentralized level); and the requirement to include humanitarian  response success and quality benchmarks.
  
  The need for integrated programming is particularly acute in the metropolitan  area around Port-au-Prince, where vulnerable communities affected by extreme  poverty and gang violence have very limited access to basic social services.  While Port-au-Prince, Cité Soleil, Gonaives, Saint Marc and Carrefour alone  account for 42 per cent of unvaccinated children (penta 3), UNICEF is working  with the government, departmental authorities and partners to develop an integrated  programme on immunization, maternal and child health and nutrition, education  and child protection for vulnerable children and their families.
  
  Producing reliable data and evidence on the situation of children is critical  to advocate for and drive child-focused policies and programmes. UNICEF was a  key supporter of the government’s post-disaster needs assessments in the  aftermath of the earthquake. To support an integrated response in vulnerable  areas in the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince, UNICEF supported the  Institut Haitien de l’Enfance to assess health facilities in the region and  is working with the MoH to conduct a rapid health and nutrition assessment in  the metropolitan area in early 2022. A new SMART survey is also in the works  to assess the extent of the malnutrition crisis in Haiti. 
  
  Close collaboration and direct support to decentralized structures and  communities is a key pillar of UNICEF programming. In response to the  earthquake, UNICEF worked closely with departmental authorities. The  community approaches to total sanitation and the polyvalent community health  worker approach have particularly contributed to the achievement of concrete  results. The establishment of UAS will help operationalize the community  health strategic plan and decentralize the health-care system.
  
  In line with the country programme evaluation recommendation, UNICEF will  strengthen efforts to mainstream the gender dimension and youth  participation. In December, the Ministry on the Status and Rights of  Women in Haiti (MCFDF) launched and revitalized the Gender Thematic Table, in  which UNICEF takes part. Working under the Generation Unlimited (GenU)  initiative, which brings together the UN, governments and the private sector,  UNICEF has been strengthening its outreach towards adolescents and young  people. In 2021, UNICEF partnered with local NGOs such as Kids Club Haiti,  Ecolo Jeunes and SAKALA to help give adolescents and youth a voice. UNICEF  works closely with Digicel in campaigning to boost U-Report while strengthening ties with the MCFDF to better promote adolescents’ and young people’s rights.
"
LACR,Honduras,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons Learned
The inclusion of actions to address humanitarian crises in existing programme strategies was a comparative advantage in responding faster and maintaining the link between the humanitarian and development intervention areas. This combination was effective in ensuring rapid action while continuing to strengthen the capacity of government counterparts and civil society, and ensuring that children’s rights, public systems and services are increasingly universal and sustainable.   
 
Proper capacity for UNICEF-led humanitarian clusters is needed to ensure effective performance in general cluster coordination and information management.   The most successful cluster led by UNICEF was the WASH Cluster, staffed with the right combination of competencies from the beginning of the emergency response.
 
The presence of UNICEF staff at the decentralized level was key to ensuring close monitoring of the humanitarian situation and response. This contributed to the success of the early warning system, due to their direct interaction and cooperation with municipalities and communities. 
 
Emergency response planning based on a risk/needs analysis using the INFORM platform linked to a WASH prioritization matrix allowed UNICEF to reach the most vulnerable population in an informed manner. The close collaboration between UNICEF Honduras, municipalities and communities also helped to identify and reach pockets of vulnerable populations in affected areas. 
 
Some implementing partners from government and civil society had limited humanitarian response capacity, creating constraints for UNICEF at different levels. As part of preparedness actions, it is important to identify partners with pre-existing emergency response capacity in relevant sectors as a means of guaranteeing immediate and effective emergency responses. It is also necessary to design and implement a capacity-building plan based on the Minimum Standards for Humanitarian Response and the Core Commitments for Children in Emergencies. 
 
UNICEF and implementing partners made information on the services delivered and feedback mechanisms available for suggestions and complaints by the affected populations. These efforts helped to improve the relevance, effectiveness and quality of the services. Accountability with affected populations cannot be an afterthought but must be an integral initial component in the design of any emergency response strategy. 
 
Investment in prevention of sexual abuse and exploitation in emergency response activities by UNICEF and with partners proved to be a critical intervention in a country with relatively high rates of domestic and sexual violence, with zero cases reported throughout the emergency response. All UNICEF-implementing partners ended 2021 rated as moderate/low risk regarding sexual abuse and exploitation, as a result of the introduction of normative frameworks and the implementation of training of government and NGO staff by UNICEF. 
 
Integration between humanitarian assistance and WASH in schools allowed UNICEF to improve the WASH infrastructure in schools serving as shelters for populations affected by tropical storms Eta/Iota. Strengthening the climate-resilient WASH knowledge of local governments and technical teams is needed to ensure an efficient process and sustainability of practices.
 
To address malnutrition in Honduras, nutrition must be included in strategic government initiatives at the same level as, and integrated with, initiatives of other sectors such as health, education or child protection. The effective emergency response in nutrition was possible as a result of a robust community-based approach, with families and community networks at the foundation of the activities. 
 
In a country with high rates of violence against children, and in the current context of a full return to schools in February 2022 after two years of complete school closure and increased levels of exclusion and abuse against children, it is critical to consider school as a protective space (the only one for many children), where not only learning but psychoemotional needs are addressed and attended; where there is room for community and parent cooperation and participation in the learning process; where clean water and sanitation are available; and where infrastructure is resilient to climate and natural disasters.
 
In the area of prevention of violence in communities, UNICEF has been developing intervention models for replication and sustainability, including emotional recovery methodologies and the implementation of Rapid Response Teams for emergency situations. These models need sustained investment, which should include creating an evidence base that demonstrates their potential to render tangible results, particularly concerning social norms and behaviour change. 
In 2021, UNICEF Honduras developed its capacity to design and implement humanitarian cash transfer programmes (HCTP) through implementing partners. With adequate involvement of UNICEF programme and operations areas, it will also be capable of implementing HCTP without intermediaries, thus reducing indirect costs. To this end, in 2022, UNICEF will install the HOPE system and establish agreements with financial service providers. 
 
The lessons and recommendations of the ""Multi-country evaluation of UNICEF interventions on migration in Honduras” contributed to strengthen Honduras COM’s interventions by:
· Systematically integrating gender in all COM protocols.
· Reinforcing UNICEF’s intersectoral and integral work (Protection, Health, Education, M&E and Communications) 
· Strengthening UNICEF’s advocacy strategy on national and subnational COM public policies
· Improving coordination with national and subnational partners
 
 
Key innovations
Humanitarian Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) were implemented with partners and within UNICEF, providing flexibility when responding to sudden crises. RRTs were activated for rapid assessments and/or responses. This has led to making crises that, for various reasons, had remained low profile, visible.
 
The results achieved in outreach activities with CBOs and youth groups for changing social norms related to violence and GBV have been innovative and successful and will be reinforced in the coming years. The participation of these organizations in the identification and referral of cases through a software application designed for this purpose has also been innovative, and its application and linkage with the protection system will be improved in 2022.    
 
UNICEF supported four municipalities in promoting youth participation for climate change adaptation, mitigation and climate justice, through the training of adolescents and young people on basic climate change concepts and motivating them to conduct activities that contribute to climate resilience, thus achieving awareness of the adverse impacts of climate change in their communities.
 
A major innovation in External Relations and Communications was the collaboration with MTV and KC Social Impact, which allowed UNICEF Honduras to reach global audiences.  

"
LACR,Jamaica,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"     

  1) Driving change and innovation in Digital Health: COVID 19 Vaccine Information  Platform
  
The COVID-19 response provided a critical opportunity for UNICEF to contribute to the modernization and improvement of Jamaica’s health system.  One example was the support provided to develop and implement a  state-of-the-art digital vaccine information management platform that was  used for the roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccination programme. UNICEF’s  flexibility, responsiveness and strong global and regional network were key  to success. The highly specialized colleagues from the regional office and  Headquarters played a critical role by providing technical guidance to the  Jamaica Country Office, which does not have a dedicated innovation or Technology for Development staff. 
  
One of the lessons learned for the success of this project was the importance  of establishing strategic public–private partnerships, ensuring a nimbler  approach to innovation and development within systems such as health that are  generally apprehensive to change. This tripartite collaboration among UNICEF, the PSVI and the MOHW facilitated a quick and robust solution. 
  
Another lesson learned from the rollout of this digital platform was  the importance of change management when driving innovations. Beyond  focusing on technical aspects, it is imperative to understand the underlying  culture of the organization and sector that is implementing a digital health  platform. Understanding the culture and people, and what motivates them, is  at the centre of how change can be influenced. Celebrating incremental  successes and constant enforcement of the benefits motivates and energizes  stakeholders to progress to the next task. Transitioning an entire workforce  – backend and frontline – over to a digital system is a huge undertaking.  Expectations must therefore be managed accordingly. Through the cascade  training approach, so-called super users, or influencers, were successfully  identified to help motivate their peers to adapt. Fully engaging MOHW  personnel and health workers from central- to field-level early on was a key  lesson in the Jamaican context. Conducting systematic training and gaining  buy-in at different levels is critical, especially when introducing new  technology.
  
Finally, from the point of view of the UNICEF team, another key to the  success of this initiative was the fact that the UNICEF team established standing meetings, initially daily then twice weekly, with key members of  staff, ensuring a high level of synergy and internal support, which translated directly into a speedy response on the ground.
   
  2) External review of PSEA capacity of Implementing Partners (IPs)
  
UNICEF Jamaica brought in an external specialist to assess and strengthen  Prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA) capacity – both internally  and for our implementing partners (IPs). 
  
As per UNICEF scorecard requirements, UNICEF Jamaica conducted the assessment  of all IPs’ PSEA capacity in applying the instruments developed by UNICEF.  Our assessment found IPs to be generally satisfactory. However, in-depth  assessment conducted by the external specialist revealed multiple areas for  improvement – including among those IPs responsible for the prevention of  sexual abuse and violence. Generally, existing documents and procedures have  weaknesses and the process for investigating PSEA allegations is not clearly  defined. In 2022, UNICEF Jamaica will work to strengthen PSEA capacity both  internally and among IPs. There is notable difference between the assessment  conducted with UNICEF internal capacity using the existing instruments, and  the assessment conducted by the external expert. It may be beneficial for UNICEF  as an organization to revisit the PSEA system to ensure that PSEA risks are  effectively identified and addressed. The existence of the global roster of  specialists, which we sought support from, was also useful, particularly in a  context where the available specialized capacity on the ground is extremely limited.
   
  3) Emergency preparedness of the Bahamas
  
While UNICEF does not have a Basic Cooperation Agreement with the Government  of the Bahamas, UNICEF’s role in responding to the Hurricane Dorian emergency  of 2019 was recognized by the Government and key stakeholders. However, the  Bahamas is a high-income county and is therefore not considered by UNICEF to  be a programme country. Nonetheless, UNICEF is exploring with the Government  of the Bahamas a possible agreement modality that would allow UNICEF to  formally operate in the Bahamas in case of emergency, given the vulnerability  of the country to natural emergencies. With the support of the regional  office and HQ, UNICEF was able to maintain a consultant in the Bahamas to finalize  the emergency preparedness plan and establish stand-by partnerships. 
         
4) The need for a better synchronization of Planning processes

Country Programme Document (CPD) development is one of the most critical exercises within UNICEF and should take place in a way that facilitates alignment with the UNMSDCF. Given the delay in UNMSDCF development, there was an initial attempt to negotiate for the extension of the Caribbean CPD to ensure sequencing of MSDCF and CPD development, but UNICEF was notified in April that no extension beyond February 2022 could be granted. This left UNICEF Jamaica with a tight timeframe to conduct the consultation process and develop the Programme Strategic Notes and the CPD; and meant that the development of MSDCF and CPD had to take place almost simultaneously. This critically challenged agencies to focus and collaborate to develop UNMSDCF in a meaningful manner and stretched human resource capacity, exacerbating workplace stress caused by the prolonged COVID-19 crisis. 

This recent experience has highlighted the importance of coordination within and between United Nations agencies and of close engagement with government, as well as some of the challenges that can arise during this process, particularly under a tight timeframe.

LACR,Mexico,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF Mexico identifies the following five key lessons to ensure more effective implementation of the country programme in the coming years.
·       The need for learning recovery strategies to recover learning allowed UNICEF to position innovations such as the Learning Passport and Teaching at the Right Level. Their impact will inform policy pathways to harness these innovations to improve education quality beyond learning recovery in the short term. However, the lack of connectivity and hardware continue to hamper, the benefit of digital solutions especially for vulnerable children and adolescents, the benefit of digital solutions.. A lesson learned is that any digital learning strategy will still have to be complemented by offline modalities and low-tech/no-tech solutions to reach the most vulnerable children and those left behind in remote and rural areas.
·       The humanitarian WASH response during the migratory crisis exceeded the “traditional” Wash in Schools component, originally integrated in the education outcome. As work expanded in humanitarian settings, though, it became necessary to expand the WASH team in the field and to consider the strengthening of the team centrally. To be able to respond adequately to similar or prolonged situations in 2022 and beyond, it would be necessary to set up a separate WASH section that is independent of the education programme, especially given the possibility of expanding UNICEF’s action in health.
·       While child protection authorities (CPAs) exist in Mexico, capacities to provide response services and prevent violence remain constrained. Despite investment in seconding qualified multidisciplinary teams (equipos multidisciplinarios) within local CPAs, this was not considered a sustainable or systemic measure in the long run. DIF, on which CPAs are dependent, should have the same understanding regarding the mission of the multidisciplinary teams so that the teams are utilized for the objectives they were recruited for, and that there will be no frustration among the team members about the kind of job they have been expected to do inside a DIF facility. 
·       To be successful in influencing policies, it is crucial to create the conditions and wait for the right time to act. For example, not until its third year of mandate did the current government develop any policies on nutrition. This was mainly due to the context of COVID-19 causing government capacities to be overstretched. UNICEF was able to generate, document and disseminate the evidence on the impact of the pandemic on nutrition in Mexico and to use it to advocate improved nutrition policies for children. This eventually resulted in the development of a national strategy on the prevention of all forms of malnutrition during the first 1,000 days.
·       The private sector proved to be a strategic partner for the implementation of innovative solutions for the provision of temporary shelter for women and children surviving violence, as acceptance in established shelters is a complex and time-consuming process, often separating male children from women. There should be further explorations on how private-sector partnerships could contribute to programmatic implementation at large scale, beyond funding and possibly through advocacy, human resources and/or the provision of facilities and spaces, especially in humanitarian situations.

LACR,Nicaragua,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons learned 
Through implementing the response to the emergency generated by Hurricanes Eta and Iota, UNICEF identified the need to strengthen the AAP Groups of its implementing partners and develop more integrated community participation regarding humanitarian aid contexts. Partners should strengthen the implementation of appropriate mechanisms to ensure that communities are more actively involved in decision-making, can evaluate the quality of the response, and can provide feedback on how well activities are progressing. Strengthening AAP strategies will be a fundamental element of emergency preparedness work in the coming year.
 
UNICEF promoted synergies between water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and nutrition in the communities and among its implementing partners, whose isolated actions show limited results. Comprehensive WASH actions with the participation of community leaders through trained Drinking Water Committees ensured that people in communities had access to safe WASH services and received key promotion and prevention messages, including those relating to safe water management. At the same time, the timely diagnosis and treatment of cases of malnutrition facilitated community mobilization in favour of the importance of safe WASH management.
 
On the Caribbean Coast, water and sanitation coverage gaps have a major impact on child malnutrition, which is not perceived as a problem by the communities themselves. The impact of these gaps on child development and the need to include actions favouring child development through religious leaders was recognized as critical for behavioural changes. UNICEF’s presence in the area should not be limited to responding to the emergency but should extend beyond the current period of cooperation with institutional strengthening activities and the development of the capacities of the communities themselves to protect children’s rights. Furthermore, in the context of climate change and the area’s particular vulnerability to hurricanes, UNICEF and its partners must strengthen the emergency preparedness and help develop community resilience.
 
The alliance with women's movements was fundamental to ensure access to justice for girls and women victims of GBV, especially in emergencies. In the framework of the response to hurricanes Eta and Iota, the technical strengthening to the local organizations Nidia White and Wangki Tangni allowed that more than 5,000 women and girls had access to health, justice and protection services.
 
The ""Formative Evaluation of the Educational Communities Counseling Program"" helped review the (a) planning, organization and operation of the Program at all institutional administrative levels and (b) improve internal management processes, information flow, information use for program orientation and efficiency, resulting in greater and better participation of families in the learning model, and the articulation with other government initiatives, institutions and with the community network. 
 
Innovations
In the framework of the Eta and Iota emergency response, UNICEF established an indicator reporting and monitoring system based on a dashboard tool, which provided reliable, up-to-date information from the activities of the 13 implementing partners that are technically and financially supported by UNICEF. Thanks to this system, for the first time the monitoring of the response to an emergency, implemented by multiple partners in a complex geographical area, has been managed from a real-time automated platform. 
 
This has facilitated a flexible and precise response in the report, both for UNICEF and its partners, and has increased the trust of donors in the management capacity of UNICEF in emergencies, and, as a result, the mobilization of resources. The indicator reporting and monitoring system have become a benchmark for the internal United Nations agencies in Nicaragua. The model will be adapted to local and national government partners in emergency management, putting children and their families at the centre of the emergency monitoring. 
 
In a complementary manner, and thanks to this monitoring system, UNICEF is developing an emergency mapping system that allows geo-referencing of the intervention, the identification of vulnerability zones and the generation of risk maps identifying population centres, as well as identifying the interventions of different implementing partners on the map. 
 
The production of accessible digital educational material was kick-started in 2021. At the Latin American level, four countries took on the challenge of facilitating, within the Ministries of Education, the processes of jointly creating digital material and textbooks that are accessible for different forms of learning: for children with and without disabilities, and for children of different ethnic groups and languages, thus satisfying the learning preferences of all children. This year, a training process was conducted for the technical team that will lead the project, consisting of personnel from MINED and personnel from the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua. 
 
A Protocol for the Creation and Adaptation of educational material in indigenous and Afro-Caribbean languages was also created, an experience that led to an alliance with the University of the Autonomous Regions of the Nicaraguan Caribbean Coast, to better understand the particularities to be considered in the production of didactic material for ethnic groups, considering their cosmovision, cultures and languages. This protocol will be the basis of a protocol at the Latin American regional level. 
"
LACR,Panama,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"1.       UNICEF engagement with authorities and partners is key to influence legislation and budgets. The aim should be to prompt development, implementation, and evaluation of innovations at community level and at scale to ensure the translation of regulatory frameworks into concrete services for children and their families, with a focus on the most vulnerable.
UNICEF should influence policies and budgets to ensure all children have access to high-quality services while investing in innovative pilot projects at community level to generate the evidence/field knowledge needed to continue advocating for at-scale reforms.  A particular emphasis should be place on establishing a baseline, control groups, independent evaluations, and strategies to use the evidence generated to influence regulatory frameworks and investment in children.  Despite its limited resources, the Panama Country Office will endeavor to implement a model in several diverse communities to reach scale and test innovations in different contexts in Panama.  Specifically, in 2022, UNICEF will support the national government in the design and implementation of an innovative model for identifying and referring vulnerable children to community services.  This work will be done in close cooperation with national, provincial and local authorities, in partnership with civil society and academia, with the involvement of communities and children themselves.
 
2.       Measuring the impact of UNCEF’s advocacy (especially advocacy behind closed doors) and technical assistance remains challenging.
Measuring the impact of UNICEF’s upstream work remains a global challenge.  A good example of this lesson learned at country level was the intensive advocacy and engagement of UNICEF in Panama for the re-opening of schools, as well as its more than 20 years’ efforts for the establishment of a comprehensive child protection system.  For many months and years, it was difficult to report results and capture progress.  2021 was marked by national successes: the government committed to re-opening schools in 2022 and a law that establishes a comprehensive system was approved by the parliament.  However, measuring the sum of UNICEF’s contribution to these long-term processes is complex and requires the development of sophisticated approaches and M&E tools.
 
3.       UNICEF should invest in strengthening the humanitarian-development nexus in Darien, while promoting the sustainability of services by the national government.
UNICEF should strengthen the humanitarian-development nexus in Darien for several reasons.  The migratory crisis in Darien is becoming protracted and the government should consider integrating the emergency services and their funding into its regular planning cycle.  The situation provides an opportunity for Panama to strengthen its crisis management capacity, considering the impact of climate change and pandemics on the country.  Finally, this crisis is taking place in a province that suffers from significant development challenges, and the humanitarian response could be used to further develop social services for local populations.  This approach would support a more flexible response to anticipate and address the unpredictability of the migration routes and flows.
 
4.       UNICEF can strengthen private sector fundraising with a combination of local and regional providers.
The initiation of fundraising operations in Panama has faced many challenges in 2021 due, among other reasons, to factors related to the pandemic and the fact that UNICEF is a pioneer in this area.  Therefore, the Country Office decided to diversify providers in order ensure the sustainability of actions.  Due to the pandemic and its socio-economic impact, ongoing negotiations with banks and other potential corporate allies have been delayed until 2022.  Despite the challenges of this changing situation, the Country Office was able to initiate fundraising actions and closed the year with more than 200 individual donors willing to support the UNICEF program in Panama.
5.       An innovation in 2021 was the integration of country and regional administrative services to improve operational efficiency and increase the quality of services.
In 2021, the Panama Country Office and the Latin America and Caribbean Regional Office decided to integrate their administrative services.  Under the Shared Administrative Services (SAS), managed at the Operations Section of the Panama Country Office, transactions will be consolidated in order to increase efficiency and improve the quality of services, ensuring more and better results for children.  As of February 2022, administration, building maintenance, security, assets, transportation and communications with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be processed by the SAS."
LACR,Paraguay,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In the second consecutive year of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to respond to the increasing need for intersectoral cooperation to maximize impacts for children and communities in the most vulnerable settings, UNICEF made progress in consolidating its intersectoral territorial strategy. One of the main challenges implementing a close follow-up of territorial activities. We identified the need to define coordinated milestones across sectors and interventions to articulate an efficient territorial support and   more impact. Establishing internal programme coordination teams as well as interagency BOS implementation around specific themes of the cooperation has proven to be an effective and innovative mechanism contributing to a more comprehensive approach to implementing articulated programmatic actions. An example is coordinating teams supporting the implementation of VAMOS and Kunu’u in the same territories, to avoid duplication. Overall, these efforts have improved synergy between programme areas to implement the Country Programme Document and to continue strengthening internal coordination. 
A comprehensive, multilevel intervention approach, especially for the areas of ECD, child protection and health – one that considers capacity-building at the level of families, communities and institutions – led to more sustainable impacts in   changing behaviours.  Likewise,  an emphasis on engaging institutional and community stakeholders, including volunteers, with   knowledge of the territories has helped to promote community empowerment and to consolidate participation mechanisms and governance locally. Additionally, expanding or replicating interventions across different sector platforms has given evidence to the efficacy of delivering violence prevention interventions in combination with education. Examples of this include the use of the protection toolkit in learning support spaces in urban settlements in Asunción and Central and delivering COVID-19 prevention measures through WASH interventions.
Municipal clusters were central intersectoral platforms for UNICEF’s territorial strategy. They enabled the exchange of capacities and knowledge among local actors. The first effort to survey proxy indicators of local investment in children identified a relationship between these and municipal institutional capacities. UNICEF will create a methodology in 2022 to further survey local investment in children, to shed light on the role of local governments and promote local results-based management. 
At the policy level in education, the use of participatory methodological tools has been a significant means of advocating and advancing the inclusion of generally underserved populations. Theme areas that were not substantially included before, such as ECD, disability, and intercultural education, were reflected in the main thematic lines of policy. This represents an opportunity to continue the advocacy and the technical assistance to the Ministry of Education to ensure a participatory process in the subsequent policymaking stages, as well as to reach the children who are furthest behind.
Online and remote learning tools such as the Moodle platform supported by UNICEF and used by the Ministry of Education have contributed to transferring technical capacity-building materials and content to the ministry, as was the case of the Love for Reading strategy. This facilitated the replicability of the programme through teacher training courses already established. Online platforms also proved useful in reaching and training volunteers. A mixed or hybrid approach has proven viable for ongoing outreach to participants.
UNICEF and implementing partners implemented the KoBo Toolbox to strengthen monitoring and making timely adjustments to interventions. This has allowed real-time data gathering and the monitoring of the implementation of protocols and guidelines for a safe return to school. The tool provided instant feedback to inform responses or any mitigation actions and aid two-way communication with school communities, reinforcing their engagement. Use of the tool will continue in 2022 across different sectors and partners.
Another important tool developed with UNICEF’s support has been a roadmap mobile app which seeks to facilitate interaction between users and service providers of the VAMOS social protection system which will be fully implemented in 2022. 
A developmental approach to understanding the particular cognitive, behavioural and social characteristics of adolescence is not yet fully incorporated in the programmes of the Ministry of Children and Adolescents. Although child protection programmes and services are aimed at both children and adolescent populations, there is a lack of specific tools and training to work with adolescents in particular. UNICEF seeks to open new pathways to introduce a comprehensive adolescent development perspective. In addition to gaining better understanding of the need to strengthen institutional technical capacities to work with adolescents and generate specific data around the issues they face, an important lesson learned has been realizing that there are adult preconceptions around working with adolescents that hinder their meaningful participation. Adolescents are also increasingly demanding to participate in the decision-making processes that affect them. The U-report tool and the Jere program have been an innovative way to enable participatory environments and platforms for young people, with the potential for scale-up.
Supporting the participation of adolescents and youth organizations in the development of methodological tools, such as the protection toolkit as well as through the youth engagement platforms developed by the country office, has also proven to be a successful approach that contributes to the appropriation of the methodology by the beneficiaries. In addition, the participatory preparation of the National Voluntary Report constituted good practice, demonstrating UNICEF’s key role in ensuring and strengthening children’s and youth’s perspectives in it. This effort has been recognized by inclusion in the 2021 compilation of case studies of UNICEF Country Offices and National Committees.
Finally, changes of authorities and local government administrations amid the municipal elections affected decision-making processes regarding governments’ interest in implementing the child-friendly municipalities initiative. An important lesson was learned from making quick adjustments in response to a changing political context – to prioritize focused capacity-building actions aimed at municipalities that have already demonstrated interest in this initiative. Adolescent participation mechanisms were also crucial to support the initiative’s inclusion in the local electoral agenda and achieve formal commitment from municipal governments, as well as commitments from electoral candidates to fulfil children’s and adolescents’ rights. This represents an opportunity to strengthen accountability mechanisms and guides future advocacy aims and assistance to establish measurable objectives for children and adolescents.

"
LACR,Peru,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, political instability and volatility were prominent and the public agenda saw a significant change. It was pertinent for UNICEF to redefine its programme priorities. Adoption of flexibility to shift its approach rapidly was a pre-condition to continue making progress in children’s and adolescents’ rights.
 
Lessons Learned:
 
UNICEF has learned that promoting children and adolescent’s agenda is possible if we ensure a) the use of evidence in designing interventions, b) solid technical rationale to continue initiatives implemented with previous administrations, and c) keep UNICEF intervention ambitious and at scale enough, but simple as possible, so that it is easy to obtain buy-in. 
 
Collaborative work among areas at UNICEF have led to stronger results in policy dialogue and advocacy (on school reopening and vaccination), in programme delivery (overall support to COVID-19 response including US$ 20 million on procurement services), and consolidating existing alliances with public and private sector including media, to boost UNICEF convening power (i.e.  Launch of Business Advisory Committee) strengthening UNICEF’s public position and role as a partner of choice. 
 
UNICEF led initiatives have been scaled up and adopted with full ownership by government institutions.  ECD local management model piloted in 234 districts and institutionalized by MIDIS, Positive discipline programme piloted in schools, reaching 1.3 million children and nationally adopted by MoE, incorporation of WASH models into the National Plan, innovative training programmes (in adolescent health and education, inclusive education, STEM, or migrant children protection) becoming part public training offer,  institutionalization of an innovative mental health helpline, or scale up budget model for the Local ombudsperson's office for children and adolescents (DEMUNA) across Peru are good examples of this. 

The Gender Program Review and the gender PSN during the elaboration of the new CPD has improved the Gender Transformative Programming for PERU CO. This process was supported by the Lacro Gender team and counted with the participation of staff from all areas of CO, as well other stakeholders including adolescents. This exercise allowed us to prioritize gender results of the new GAP3 in the new CPD, focusing on the system of care for children and adolescents, empowerment of adolescent women, and change of gender norms for the prevention of pregnancy and early unions.

In relation with humanitarian and development nexus, UNICEF has learned, that humanitarian assistance and capacity-building strategies must be periodically adapted to ensure protection and life-saving interventions for children and adolescents on the move, who transit through multiple irregular routes. 

In terms of resource mobilization flexibility in fundraising strategies, diversification of channels and focus on retention has been essential to adapt to the new normality and fulfill UNICEF ambitious fundraising goals (US$ 5.6 million).

Regarding staff wellbeing, Management and Human Resources provided close follow up on the status of the mental and physical health of staff members and their dependents, consultants, and individual contractors, with active participation from the Local Staff Association. Days-off, individual and team coaching, were some of the actions taken to improve staff wellbeing. UNICEF contribution to UNCT initiatives on duty of care have been highlighted as a good practice, including UNICEF coordination of UN vaccination process.

Innovations:
As a consequence of COVID-19, there is a recognition of the importance of mental health for children and adolescents. UNICEF provided technical assistance to national authorities to develop innovative ways to respond to mental health issues. This has been critical for accelerating programmatic work, and also provide specific studies and services with MoH: a) The first-ever study on “Mental health of children and adolescents in the context of COVID-19”; b) A new mental health helpline piloted by UNICEF, that will be adopted by MoH in 2022; and c) Support to increase the number of community mental health services from 29 to 207 nationwide. UNICEF advocated successfully to highlight mental health needs of institutionalized children in the context of COVID-19 pandemic. UNICEF also helped position mental health at a global level, contributing with research and global communication materials at the launching of the State of the World's Children (SOWC, which included the case of a Peruvian adolescent). 
 
UNICEF is fully involved in two innovative policies and programmes led by the MIMP: a)  the National Care System, aimed to protect the rights of children and adolescents and unpaid caregivers (usually women), where UNICEF provides technical assistance focused on: i) the design of a governance model of the care system including legal and organizational reforms, ii) the design and implementation of a consultative process, an online-survey on care needs of children and adolescents and type of care services required; and b) a one of a kind initiative on  cash transfer programme for children who has lost their parents due to COVID-19 where UNICEF will: a) provide technical advice to set up accompanying support model linked with the cash, and b) design and implementation of its pilot in two regions in the country.  
 
UNICEF implemented innovative solutions at service level, such as Afinidata, an interactive platform for families participating in an early childhood programme in 36 health services, reaching 3,000 families in nine months. UNICEF also strengthened MIMP’s family-based alternative care model for children that lack parental care (with focus on migrant children) by implementing a targeted family recruitment strategy, engaging 33 particularly community-based organization in Peru’s northern border and Lima.
 
In terms of adolescent’s participation  innovative initiatives were implemented:  a) The preparation of a report and video for the Committee on the Rights of the Child, by 75 children and adolescents from 35 organizations; b) the School Correspondents Programme, an initiative implemented in alliance with El Comercio newspaper to give a voice and participation to adolescents, reaching  65,000 school children; c) technical assistance provided to national Ministries and sub-national Governments in Amazon regions to strengthen organized adolescent presence and participation in climate change governance structures; d) support to 22,000 adolescent’s participation and consolidation of one national and six local and regional adolescent participation networks. Overall UNICEF support in promoting participation reached more than 1 million children and adolescents of those areas indirectly.

"
LACR,Uruguay,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Redefining the strategy for working with subnational governments

The country programme that began in March 2021 includes a special focus on developing work strategies at local level, particularly on the outskirts of Montevideo and in departments on the border with Brazil. These places are home to the most vulnerable children in Uruguay. For example, child poverty reached 26 per cent in Rivera in 2020, while in some neighbourhoods on the outskirts of Montevideo it exceeded 40 per cent. The worsening health situation in 2021, as described in the first part of this document, had an impact on the lives of children and adolescents across the country; its medium- and long-term effects are yet to be seen. Moreover, in the departments that have a land border with Brazil, both irregular migration and difficulties for migrants to access formal jobs and housing increased, as reflected in the DTM study.

Activities on the ground are very important in terms of bringing UNICEF closer to situations in which there are very vulnerable children and also in developing scalable intervention models. At the same time as it began working to assist migrant families with children in partnership with IOM and UNHCR in cities on the border with Brazil, such as Rivera and Chuy, UNICEF agreed on strategic entry-points to initiate support for local institutions responsible for children. In the coming years, UNICEF will focus its work on these territories, with the aim of including children’s perspectives in the municipalities’ programmes. This will have two main components: training both local and national government officials in the rights of children’s and adolescents’ rights; and strengthening strategic planning and results-based management skills to improve the efficiency of existing inter-institutional spaces and fulfil plans for children and adolescents at the territorial level. It will also continue its work to support institutions responsible for receiving migrants with children and to prevent violence and sexual exploitation.

Focus on the most vulnerable children: A bridge between humanitarian and development work

Uruguay, a high-income country, has a strong health and social protection system with broad coverage that enabled it to respond to the shock of COVID-19 and be resilient to the pandemic. By increasing cash transfers, extending unemployment insurance, and having a public health system able to deal with the health impact, Uruguay has demonstrated that its system is robust enough to respond to a major humanitarian emergency. However, the impact of the measures on children and adolescents, especially the closure of primary and secondary schools (although of very short duration), had consequences for mental health and learning, just as in the rest of the world.

UNICEF had the space to develop and support several initiatives aimed at improving the situation of the most vulnerable children, which will continue. For example, together with the National Public Education Administration, UNICEF is implementing a school re-engagement model in Rivera and the outskirts of Montevideo to bring adolescents back to school. It also produced evidence on migrant children, children without parental care, and adolescent education and mental health, which will be key to reorienting state and societal support for recovery efforts. To guide future work, UNICEF began supporting the National Institute of Statistics to construct a multidimensional poverty line that reflects the individualized material deprivation of children, and to integrate administrative data into its statistics. UNICEF was also involved in strengthening the capacities of the early childhood care programmes of the Ministry of Social Development and the Municipality of Canelones that began in the wake of the pandemic but will be an integral part of long-term early childhood strategies.

In 2021 UNICEF finished the evaluations of three initiatives, that provided valuable lessons for the programme. The evaluation of the intervention model for non-custodial sanctions for adolescents showed that the model is useful but there is a need to improve its coordination and to train technical personnel in its execution. The evaluation of the inclusive schools’ network (known as ‘Mandela network’) showed the need for better data on children with disabilities and will be used to advocate for a inclusive education national plan. Finally, the evaluation of the effectiveness of food education materials on families' attitudes and behaviours captured families’ perceptions on complementary feeding, useful to update nutritional guidelines for early childhood in Uruguay. 

Uruguay has the potential to be an example to the world

As a high-income country with strong democratic institutions and a small population, Uruguay could showcase experiences that could be useful to the rest of the world. In particular, due to the country’s high levels of connectivity, Plan Ceibal and its coordination of the National Public Education Administration and the Ministry of Education and Culture, Uruguay has been a global example in the provision of digital and distance education. However, not all children are in a position to use digital platforms. In 2021, UNICEF secured funding from the Office of Innovation to address both of these challenges. On the one hand, Plan Ceibal will have the tools to ensure digital education reaches all children in the country; on the other hand, it will systematize the experience within models that will be easily exportable to other countries in the region.

The scope of this education project is remarkable, but the country undoubtedly has more experiences to show the world. The telecare model for families with young children, initiated by UNICEF with the Municipality of Canelones and now expanded through the Ministry of Social Development, will be one of the examples to follow closely in 2022. Supporting the Ministry of Defense to enable Uruguayan peacekeepers to be champions of child protection in United Nations peacekeeping operations and Uruguay’s Peace Operations Training Institute to become a regional hub for child protection training is another example of where Uruguay is a standard-bearer for children’s rights.
"
LACR,Venezuela,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Throughout 2021, UNICEF increased its operational capacity, rigorous data as well as advocacy communication. UNICEF has also strengthened data gathering and monitoring systems supporting operational and programmatic decision-making as well as maintained and create solid partnership and fundraising strategies. The Real Time Assessment of UNICEF’s response to COVID-19 showed the strategically position of UNICEF as a major humanitarian organization in Venezuela during the pandemic.
In terms of programming, the COVID-19 pandemic and emerging challenges accelerated the development, deployment and implementation of innovative solutions that support service delivery, monitoring and communication with beneficiaries. However, it remains critical to invest in alternative forms of service delivery, such as local solutions, to be more flexible and agile in responding to needs. 
The COVID-19 pandemic emphasized the focus on resilient and sustainable WASH solutions for children and their communities. Community participation and engagement promoted by UNICEF allowed the implementation of innovations to increase their adaptability to emerging challenges and to strengthen their response to climate change. It has been found that implementing WASH pilot projects in rural areas has helped in the development and trial of innovations and plans for future interventions.
The communication push of key messages and practices serves as a basis for complementing change and social engagement activities. Disseminating validated information through various channels  such as radio, social media, SMS messages and WhatsApp groups, allowed UNICEF to reach different audiences. Interaction with children from targeted communities and their families was key to obtain real-time feedback on their situation and interventions, resulting in the strengthening of proposals on how to address their needs in subsequent programmes. In 2021,  18,372 people in 23 states provided feedback to UNICEF.
Data collection and visualization, including the documentation of experiences and the overall knowledge management allowed for rapid, near real-time and cost-effective generation of evidence-based knowledge products. To overcome difficulties in accessing more representative quantitative and qualitative data, UNICEF identified the importance of increasing the use and sharing of first-hand data collected by partners. UNICEF has worked with the National Institute of Statistics as well as strengthening work with universities to gather and analyze official and non-official data on children status in different areas.
UNICEF’s lead role within the Humanitarian cluster fostered the coordination between Education sub-cluster members and the Education partners, leading to capacity-building on minimum standards of education in emergencies and the achievement of results in advocacy. This cooperation allowed UNICEF to have a political impact at the Ministry of Education level through the provision of technical advice, particularly on the road map for school reopening. 
The development of long-term agreements for the procurement of local supplies is a means of mitigating risks associated with multiple crises for service delivery and will help UNICEF and its partners provide a faster response.  Pandemic-related school closures and travel restrictions represented a challenge to the delivery of equitable and quality alternative learning opportunities for children. Remote learning activities were found effective at enabling children to continue their education. However, the methods used delivered mixed results for children. UNICEF prioritized those strategies that reached the greatest number of most vulnerable beneficiaries and had the most significant impacts, while continuing to adapt distance education strategies to meet the children’s needs. 
The prioritization of vulnerable groups in geographical areas is vital to ensure appropriate and on-time delivery of nutrition services. The distribution of PPE was key to ensuring the antiretroviral treatment of all the children registered in the national HIV programme. UNICEF identified that the direct distribution of essential supplies to health-care facilities avoided the disruption to the service, thus facilitating monitoring. UNICEF supported the MoH in the rehabilitation of one hospital ship and two river ambulances to improve maternal and child health in Delta Amacuro state. Normally the journey to transport patients can take up to eight hours by curiara – a typical indigenous boat. These innovations benefited the Warao indigenous population from the most remote areas, enabling them to access health care faster. 
Travel restrictions and other pandemic-related challenges hampered the delivery of child protection services, but also the ability of organizations to mobilize and support their communities. UNICEF acted fast to develop innovative ways to deliver multisectoral services through a mobile approach. 
To reach beneficiaries that lack stable access to internet, equipment or mobility restrictions as a result of lockdown measures. UNICEF introduced an innovative element through the availability of online and offline modalities in the GBV programme. The intervention also allowed girl adolescents to put in practice their leadership skills on the female empowerment and GBV prevention campaign that was developed online and within their communities. 
UNICEF has identified the importance of: (1) strengthening partners’ capacities in mental health and psychological support (MHPSS) in emergencies, as well as in monitoring and case registration; (2) sustaining MHPSS projects, AAP processes and end-user monitoring; (3) including the revision of safeguarding principles and specific variables in the Venezuelan context; and (4) establishing mechanisms to exchange experiences in AAP and MHPSS with international organizations. UNICEF will design a thematic and geographical prioritization strategy for the prevention of and response to violence against children, including those from the most vulnerable groups, and integrate risk analysis into future interventions. To improve programme design, the UNICEF WASH team is working on a knowledge management strategy, focused on retaining lessons learned, innovations and ensuring assessments are fit for purpose.  
UNICEF is building a methodological base that will allow better monitoring and understanding of the influence in the short, medium and long term of Social Behavior Change (SBC) messages. It is essential to invest in the generation of evidence adapted to the SBC strategy, considering the conditions of the local context where the available information is scarce, not updated and difficult to collection, which increases costs considerably.   
Lessons learned, and recommendations of the Country Program (CP) Evaluation will inform the design and implementation of the new Venezuela CP, helping UNICEF Venezuela to respond more effectively to the changing country context priorities and needs of the most marginalized children and their families."
MENAR,Algeria,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF Algeria is continuously learning from the COVID-19 pandemic which created challenges as well as opportunities for greater and more effective collaboration with all partners. For instance, the COVID-19 crisis response relied in turn on increased responsiveness of sectoral partners. At the same time, the crisis offered the opportunity to build capacity to respond simultaneously to short-term needs while continuing to work on long-term agendas such as the school dropout prevention programme, life skills and citizenship education and psychosocial support. 
 
The availability of up-to-date data for children in Algeria through MICS6 laid the groundwork for evidence-based planning in the development of the next UNICEF country programme and UNSDCF 2023–2027.   Designing a MICS dissemination plan moved UNICEF from making data available to the actual use of evidence in policy dialogue and design. For instance, the experience of the workshop organized with ONPPE on the use of the MICS for reporting progress towards the SDGs ended up creating further interest from national partners and NGOs and needed to be extended. The partial implementation of the dissemination plan also provides another important lesson, which is that dissemination activities are a full-time job and requires dedicated resources to reach a greater audience in government institutions, the academic world and civil society.  
 
UNICEF communication for development (C4D) programming expanded in scope and quality thanks to the close relationship with the MoH arising from the completion of the first KAP survey on the impact of RCCE messaging. Thanks to the trust built in UNICEF, the survey findings and recommendations, presented at the Scientific Committee with the presence of the Ministry of Health, will be critical in making timely adjustments of the messaging and addressing hesitancy about vaccination.  
 
Based on lessons learned from a past evaluation project in the social protection sector, UNCEF decided this year to engage in a feasibility assessment prior to starting the full evaluation the social protection programme in Algeria. The practice helped reduce the risks of engaging in a complex evaluation exercise without ensuring prior availability of data and commitment of the ministries involved in the evaluation process. As a result, the scope of the evaluation was adjusted to respond to the actual needs of government institutions before starting the data collection process. In the near future, this approach is expected to increase national ownership of evaluation findings and policy recommendations.  
 
Another key lesson learned relates to the country office’s planning capabilities within the new working conditions imposed by the pandemic. The new context highlighted the need for better collaboration between the operations and programme teams to improve efficiency, risk mitigation and compliance with rules and procedures. Strategic operations should enhance results-based planning and client-oriented services, particularly by strengthening synergies and systematizing satisfaction feedback surveys, with special attention to the challenging environment that requires strong capacity to adapt and respond adequately, efficiently and effectively. 
 
The next CPD (2023-2027) will  build on the lessons learned from implementation of the previous country programme based, in particular, on: (a) the need to improve the production and systematic use of evidence-based data and analyses regarding the well-being of children and young people to better understand the disparities in inclusive access to high-quality social services, boost advocacy and inform public policy; (b) the need to optimize and scale up promising digital solutions throughout the cycle through strengthened partnerships; and (c) the need to gradually strengthen UNICEF collaboration with other United Nations entities to further accelerate synergies and results for children and young people.
Innovations 
Since the beginning of the current programme, UNICEF has implemented several innovative initiatives across sectors. In the health sector, UNICEF continued to support the MoH in strengthening its Health Information System, which is among the key priorities of the GAP 2021.  The most prominent results of the collaboration with UNICEF are the ongoing digitalization of the maternal death audits, the equipment of decentralized epidemiology and preventive medicine services to strengthen their tracking capacities of COVID-19 contact cases, and the national platform for the organization, monitoring and supervision of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign.  
 
Regarding youth programming, UNICEF tested the implementation of the life-skills agenda through new partnerships with local CSOs. Building on the close work of the CSOs with the local authorities, the implementation of programmes such as UPSHIFT and the adolescent kit at local level bears the potential to inform national policies via a bottom-up approach. The different experiences with civil society are in line with the Presidential decree setting up a National Civil Society Observatory as one of the main pillars of change on the policy design process. Another innovation is the translation of the adolescent kit for expression and innovation in Brail to the benefit of visually impaired adolescents; it will be further shared with UNICEF country offices worldwide under the “leave no one behind” principle.
 
In the education sector, the school dropout prevention programme was implemented through a pragmatic training approach, using lessons learned from the past. The approach, based on the creation of in-school communities of practice, provides the capacity to reach practical and effective changes at the classroom level, instead of a traditional training-of-trainers approach.

MENAR,Djibouti,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"L’une des premières leçons apprises réside dans le travail programmatique dans le cadre d’une pandémie. S’il est incontestable que le devoir de protection est la priorité, la connaissance de l’épidémie a permis de développer des outils et modes opératoires permettant à chacun de se protéger tout en travaillant au plus près des communautés. La pandémie a également permis de remettre au centre la nécessité de renforcer les activités multisectorielles,. 
Plus spécifiquement, en 2021, la structuration de la composante « end Supply monitoring » a permis de mettre en avant la nécessité d’un contrôle de toute la chaine d’approvisionnement afin de donner aux enfants les meilleurs équipements possibles, tout en assurant la crédibilité des actions de l’UNICEF. Cette thématique concerne autant les petits équipements (sac à dos, matériel scolaire) que les infrastructures dont l’UNICEF a pris la charge.
En matière de nutrition, l'utilisation des services de la logistique du PAM pour la distribution des intrants nutritionnels a permis aux postes de santé de recevoir les produits nutritionnels continuellement et de pallier différentes ruptures de stock de ces produits. Suite à cette collaboration fructueuse, l’UNICEF a signé un mémorandum d’entente avec le PAM pour toutes les distributions des intrants nutritionnels.  
 
En matière de santé, le renforcement des équipes cadres du Ministère de la santé sur l’élaboration des plans d’actions opérationnels a permis à ces équipes renforcer leur capacité d’analyse des goulots d’étranglements du système de santé et de proposer des solutions idoines pour lever ces goulots. L’UNICEF va continuer à accompagner ce processus pour aboutir à un plan d’action opérationnel qui pour la première fois sera mis en œuvre. Ce renforcement et ce suivi permettra également au ministère la mise en œuvre de interventions du Plan National du développement sanitaire 2020-2024. 
En matière d’éducation, Djibouti a maintenu l'ouverture de toutes les écoles publiques depuis septembre 2020, un cas de réussite rare par rapport à d'autres pays. Cependant, en raison de la « normalisation » rapide de la scolarisation, seulement après quelques mois de fermeture massive des écoles, l'effort pour explorer l'expansion de la numérisation de l'apprentissage a été limité, en raison des besoins du MENFOP de se concentrer sur la prévention des infections et le contrôle du COVID-19 dans les écoles. L'UNICEF continue de plaider pour la nécessité d'investir dans les solutions numériques comme l'une des stratégies visant à promouvoir un accès équitable et inclusif aux opportunités d'éducation pour tous les enfants.  L’étude « croisée genre » a servi de base à la conception du nouveau projet pour piloter le concept d’Ecole Rurale Intégrée visant à fournir des services sociaux holistiques aux enfants et à leurs familles, y compris l'eau et l'assainissement, l'électricité, la santé, la protection, et une éducation de qualité. Ce projet est novateur dans la région et devrait présenter des études de cas et des leçons apprises en 2022.  Alors que le concept de l’Ecole Rurale Intégrée sera mis à l'essai en 2022, l'UNICEF continue de promouvoir une approche intégrée non seulement pour un impact direct sur l'apprentissage des enfants, mais également pour générer des avantages de développements holistiques pour les familles et les communautés. L’évaluation de la portée de l’initiative des « sacs solaires » a été menée dans deux localités (Bondara et Galina) en consultation avec la direction régionale du MENFOP et le club des ingénieurs professionnels djiboutiens (CIPD) qui illustrent l’acquisition des compétences des élèves des localités rurales ciblées. L'évaluation a trouvé des résultats positifs, car les sacs aidaient non seulement les enfants à apprendre chez eux, mais les membres du foyer bénéficiaient de la lumière générée par les sacs. 
En matière d’eau, assainissement et hygiène, dans un contexte où les mécanismes de coordination nationaux et infranationaux sont trop faibles pour garantir une réponse solide aux défis, de nombreuses situations inadaptées se sont produites tout au long de l’année 2021, comme des duplications, un manque de coordination dans les situations d'urgence ou une faible harmonisation des interventions. Une coordination à un niveau supérieur et intersectoriel devrait être établie pour intégrer les perspectives de l'eau dans la planification, la mise en œuvre et le suivi des actions d'adaptation qui favorisent la résilience climatique. 
 
Avec l’appui du bureau DFAM/NYHQ, la section opération de l’UNICEF est en phase de contractualisation avec des prestataires locaux pour l’utilisation des moyens de paiement innovants par téléphone mobile. Cette alternative va booster la mise en œuvre du Programme-pays en réduisant considérablement les délais de traitements des requêtes DCT, tout en évitant l’insécurité et le risque financier pour les partenaires d’exécution qui gèrent souvent des montants en cash sur les sites de mise en œuvre des programmes. Le bureau pays a saisi l’opportunité de la revue annuelle pour exposer cette nouvelle approche aux partenaires gouvernementaux. Le bureau pays s’est également engagé dans l’amélioration de l’environnement de travail au bureau à la suite des résultats du sondage GSS de 2020 en constituant un comité chargé de faire des recommandations sur la gestion de l’espace de travail et le maintien d’une culture positive au bureau tout en renforçant le moral des staffs. Comme première étape, un audit complet des locaux a été réalisé par un cabinet d’ingénieurs et les résultats seront analysés au sein du comité pour recommandation au bureau et formulation d’un business case qui sera soumis à DFAM/Field services pour avis et guidance. Le télétravail est une réalité dans le bureau grâce aux efforts déployés par le bureau pays pour offrir aux staffs une connectivité permanente ; l’accès à distance et sécurisé aux ressources du bureau ; ordinateurs portables. Un groupe telegram pour le personnel a été créé pour encourager l’interaction sociale du personnel pendant la période de télétravail. Les réunions hebdomadaires « stand-up meeting » ont permis au bureau de répondre aux questions relatives au bien-être du personnel, à la sécurité et à la sûreté mais aussi de clarifier certains processus de travail du bureau.

MENAR,Egypt,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The COVID-19 pandemic has clearly demonstrated the importance of robust and resilient and shock-responsive national systems, including healthcare systems, social protection, education, child protection systems, as well as communication systems that allow direct engagement with communities. These systems need to be able to withstand and respond to crisis to ensure the continuity of essential services to the communities, especially for those most vulnerable.  UNICEF continues working at the system level, further supporting the Government of Egypt in ensuring that the systems are resilient and shock-responsive and at the same time, focusing interventions where possible in the most vulnerable communities to ensure that the voiceless and least visible are not left behind. Crucially, UNICEF started to reap the benefits of a strategic shift from a predominantly service-delivery mode to more investments in systems strengthening and capacity-building for sustainable solutions and broader impact. This is paired up with aligning the reporting on results according to the GoE’s ambitious initiative, Haya Karima, to develop the rural areas of Egypt. This aims at accelerating key results for the most vulnerable children and highlighting UNICEF’s contribution to the national plans and initiatives. innovative approaches were developed, particularly regarding support to the healthcare system, provision of child protection services, girls’ empowerment, engaging youth and adolescents, learning and others.
UNICEF supported the MoHP in strengthening the PHC system and targeted its high impact interventions based on poverty maps and later expanded to Haya Karima areas. In social protection, the COVID crisis highlighted the need for UNICEF to expand its involvement beyond social assistance (Takaful and Karama), and support MoSS in its efforts to expand contributory schemes to cover more vulnerable families. To do so, UNICEF partnered with ILO who has the mandate and expertise to work on contributory schemes, as well as responding positively to requests for technical secondments on contributory schemes. To ensure that all children continue learning during COVID, UNICEF supported the MoETE in enhancing the use and effects of the MoETE’s remote learning platform, through contributing to the development of the Family Guide, a guide to parents on how to manage distance learning with their children during the pandemic, providing teacher on blended learning, and accessing on the utilization of the platforms through a nationwide survey. To ensure inclusion of every child, UNICEF has advocated for children without a national ID to access the platform, which translated into the discussion of technical solutions to secure unrestricted access for migrant and refugee children in 2022.  UNICEF also continued strengthening the child protection system through piloting the case management approach in more governorates and enhancing the capacity of the national child protection stakeholders, community-based child protection structures and mechanisms. UNICEF with these national and community structures ensured continuity of child protection services to adopt social coping mechanisms facing COVID-19.
UNICEF also worked on building and strengthening nationally owned systems for communication and engagement with the communities and people directly. Under the leadership of MoPED and in partnership with MoSS and MoHP, UNICEF supported the integration of RapidPro[1] with the national birth/death registry system. This allows real time engagement with the communities, including those most vulnerable without an internet connection or a smartphone, on COVID-19 prevention and response, registration of newborn children, immunization reminders, cash transfer conditionalities and tracking positive parenting behaviors among trained parents.  
In 2020 and 2021, UNICEF, through one of its research partners, used Computer Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) to conduct a ‘Real Time Monitoring’ of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a number of social indicators including the challenges children faced in terms of household income, violence at home, learning engagement among others. The survey also included refugees and migrants that allowed UNICEF and its partners to understand rapidly the different needs of these communities. A dedicated survey focusing on the learning engagement of children, including refugee children, which informed UNICEF and MoETE on the use of the national learning digital platform. Through these experiences, UNCIEF has set up the Learning Passport, an online learning platform established in collaboration with Microsoft, to serve the most marginalized children in Egypt, particularly 20,000 refugee and migrant students attending refugee community schools. Meanwhile, UNICEF launched a campaign to combat the new threats children may face in the online world, named Amani Dot Com[2]. 
Furthermore, pilot models through UNICEF’s support in partnership with national and other key stakeholders, proved to be crucial in advocacy efforts that lead to policy change and nation-wide scale up. As an example, the case management system approach established by MoSS, which serves as a one-stop shop for various services including child protection services, led to the issuance of the ministerial decree stipulating it as a national model for the provision of comprehensive package service under the same roof. This one-stop shop model was proposed to the Prime Minister’s Office as the model for Haya Karima villages targeting the most vulnerable communities in Egypt.  UNICEF is currently working on implementation of a variety of ECD pilot models including on-site childcare service, shared childcare facilities, outsourcing, and childcare allowance. These models are designed based on the business case study conducted in partnership with the Federation of Egyptian Industries (FEI) and ILO and are designed to be adopted by the private sector through demonstrating the pilot’s proof of concept and support of the FEI network. 
One of the recommendations of from UNICEF partners regarding UNICEF’s ongoing focus on girls’ empowerment is that more outreach to the local level is needed. UNICEF is the first UN agency to initiate a discussion with the Haya Karima Foundation to conclude an agreement to implement Dawwie initiative in villages, which is expected to reach 40 villages in four different governorates to engage 50,000 children and community members in its first phase only.

"
MENAR,Iran,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The key lessons learned in 2021 were on risk  informed and adaptive implementation including, more evident application of  cross sectoral approaches to respond to humanitarian needs given UNICEF’s  dual humanitarian and development mandate. The internal changes within ministries  after the presidential election is calling for rigorous advocacy on UNICEF’s  comparative advantages to support national priorities and plans for children  living in Iran.    
During 2021, All joint partnerships were  adapted to enable support to government’s response to the pandemic and ARC.  To refine and accelerate the planning and response, UNICEF continued to  advocate with relevant national authorities for availability of relevant data  on the new influx and initiated signing Programme Cooperation Agreements with  local and international NGOs.  
To ensure proper resource mobilization and  allocation and hence continuity of the implementation, UNICEF staff and  partners adopted a hybrid work modality with online events as well as  presence in missions where necessary.  
The operational and programming challenges in  2021 accelerated UNICEF’s application of change strategies, particularly on  social and behavioral change communication and on cross-sectoral  collaboration and convergence of resources and actions. Interventions were  re-strategized to be risk-informed and the office was retooled through  recruitments and surge support to better deliver emergency responses and  enhance emergency preparedness throughout sectors.
The gender-specific adolescent wellbeing  programme continued in the first quarter of the year, relying on the  expertise of the trained psychologists, the initiative under other available  governmental platforms related to HIV/AIDS prevention services to adolescent  girls and boys. 
UNICEF as the co-chair of Resilient Economy  pillar of the UNSDCF needs to engage discussion with Presidential Offices as  well as Budget and Planning Organization to play a more effective role in  social protection. 
Sanctions have had a significant impact on  offshore procurement and logistics processes for Iran Country Office, as  suppliers are not willing to acknowledge purchase orders from or ship  directly to Iran. Hence, creative solutions have been required. 
Approaching banks through the Operations  Management Team (OMT) and as a united One-UN facilitated banking, thereby  streamlining processes and easing bottlenecks.  In addition, the  recently established UN interagency collaboration of finance staff has helped  find solutions to sanctions-related issues.
UNICEF continued to pursue quality assurance  under HACT to identify areas of concern and propose improvements where  practices by the partners were not fully compliant or risk factors were seen.  Based on the observations by the spot check and the programmatic visit teams,  conducting a HACT training workshop – planned for 2022 – was deemed necessary  for all partners. 
An interagency committee on HACT chaired by  UNICEF was also established in 2021 and has proven useful in ensuring a  harmonized and consistent approach with partners that will be supportive in  addressing the challenging HACT agenda in 2022.
In 2021, UNICEF constantly  monitored the challenges pertaining to the programme planning and  implementation to inform the decision-making to adopt new approaches in the  interest of sustainability, higher impact and addressing emerging needs.
Securing Staff welfare and promoting  respectful workplace culture 
Emerging opportunities 
Given the geographical disparities increased  because of the double impact of the pandemic and sanctions, UNICEF needs to  turn focused at provincial models that can be scaled up nation-wide.  Using various situation analyses UNICEF needs to continue advocacy and policy  dialogue on sensitive agenda such as children living in street situations,  children in detention, etc. that are part of national priorities as outlined  in the approved children and adolescent bill. Additionally, considering the  exceeding barriers that CWD face in accessing education due to COVID-19 and  the economic downturn, UNICEF Iran adopted a twin-track approach in  supporting access to education for CWD: continuing to reinforce  disability-inclusive interventions, and mobilizing funds and supporting  disability-specific interventions such as better access for distance  learning. 
  
Adoption of the new Law on Protection of  Children and Adolescents (2020) and development of its executive regulations  in 2021, provides a valuable opportunity for UNICEF to advocate with relevant  stakeholders for adoption of a systematic and multi-sectoral approach towards  protection of children. UNICEF continues its advocacy efforts for revision  of the minimum age of criminal responsibility (MACR), definition of the child  and abolishment of the capital punishment through its partnership with the  Judiciary and NBCRC/Ministry of Justice. 
Through its eminence on social media channels  and the results of cooperation with the MoCIG, UNICEF could persuade the  Iranian state radio and television organization – Islamic Republic of Iran  Broadcasting (IRIB) – to request for close cooperation with UNICEF to  advocating for improving the lives of the children in Iran. Since the IRIB is  the only TV and radio broadcasting entity in Iran with millions of viewers  and listeners, including channels that are dedicated to children and  adolescents, this can bolster the awareness raising, advocacy and visibility  activities of UNICEF Iran.  
Innovations 
The UNICEF Iran Innovation Strategy 2020-2022  was developed using a portfolio approach updated with mapping of the  programmatic challenges and COVID-19 adaptations.  The strategy  includes but is not limited to conducting a baseline diagnostic analysis on the  2018-2019 Innovation Strategy, mapping challenges and priorities to potential  tech spaces and viable innovative solutions based on the localized  risk-informed criteria.
In partnership with Vice Presidency for Science and  Technology (VPST), UNICEF launched the National Innovations Challenge for  Children and Adolescents award which resulted in increased advocacy for  innovation ecosystem to address issues faced by children. The programme  introduced top innovative solutions developed by the startups and  knowledge-based companies and mobilized financial resources through  connecting them to the VPST.  
UNICEF widely disseminated Innovation Call  equity-free investments in the fields of Machine Learning (ML), Data Science  (DS) or Artificial Intelligence (AI) and provided technical support to solutions  from Iran to apply. UNICEF also facilitated the onboarding of the first  Iranian startup, Treejer – an open block chain protocol experimenting with  cutting-edge concepts – to unlock new opportunities in climate finance and  rural development, using UNICEF Innovation Fund equity free investment. "
MENAR,Iraq,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In 2021,  UNICEF conducted a strategic programme review to reassess the evidence used  and assumptions made during the formulation of UNICEF’s Country Programme 2020-2024  and to suggest relevant strategic, programmatic, and operational adjustments to  accelerate results for children within the post pandemic and fragile post conflict context.
The first lesson learned was to recognize that the evidence needed to inform these shifts was not always available. Much of the data informing current strategies is outdated, drawn from the 2018 MICS. The result is a number of key data gaps, particularly from an equity perspective. For this reason, UNICEF Iraq plans to develop a data strategy. 
In line with UNICEF’s new Gender Action Plan (GAP) 2022–2025,  the strategic review resulted in a renewed commitment to achieving  gender-transformative results through a coordinated lifecycle approach, to  reduce GBV and promote the transition of girls to secondary education. UNICEF Iraq renewed its commitment to adopt cross-sectoral approaches recognizing the intersectionality of gender-based violence and its impacts; this will be done through, inter alia, leveraging the links between schools and  gender-based violence prevention and response services, expanding communities  care programmes, building capacity around case management, and analyzing and  addressing gender-based violence risks across health and WASH interventions.  UNICEF also recognized the need to adopt an integrated approach to promoting adolescent girls’ wellbeing and empowerment, promoting girls’ secondary education and skills-building, child marriage prevention, adolescent health care and menstrual hygiene management to accelerate transformative outcomes.  A lesson learned was also the need to emphasize interventions aimed at addressing the underlying causes of gender inequality and discrimination, such as gender-discriminatory social and cultural norms, while also promoting positive masculinities through engaging with men and boys as allies, agents of change and gender equality advocates. 
  
UNICEF Iraq also renewed its focus on Early Childhood Development (ECD), encompassing elements of health, nutrition, stimulation, education, and protection. A lesson learned is the need to bring these elements together under a coherent, integrated strategy for ECD, which includes early childhood education along with health and nutrition interventions for children under the age of three, as well as child protection interventions related to birth registration, parenting practices and prevention of violence against children, and community engagement. 
  
Leveraging cross-sectoral opportunities and synergies to enhance digitalization in the post pandemic environment was also stressed, both for online learning purposes and within the context of system strengthening, including information management systems in health, education, birth registration and social protection. In addition, UNICEF recognized the need to further address the digital divide to promote equity across its interventions and reach the most vulnerable segments of the population. 
  
Communication for Development and Accountability to Affected Population strategies have been strongly integrated within all programmes, supporting effective community engagement interventions and capacity building of external and internal stakeholders on RCCE. These have focused on understanding behavioral insights that are impacted by social, cultural and religious norms. 
  
Building a coalition with relevant stakeholders proved essential to address the needs of vulnerable people in a comprehensive manner, while avoiding duplication of efforts. For example, the joint programme with ILO and WFP to drive the reform of the social protection system proved instrumental to strategically engage with relevant stakeholders to offer a comprehensive reform support package. 

In 2021, UNICEF introduced innovative advanced technology solutions for the on-site treatment of biomedical waste by combining shredding and sterilization by microwaves in one single vessel. This solution allows hospitals, healthcare centers, and laboratories to efficiently treat and decontaminate medical waste directly in their production site, in order to control and limit the risks of external contamination. This microwave sterilization solution, recognized and recommended by the World Health Organization and the United Nations for the treatment of hospital waste, allows, in 30 minutes, to transform them into uncontaminated inert waste that can then be treated through the same channels as household waste. So far, a total of 16 medical treatment units were installed and functionally operated in selected hospitals. However, the scale up of this innovation would require private sector engagement to ensure low-cost local production and maintenance.

Based on the downward trend analysis of the humanitarian funding situation in Iraq, the transition process in Iraq, with the overall strategy of scaling back the humanitarian support while promoting expansion of durable solutions under a development cooperation framework, is providing a number of interesting lessons. As the funding for humanitarian response shrinks, there is an impetus to make a tighter definition of humanitarian needs when finalizing the HNO and the HRP for 2022. However, this can lead to the exclusion of certain vulnerable groups falling between the humanitarian and durable solutions planning and fundraising instruments. The experience on the ground is showing that the humanitarian-development-peace nexus is not exhaustively served by the various instruments available. UN agencies and other relevant stakeholders need to be cognizant of this and conduct earlier and more realistic discussions to better define roles and responsibilities for meeting long-term humanitarian needs, encouraging increased responsibility of local authorities. 
 
As funding availability is expected to become critical while the needs for more systemic and sustainable results increase, UNICEF might need a shift in emphasis from mainly fulfilling basic needs directly to increasingly working with and through the government to promote the development of more equitable and inclusive policies and address system gaps and weaknesses in a more sustainable manner. This can be achieved through promoting system strengthening and public spending on issues related to children and young people. UNICEF must therefore accelerate its transition from service provider to technical advisor, increasing support for capacity-building and innovation, leveraging resources and partnerships for children, and promoting local ownership and sustainability. Also, as explained above, UNICEF can better engage with and leverage the private sector, not merely as sources of funding, but also as sources of expertise, as advocacy partners, and as partners in achieving results for children.

The above-mentioned lessons learned and innovations have been documented in the Mid-term review report to inform and shape UNICEF’s programme in the next years and beyond.
"
MENAR,Jordan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Another year of the COVID-19 pandemic presented challenges in the design and implementation of UNICEF Jordan’s programmes, but also presented opportunities for creativity and innovation. An important lesson learned was the need to strengthen internal systems and build the capacity of key staff members on how to become improved spokespeople on children’s issues, and how to better amplify the voices of most vulnerable children across all platforms. Effective programming necessitated embracing online technologies, relying ever more on local community support and building up the capacities of local counterparts. 
 
Good programming is reliant on good data, and so data collection continued despite the COVID-19 restrictions. In the COVID-19 context, UNICEF’s Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation team continued evidence-generation activities, adopting the ‘new-normal’ of engaging respective partners, clients, duty bearers and rights holders through virtual means, in order to effectively collect the relevant data. It strengthened its support to consulting firms that conducted research, studies, and evaluations. However, some key planned results, especially those relating to studies and evaluation, were delayed owing to the substantial number of these undertakings and due to limited capacities in research studies and evaluations on the part of the vendors and partners. The lesson learned was that more capacity both within the section and widening the net for strong research partners is imperative to move forward.
 
As well as strengthening its own internal structures and systems to adapt to the situation, UNICEF’s technical, humanitarian and financial support is now focusing more on system-strengthening. While already mandated by the current Country Programme, it became apparent that this would also be key to being able to operate effectively and continuing to achieve results. UNICEF supported and built up the capacities of key partners including government ministries, NGOs and CBOs including the National Council for Family Affairs (NCFA) and provided leadership and expertise as co-chair of the child protection working group. This has resulted in improved and better coordinated planning and response to child protection issues. A lesson learned from 2021 however, is that the NCFA will need more support in 2022 in its joint planning with the relevant line ministries and departments, and for their respective roles and responsibilities to be clarified, as inter-ministerial coordination on child protection issues is still rather weak. 
 
Technological and digital innovations provided effective solutions across a range of UNICEF programming. UNICEF’s ICT section installed software in tablets distributed to school children to enable continued remote learning. The tablets have pre-installed education applications and links to resources such as Darsak, Learning Bridges and Learning Passports platforms. UNICEF is able to upload additional resources through a mobile device management (MDM) system that provides the opportunity to continually improve the available resources, as well as track usage and other analytics.
 
UNICEF also realised the importance of equipping young people with digital and technological skills to provide them with transferable skills that will benefit them in terms of employability, life in the post-COVID world and become agents of change. 
 
The existence of a solid data management component for UNICEF’s internal programmes, including a feedback mechanism, adaptive M&E systems, and MIS (Bayanati) enabled flexible and responsive programme design of both the Makani and Hajati programmes, to better meet the emerging needs of the affected population. This was highlighted in the global case study on best practices of M&E systems during the COVID-19 response.
 
As the provision of water and sanitation services is a critical life-saving service to the Syrian refugee camps, UNICEF initiated business continuity planning during the COVID-19 pandemic with all contractors and service providers to ensure minimum critical staff and key supplies were identified and prepositioned to allow for any disruption in obtaining supplies needed for network operations. This step was vital to ensure continuity of services. UNICEF also continued to closely monitor and ensure availability of sufficient stock of essential materials and vital supplies for the operation of WASH systems (e.g chlorine, fuel, etc) in camps. 

There were notable challenges in the provision of child protection services, such as the inadequate government budget allocations for the provision of child protection services and social service workforce. Coordination among different line ministries and their contribution to the national child protection system in accordance with their mandate needs to be further clarified and strengthened.
 
 UNICEF works with relevant line ministries to implement its health and nutrition programmes at national and subnational levels through a consultative process, which can be lengthy and time consuming to build consensus. The COVID-19 pandemic made this engagement quite challenging, especially as a major part of government resources (financial and human) was directed towards responding to the pandemic. UNICEF engaged with government partners continuously and provided technical support where needed. It was a clear lesson for future engagement with line ministries that early initiation of discussion is important in order to receive the necessary approvals and guidance that allow programmes and project implementation to proceed in a timely manner.  
 
Lack of real-time data and information can still be a challenge to inform effective programming. To address this, UNICEF built a digital health information reporting system for peripheral, primary and comprehensive health centres throughout Jordan, which was handed over to the Ministry of Health and rolled out in pilot facilities. This will identify coverage gaps and inequities and help in evidence-based planning. Discontinuation of public health services during the lockdown caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic was a major challenge. UNICEF, together with other agencies, continued its advocacy for continuity of essential health and nutrition services and to avoid disruptions. 
 
For UNICEF Jordan adapting to working in a COVID environment has been challenging, but staff are now back in the office after a period when only remote working was possible. Procedures are in place that include PCR testing on site twice a week. There is an almost 100% vaccination rate among staff members, and rotation of staff office presence helps ensure a safe working environment. Effective support, follow-up and monitoring of COVID-affected staff is carried out through partnership with all UN agencies in Jordan. 
"
MENAR,Lebanon,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Innovations
Given the continued devaluation of the Lebanese Pound (LBP), the macroeconomic context, and challenges related to distributing cash assistance in LBP including crowding at ATMs, UNICEF provided Haddi cash transfer in US dollars, using a direct payment mechanism via money transfer agencies, making it the first programme to pilot dollarization in Lebanon. Based on the positive results of regular post-distribution monitoring and rapid surveys, the Integrated Child Wellbeing Programme caseload was migrated into Haddi for assistance in US dollars.
UNICEF has reached more than 100,000 individuals in Lebanon through Qudwa initiatives sensitising and empowering caregivers, children, youth, religious leaders, barbers, bartenders, pharmacists, beauticians and other community leaders to stand up for children’s rights through more than 440 initiatives. Qudwa activities support a normative shift in practices that are considered harmful for children and women, while encouraging behaviours and norms that promote their wellbeing, dignity, and equality. 

UNICEF updated its child level monitoring capability for NFE, maintaining a wealth of monitoring data on actual profiles and immediate outcomes for children in NFE programmes, including evidence of lessons learned, transparency and value for money. The customized approach has led to improved academic and social performance within NFE programmes and improved coordination, notably for cash assistance.
Mobile phone applications have been developed to extend UNICEF’s reach to vulnerable groups. This includes a wellbeing application for 6- to 11-year-olds to support them to identify child protection and GBV risks, and to provide tools to improve their mental health and psychosocial wellbeing. The Qudwa mobile application helps caregivers to track children’s developmental milestones, access information on child development and ways to support children, including non-violent discipline. Two applications have been developed to support routine immunization, one for caregivers to record children’s vaccines electronically and to receive reminds, and one for physicians to easily report EPI data.

A clinical management of rape (CMR) application has been developed and is available to public health staff. It provides offline, user-friendly content, summarizing the steps of CMR treatment in an age and gender sensitive manner, as well as guidance on soft skills to deal with survivors of GBV in a survivor-centred manner.
The development of the Nahnoo.lb platform has enabled youth to register and be matched to relevant volunteer opportunities near them. This provides opportunities for UN agencies, Government, private sector and CSOs to engage the most vulnerable young people in systematic and meaningful engagement and volunteer opportunities.
Lessons learned
The successful adaptation and delivery of programmes during the COVID-19 pandemic and in response to the impacts of the social and economic crisis on the delivery of government services has highlighted how crises can also present opportunities. For instance, the onset of the multiple crises focused the attention of civil society and Government on the social protection sector, providing momentum, despite the financial and political challenges. 
The changing context due to the multiple crisis, including the COVID-19 outbreak, has shown the need to revise implementation modalities. Whereas child protection activities were largely conducted on a face-to-face basis, COVID-19 restrictions, including national and local lockdowns, in addition to the multiple demonstrations and protests that affected the country, have meant that physical access to activities was not always possible. Child protection, in close coordination with sector partners, revised the modality of implementing key child protection and GBV services, including focused PSS, safe spaces, caregivers’ programme and community-based PSS to be implemented on a remote basis to ensure continued access to services. Other activities such as case management continued to be conducted on a face-to-face basis in the most urgent cases, taking all precautions into consideration.
Due to the financial crisis, private health sector demand and supply has reduced, and inability to pay for healthcare services has led to a decline in preventive and promotive services. This has reinforced the need to invest in and maintain a robust public health system. In particular, this has highlighted how immunisation services must be preserved to prevent outbreaks which would further complicate service provision. UNICEF is supporting MoPH to overcome current challenges and is supporting innovative solutions to minimize impacts. This includes a shift to solar power for vaccine storage, involving the private sector in free vaccine delivery, improving technology for data management and reaching the unreached through community-based organizations.
Due to limited data on MNCAH in Lebanon, especially on neonatal mortality and practices, UNICEF recognized the importance of supporting national evidence-building, including existing surveillance systems for maternal and neonatal mortality. UNICEF is partnering with academia to assess these systems and ensure availability of data to guide interventions.
Reflecting on of the scale of neonatologists leaving Lebanon, UNICEF observed the need for development of a unified protocol and capacity building exercise to support healthcare providers. UNICEF is teaming up with the Lebanese Paediatric Society to revise IMNCI practices. 

At the level of umbrella partners, international NGOs who have been investing in building the capacity of local CSOs have reported that partners are still in need of support at level of organizational capacities, affecting the implementation of the activities. This is especially the case with the need to adapt activities to the changing context due to COVID-19. Partners are continuously updating their organizational capacity building plan including direct and individual coaching. The upcoming period will focus on supporting partners to implement the activities through close follow-up and coaching. 
Following the adaptive and responsive approach taken in 2021, UNICEF is well positioned to address the increased vulnerabilities of refugee, migrant and Lebanese children and their families in 2022. UNICEF will continue to the progress of Qudwa initiatives, working to address child protection and GBV in more than 240 locations across Lebanon, through Qudwa hubs. The programme will focus on areas with high levels of children involved in hazardous child labour or living on the streets. Building on the success of the Haddi child grant, UNICEF has initiated design of a National Disability Allowance for launch in early 2022.

MENAR,Libya,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"During 2021, UNICEF revised and extended its Programme Strategy in line with emerging humanitarian and development needs as well as reflecting the socioeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak. The relative political stability of 2021 provided UNICEF with expanded opportunities to partner with the Libyan government in new ways. During 2021, UNICEF recognized that the progressive stabilization of Libya required a shift in programme implementation strategies, moving from a focus on humanitarian relief and support to service delivery at the municipal level to a wholistic engagement with national systems strengthening, including with regards to national capacity to respond to shocks and emergencies.  
 
Specific lessons learned on the nexus programming from the success of UNICEF’s Health programme in response to COVID-19 during the year illustrate how emergency response programmes can support long-term development efforts through (a) investment in building national health capacity and information management systems; (b) partnership with multiple humanitarian and development actors including  donors, agencies, civil society and private sector to ensure sustainability of financial resources; and (c) utilization of information collected during the campaign to contribute to improvements in population and health data. 
 
UNICEF has emerged as a leader in the national COVID-19 response, including with regards to the roll-out of vaccines and RCCE. UNICEF played a key role in coordination, policy and capacity development, supply and logistics at the national and local levels. During its lessons learned reflection, UNICEF identified additional opportunities for expanded engagement with the Government to strengthen the broader health sector, building on partnerships established during the COVID response rollout. During the coming year, UNICEF will continue to build on its success and further contribute to the Ministry of Health’s system strengthening for EPI and in other areas of maternal and child health. 
 
UNICEF was also able to strengthen national partnerships and expand risk-informed system strengthening. UNICEF capitalized on its strong partnerships with key line ministries to push for policy reform towards inclusive basic service delivery across a number of sectors benefiting development and humanitarian work. The lessons learned regarding the opportunities for systems building that were identified during 2021 will lay the foundation for programming during 2022 and beyond. For example, UNICEF and the Ministry of Education engaged in productive discussions regarding improved enrollment of vulnerable groups (including migrants and refugees) in formal education and the rollout of national distance education, responding to humanitarian education needs through improved inclusive basic service delivery. UNICEF is also working closely with the Ministry of Social Affairs to strategically strengthen the social workforce as an important building block of a national child protection system. UNICEF’s engagement in social protection system reform is a particularly strong example of the importance of this change in approach. Building a shock-responsive social protection system that is able to respond to the immediate humanitarian needs and welfare of the most vulnerable children and their families. To these ends, UNICEF worked with the government on the elaboration of a social protection policy, in partnership with development and humanitarian actors like the World Bank, UNHCR, UNDP and WFP. The roadmap was finalized and validated by the NEDB during 2021, laying the groundwork a joint policy vision. 

Building on these lessons learned and opportunities s, UNICEF will further strengthen the humanitarian-development nexus approach to programming during 2022 and the next Country Programme (2023-2025) to address the immediate needs and long-term vulnerabilities, including through risk-informed system strengthening and building national emergency preparedness and response capacity.
"
MENAR,"MENARO, Jordan",Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and continuous political and economic challenges in MENA demanded that MENARO identify strategies permitting it to balance its humanitarian and development roles while maintaining a focus on children. Lessons learned included:
·       There is a need to scale up equity-focused programming in education and strengthen national systems’ capacities to build resilient education systems that address the needs of the most disadvantaged children, adolescents and young people. Programming should include increased investment in disaggregated data, gender analysis and gender equity to achieve transformative results. 
·      MENARO should improve the emergency preparedness action plan by: 1) reconnecting preparedness plans with longer-term, risk-informed programming, 2) improving alignment with operational and security planning processes, 3) monitoring more closely compliance with the minimum package of services and implementation of actions, 4) rolling out decentralized preparedness for better contextualization and a bottom-up approach to preparedness, and 5) supporting efforts with resources and innovative approaches to advance the preparedness agenda.
·       The increased focus on the humanitarian/development/peace nexus during 2021 - and among United Nations agencies and regional collaboration mechanisms - highlighted the need to rationalize technical coordination and planning structures further.
·       MENARO should work to triangulate evidence for new insights to guide: 1) strategy that addresses individual, social and structural issues and is also informed by relevant behavioural theory; 2) a shift away from over-emphasis on messaging; 3) appropriate sequencing and calibration of demand with supply side, 4) preparedness; and 5) micro-mapping of disease incidence and vaccine availability. These changes will help address factors such as the ongoing pandemic response, vaccine hesitancy, gaps in demand and supply for vaccine uptake, and the data challenges faced by many countries in 2021.
·       Further work is needed to ensure the availability of quality, up-to-date and timely data and analysis evidence to pursue the delivery of services in the region’s uncertain and challenging context. The innovations and changes stemming from the Headquarters-led simplification initiative will contribute to advancing effectiveness and efficiency in these areas.
·       Continued engagement among COs, the RO and Headquarters is needed to navigate the complex interagency process and reduce the challenges associated with alignment of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework and CPD development. 
·       In regard to the Northwest Syria Cross-Border and Whole of Syria programmes, managing risk in a politically sensitive and complex environment involving remote programming requires constant attention, innovation and documentation. 
·       MENARO should evaluate and address the series of challenges that hampered the quality of humanitarian actions, including: 1) balancing evidence-based programming with operational and financial constraints, 2) maintaining consistent figures on people-in-need and children-in-need figures through inter-agency and MENARO needs assessments; 3) obtaining sex-, age- and disability-disaggregated data; and 4) ensuring that MENARO’s default and priority indicators are relevant in different country contexts. 
·       A lack of dedicated Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) capacity has slowed efforts in some countries where staff are overwhelmed and unable to mainstream AAP effectively. Additionally, the short-term nature of many consultancy and staff positions impacts continuity and contributes to limiting capacity for mainstreaming AAP during programme cycles.
·       Despite signs of improvement in the planning and monitoring of evidence generation across the region, the quality and timely completion of analysis and research still need attention. The RO should strengthen support to COs on prioritizing evidence-generation efforts, linking them with the regional accelerators, mobilizing relevant RO technical support and expertise, strengthening CO capacities in research methodology and management and creating rosters of regional experts to support analytical work in the region.
 
During 2022–2023, MENARO priorities will include:
·       Continuing to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including accelerating efforts to increase vaccine uptake in countries with very low coverage.
·       Strategically advancing regional accelerator results by mobilizing funds for COs; establishing partnerships, especially with the private sector; and promoting at-scale programming around MENA accelerators.
·       Establishing a MENARO portal that reflects data on children and data briefs on countries and accelerators. The MENARO portal will be embedded in the UNICEF website, and country and accelerators factsheets will be available to the RO and COs.
·       Strengthening risk management across the region, including developing a risk management strategy or action plan that will clarify risk tolerance, building capacity of COs for effective risk management, supporting higher-risk COs through joint programme and operations peer reviews, and conducting country-specific risk management deep dives.
·       Developing the 2022–2023 road map for strengthened humanitarian readiness and preparedness for MENA.
·       Addressing key areas identified in the last Global Staff Survey and Pulse surveys through activities promoting 1) diversity, equity and inclusion; 2) human resources transparency, career development and learning opportunities; 3) psychological safety; and 4) equipping managers with skills and coping tools to identify burnout and improve staff welfare.
·       Addressing feedback received from COs in 2021 via client satisfaction surveys on technical support and assistance provided by the RO.
·       Advancing work on MENARO’s efficiency and effectiveness in three key areas: 1) simplification and streamlining of work processes; 2) investing in knowledge management; and 3) strengthening staff management skills.
·       Strengthening UNICEF’s global position in the United Nations reform in areas such as: criteria for the disbursement of United Nations pool funding by United Nation Resident Coordinators office, synchronization of CPD development with that of United Nation Sustainable Development Cooperation Frameworks (UNDSCFs), using alternative options to UNDSCFs in special circumstances and implications on alignments with CPDs, and the articulation of UNDSCFs with integrated mission transition plans. COs in MENA will also take advantage of the efficiency agenda and position themselves as service providers to other United Nations agencies when appropriate, as per the Local Shared Service Centres initiative.

"
MENAR,Morocco,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"During the reporting year, UNICEF Morocco periodically took stock of the impact of COVID-19 on children in the country and used periodic programme milestones to reflect on opportunities and challenges facing programming, partnerships and operations. 
 
Most notably, the unveiling of the government’s new development model provided an important milestone for reflection. Produced in a wholly participatory manner, it summarizes current and emerging priorities for Morocco.  It highlights the need for further investments in human capital, recognizing that while advances have been made in access to education, quality lagged far behind. It calls for an extension of the health “offer” to encompass more services at the lowest levels of care. In noting that in 2018, some three regions accounted for 60% of GDP, it emphasizes the need to address inequalities and to accelerate social protection. Finally, it recognizes that young people, particularly young women, face substantial barriers to the labor market. This situation analysis validates UNICEF’s programmatic focus and gives important orientation to conceptualize the next country programme within the framework of the next UN Cooperation Framework.
 
These national developments and UNICEF Morocco’s discussions with partners through annual reviews and others point to some key lessons.  While acknowledging important contribution to the passing of key policies and strategies with impact on children, UNICEF Morocco’s largely upstream engagement will need to increasingly focus on the implementation of these strategies, treatment of bottlenecks, and sharpened support for those who remain most vulnerable at lower levels of service delivery. Therefore, UNICEF Morocco will work with partners on the appropriate mix for regional-level presence and action, national advocacy, and a targeted service delivery focus. Also, the country office has noted the importance of a more integrated approach to programming in the next year. More specifically:


In social protection, achievements in evidence, convening, capacity building, and advocacy particularly during the pandemic have paved the way for more technical support to partners around the implementation of key national strategies, most notably family allowances. The renewed national interest to professionalize the social workforce has highlighted the need to accelerate collaboration across social and child protection. Strong partnerships with EU and others will allow UNICEF Morocco to continue to support the Government to capitalize     on advances in the reform of social protection. 
To accelerate child protection results, UNICEF Morocco     will continue to prioritize the territorial system for child protection as     a means to standardize and converge services for children, including the     promotion of justice for children and alternative care. Direct     intervention in response to crisis around COVID-19 and migration confirm     an overreliance on NGOs and CSOs for service delivery. Ongoing focus will be required to place child protection within local governance, decentralization processes, and financing. In addition, with recently secured funding, UNICEF Morocco will deepen community engagement for social and behavior change.
UNICEF Morocco’s health programme will work to balance     its engagement upstream with the delivery of an effective maternal and     child health package at regional level, using progress in regional actions     plans, the modeling phase of the tripartite programme on health, and     assessments on WASH in health care facilities.  The pandemic health     crisis provided an opportunity to strengthen the health system for     maintaining the delivery of essential health care services specifically at  PHC level while reinforcing the quality and safety of care and community     participation in disease prevention and health promotion. The COVID-19     response is a good illustration of the contribution of emergency funds in     supporting broad health system strengthening beyond a public health     crisis. For example, efforts and resources invested in the deployment of     COVID-19 vaccination are expected to benefit the national immunization     programme and contribute to increased vaccine coverage in the     hard-to-reach populations. 
Conducting timely research during the pandemic and     UNICEF Morocco’s work at both national and regional level was strategic in     influencing decision-making in the education sector. Meanwhile, the     persistent number of children dropping out of school requires new     thinking, partnerships and approaches including a concerted effort to     reach and support the rural girl child. The pandemic has demonstrated a     significant digital divide, particularly for children residing in rural     areas. This combined with research noting that teachers felt ill-prepared     for learning and teaching digitally point towards a need to see how     digitally learning may help bridge gaps in access and quality. A     programmatic shift in line with national priorities to ensure both access     and quality in education will require multi-sector approaches that include     strategies in financing for education, community engagement, child     protection, and health. 
The role of the digital sphere was also pronounced     across sectors and will require greater attention; a priority prescribed     to by the newly established Government. UNICEF’s network online and with     partners allowed for mass communication that made it possible to scale     prevention messaging and response services to the pandemic. Often this was     done in collaboration with other UN agencies, key influencers, and key     population groups for more impact. In health the use of digital technology     for building technical capacity, disseminating messages, conducting     surveys have been explored under the Tripartite Programme as a result of     the pandemic. Similarly, through the UPSHIFT programme, UNICEF Morocco     learned how to adapt boot camps around digital literacy and social     entrepreneurship for the most marginalized young people. 
Finally, UNICEF Morocco is working to better define its role in bringing attention to the role of climate change and child development using existing work in WASH in health and in education and some initial advocacy work on the topic. Some initial funds have been     secured to help inform this work.

The pandemic forced new ways of working and encouraged innovation in programming approaches. Operationally, using the framework of the Annual Management Plan, UNICEF Morocco was supported to undertake a mix of in-person and online work by developing SOPs for simplification, ensuring availability of work tools, and the putting in place flexible measures to allow delivery of results. 
"
MENAR,Oman,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF in 2021 continued to embrace new opportunities arising out of the COVID-19 outbreak, while at the same time accelerating results under existing initiatives. During the reporting period, the Country Office also developed its new CPD 2022-2025. 

A major new area for UNICEF Oman since 2018 has been its Public Finance for Children (PF4C) work. UNICEF’s approach to PF4C was prepared and executed over several years to ensure its strategic relevance to the Government. As mentioned above, it culminated in 2021 with validation of its Fiscal Space Analysis (FSA) by Government officials. 

UNICEF’s approach to PF4C work offers some key lessons.   

During the initial phases of the PF4C strategy, it was essential that UNICEF position itself as a credible player in public finance management.  This consisted of several activities including networking, capacity building within UNICEF and of external Government stakeholders, and sustained advocacy.   

Through close engagement with relevant partners in the public and private sectors, UNICEF was able to identify its entry point to PF4C work and was successful in identifying the right policy questions to support the Government think through solutions. Rather than focus on children alone, UNICEF focussed on social sectors first, which created an opportunity to later focus on children specifically.

The importance of forging strong relationships with critical actors, such as the Ministry of Finance, Tawazun, and the Ministry of Economy, that UNICEF had not traditionally engaged, became apparent early on and allowed for the necessary joint collaboration as well as access to information and data necessary to carry out the analysis.

Throughout the PF4C strategy implementation, UNICEF Oman also continued to scale its capability in PF4C by training existing staff, hiring internal experts, and relying on UNICEF’s global network of PF4C expertise. This allowed the Office to further nourish its relationships with the Government in this new area and to demonstrate its ability to deliver significant added value to strategic Government business.  

As a result, UNICEF was able to make good on its promises and commitments. Going forward, the success of UNICEF’s engagement with PF4C will also depend on its ability to support the Government in finding workable solutions to its current challenges. A follow-up programme of embedded support to the macro-fiscal unit in Tawazun, will provide the opportunity to further work with the Government to formulate practical answers to the strategic challenges it faces.  
Recognition of the PF4C work prompted the Government to invite UNICEF to participate in the design of the new social protection system. This gave UNICEF considerable leeway to advocate for the development of a system that is flexible, efficient, comprehensive, sustainable, and integrated; that leaves no one behind; and that provides adequate social assistance and a decent standard of living for all. 

The redesign of the social protection system was designated a national priority of the highest order. This enabled ministries to work together effectively and efficiently, and the Government – especially the ministries of finance/Tawazun, social development, housing, labour and Awqaf (Ministry of Endowment and Religious Affairs) – demonstrated high levels of ownership and drive to deliver results. The new social protection system will be presented to His Majesty Sultan Haitham in the first quarter of 2022. The provision of technical support to the Government in redesigning the social protection system as well as continued support to mitigate fiscal consolidation are incorporated as continuing priorities into the new CPD.

Programme adjustments to accommodate emerging Government priorities in the wake of COVID-19 demonstrated the flexibility and responsiveness of the Country Office as well as that of its staff.  The ability of UNICEF to provide the support required by the Government continued to underscore its relevance in a high-income context, the strength of its technical know-how and ability to convene international experts by tapping into its global network to focus on high-impact, upstream activities. 

UNICEF’s experience throughout the year demonstrated again the importance of effective and efficient multi-sectoral coordination mechanisms to drive forward results for children. 
 As UNICEF is strengthening its engagement in the area of youth programming, also in line with the new CPD, UNICEF was successful in setting up a Youth Advisory Board (YAB) to ensure the systematic and meaningful engagement of young people in the decision-making process of Generation Unlimited in Oman. The enthusiasm demonstrated by the 15 or so young people on the YAB was most encouraging. However, it also became apparent that a more general governance structure is needed to ensure proper coordination and encourage ownership of the GenU work. 
  
The recognition of UNICEF’s work in new and strategic programmatic areas has led to the development of a CPD that is highly relevant to the Government’s Vision 2040. UNICEF will seek to build on these gains to accelerate results for children at the national level.

"
MENAR,"Palestine, State of",Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The protracted nature of the crisis in the State of Palestine has required a focus on strengthening the nexus approach to promote complementarity between humanitarian and development programming. This approach adopted by UNICEF and subsequent investments made on systems building, service quality and community engagement were highlighted as a key lesson in the 2020 WASH evaluation, as well as during the May 2021 escalation in the Gaza Strip. The essential WASH operations and maintenance supplies for water and sanitation networks prepositioned with the Coastal Municipalities Water Utility, as a strategic partner, in their decentralized warehouses across the Gaza Strip, as part of emergency preparedness interventions is a successful example. These supplies were utilized for real-time emergency repairs by trained engineers to some of the 290 damaged water and sanitation infrastructure units. Without these emergency repairs 415,000 people would have been left with limited water and sanitation services during and after the conflict. During the crisis UNICEF also provided fuel for generators and chemicals to complement the spare parts. 
  
Furthermore, the WASH evaluation highlighted the positive impact of the adoption of diverse implementation modalities, such as the use of e-vouchers delivered to most vulnerable households to promote their uptake of hygiene practices alongside the construction of essential WASH infrastructure and support to the continual operations and maintenance of infrastructure. The evaluation has also supported a structured policy dialogue with the national stakeholders on areas including cost recovery and operations and maintenance of infrastructure.  
   
A second example of nexus programming which bore fruit in 2021 was the UN joint programme, led by UNICEF on Health System Strengthening (HSS) in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. While the May escalation overwhelmed the health system thus jeopardizing the provision of health, nutrition and development services for children and their care givers, the system strengthening support around sexual, reproductive, maternal, neonatal and child health (SRMNCH) services helped to ensure health services were maintained. The support of UNICEF, UNFPA and WFHO helped to ensure the continuity of essential primary health care services, reaching 7,800 neonates in 2021, while these services often are not sustained in the peak of emergencies. UNICEF pre-positioned drugs in Gaza allowed the prompt response during the hostilities, giving time to establish an emergency supply pipeline due to the strict restrictions on import into Gaza during and after the conflict. Furthermore, this Health Systems Strengthening work has provided important entry points for UNICEF to foster dialogue between the government and civil society partners which further complemented the immediate health response to the hostilities. This policy dialogue has proven key in the State of Palestine given the fragility of service provision where the range of government services are limited requiring the procurement of more specialized services from NGOs, and where trust between civil society and the government is fragile. 
   
Finally, as COVID-19 crisis has highlighted weaknesses in the shock responsiveness of the National Cash Transfer Programme, UNICEF has worked with the EU, ECHO, ILO, WFP and other partners, throughout 2020 and 2021, to form a coalition to reinforce the shock responsiveness of the national social protection system, including the piloting of the first agency-led cash transfers delivered with MoSD to facilitate learning towards strengthening the existing system. In the first quarter of 2021 UNICEF reached 687 households with a one-off cash transfer, these households were directly affected by the economic impacts of COVID-19 in the Gaza Strip. In December 2021 UNICEF delivered the first of four monthly payments, under the Gaza Child Cash Grants programme, to 1,160 households directly affected by the May 2021 escalation. All work was undertaken with MoSD including the verification of the targeted households, and the feedback on the functionality of the system to MOSD through the evidence generated through Payment Verification and Post-Distribution Monitoring. Through this, UNICEF has leveraged MoSD to procure RapidPro as a tool for the real-time monitoring of national social protection payments. A Shock Responsive Social Protection readiness assessment of the national system is planned in early 2022 towards identifying other capacity building priorities. 
   
Evaluations have continued to provide important feedback on UNICEF programmes. The two evaluations in WASH and Early Childhood Development (ECD) finalized in 2021 led to management responses implemented with key national and international stakeholders. The continual engagement with stakeholders has led to better uptake for impact: the ECD evaluation findings, alongside the national ECD Investment Case (also drafted in 2021), were taken up by the National Inter-Ministerial ECD technical committee in advance of the drafting of the next National ECD Strategy planned in 2022. The findings of the ECD evaluation have helped guiding the new investment in ECD from the World Bank with the national ECD partners which have aligned with the ongoing work by UNICEF with the Ministries of Health, Education and Social Development.  
   
To make UNICEF programming more accountable and responsive to the targeted communities UNICEF is working with UN Agencies and implementing partners to improve policies and systems for Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) and the Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA). UNICEF State of Palestine is one of the six UNICEF country offices rolling out the global project on the Voices of Change aiming to enhance and scale up communities’ access to information and response to complaints and feedback, to build community trust and increase access to safe and reliable reporting channels on SEA. To date an AAP context analysis has been completed including a systems diagnostic of the targeted NGO partners’ AAP systems. Alongside this UNICEF is building agency specific systems including for direct community feedback, a data architecture as well as procurement of a data management platform to allow the secure integration of this data. Operationally UNICEF joined the Inter-Agency AAP mechanism, with feedback received through the inter-agency mechanism referred to UNICEF for follow up. Finally, UNICEF is also supporting a national NGOs call centre for the handling of sensitive SEA issues.
"
MENAR,Saudi Arabia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF’s role in the Gulf countries is unique, a dual mandate that includes programming for children within the Gulf and resource mobilisation for the Gulf programmes and globally working hand in hand.  A good lesson learned is demonstrating in KSA as UNICEF engages with the Government of Saudi Arabia on child online safety under His Royal Highness the Crown Prince Global Initiative launched during the Global Cyber Forum 2020.  With KSA’s keenness on being a key player in this field, a strategic partnership is being forged between UNICEF and KSA to advance this agenda both nationally and globally in multiple countries.  At the national level, the process of development of a National Framework on Child Online Safety supported with an action plan to operationalize the Framework including a social and behavioral change component was launched. Similarly, and hand in hand, the dialogue is ongoing to support similar work with KSA’s support in multiple low and middle income countries. This provides a great example of the interlink between the domestic programme and resource mobilization efforts at the global level. 
 
UNICEF’s technical and programmatic expertise, global network of best practice and agility to respond to crises came to the fore during the Covid-19 pandemic and validated the demand for and value of its technical assistance, capacity development and system strengthening strategies including in HICs like the Gulf countries. Key areas of support included mental health, child protection and supporting remote learning and blended pedagogy. Social and behavioral change and community engagement became evident as an area where UNICEF’s expertise is sought across the Gulf countries. While the GAO was able to secure support through the regional office and existing Long Term Agreements (LTAs), it was found necessary to build in this area of expertise within the office and resources will be allocated to address the increased demand.  
 
A good practice involved UNICEF working with other UN agencies in furthering its understanding of the complex issue of migrants and their children in the sub-region. In particular the experience in KSA, where the government has invited UN actors including UNICEF to undertake visits to detention centers and make recommendations for reforms is hugely promising. 
 
Moving forward, climate change is an area where UNICEF should consider positioning itself more purposefully. A number of Gulf initiatives are underway and provide an excellent opportunity to address and influence climate change issues in the Gulf, MENA and Globally.  KSA has recently launched the Saudi Green Initiative and the Middle East Green Initiative, both are very ambitious initiatives that aim to chart a path for KSA and the region in protecting the planet and contributing to achieving global targets in confronting climate change.  UAE will also be hosting COP 28 in 2023 which provides another milestone to influence at national, regional and global level. Qatar is also revamping its climate change plans and strategy in line with its “Qatar National Vision 2030.” The UNICEF Qatar team has already kicked off strategic discussions on alignment and collaboration and has shared global and regional plans with the Qatar Fund For Development and engaged all Qatari partners in many UNICEF’s virtual tours and workshops on climate change throughout 2021.  Qatar team is also working ona new innovative approach to engage the Education Above All Foundation and UNICEF Comoros on how to address the impact of climate change on children through education interventions. UNICEF GAO should look to engage at three levels: (1) ensuring that policies, strategies and plans are child sensitive, (2) advocate on the impacts of climate change on children and adolescents and the need to partner with young people meaningfully as advocates and change makers, and (3) Intensify fundraising opportunities at national, regional and global level in climate change and environment.
 
Within the Partnerships and Resource Mobilization component of the Gulf office, the Arab Gulf fundraising market is paving the way for UNICEF to engage in a range of non-traditional mechanisms to raise funds through ""innovative"" partnerships such as public-private partnerships (RewirEd, HOPE Consortium, SAFEIS /GWB, QFFD-Ooredoo), and building sustainable and strategic partnerships with private companies and organizations such as (DP World, Careem, Qatar Airways, Muslim World League).
 
A crucial lesson learnt has been that strategic leadership engagement pays off in unlocking and strengthening partnerships, and will continue to be of critical importance, particularly to leverage high-level events for increased income and influence. Engaging partners in UNICEF global/regional events and workshops as well as capacity building is highly valued and leads to strengthened partnerships. In addition, there’s a need to focus on regular, tailored engagement with public private partners on humanitarian and development priorities and funding needs as well as flexibility and creativity in capturing opportunities for in-kind support, in the absence of cash contributions.
 
A key recommendation of the recent evaluation is the need to strengthen and enhance global and regional visibility of Gulf partners. This will continue to be a top priority as it is key to increasing mobilization of resources and higher funding commitments.
 
In addition, the cryptocurrency market is an exciting new space within the private sector in the Gulf (particularly UAE) where UNICEF has the potential of securing significant funds over the coming years. 
 
Notwithstanding Covid-19 pandemic impact, much has been achieved in 2021. Results in Bahrain have been constrained by the lack of in country presence. Social policy activities have also been constrained by delays in recruitment of the social policy advisor. 

"
MENAR,Sudan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Sudan is a complex programme environment with  overlapping humanitarian crises, conflicts, political uncertainty, public  health challenges, and environmental hazards. To achieve results, the agency  relies on its comparative advantage as an advocate for children, convener,  and provider of technical support. As a result, UNICEF can utilize  its platform to develop and implement innovative programming for  children.  
UNICEF’s  intersectoral programming was key to implementation in 2021, particularly for  the successful reopening of schools in January 2021 after a prolonged closure  due to COVID-19. Technical support to school reopening and coordination of  the intersectoral response resulted in strengthened WASH programming at the school-level;  availability of vaccines for teachers; and cross-sectoral behaviour change  messaging and awareness raising through social media and other fora that  informed the public about vaccine availability and other critical  information.
On 20 October 2021, Sudan became the fourteenth  country to contextualize and launch the Learning Passport globally. The e-learning  platform was adapted to Sudanese Arabic and houses online versions of  government textbooks; more than 1,000 audio-visual modules; more than 250  interactive learning activities; and assessments to measure learning  progress. Interactive smartboards were distributed at 20 strategic locations,  including markets and mosques, in Khartoum to reach children that may not  have access at home.  In three other states 78 centres were  established, reaching a total of 24,500 students nationwide, in addition  to the more than 5,000 students who were able to access the Learning Passport  online in 2021. 
UNICEF’s consistent focus on  systems has contributed to maintaining its provision of lifesaving services  in the face of crises. Leveraging COVID-19 vaccine cold chain systems put in  place through COVAX enabled the delivery of vital health services, and Vitamin  A supplementation was delivered to over 7 million children using the platform  created to deliver Polio vaccines. This has improved efficiency while  ensuring the maximum reach of health services through a house-to-house  strategy. 
In 2021, the WASH  programme implemented two peacebuilding projects that involved significant  trial and learning. Since the projects are implemented in conflict-prone  areas of Darfur and Kordofan where implementation through government agencies  was not viable, CSO partners were engaged. Implementing has been slow,  particularly following the resurgence of tribal conflicts. Adapting to the  changing context allowed more responsive and targeted programming as needs  arose. Going forward, country programmes will need to build on the experiences  of these ongoing projects and develop a clear strategy to  incorporate peacebuilding and social cohesion systematically.  
Disruptions to the  MoIWR during the political transition and current crisis caused delays to  implementation. Diversifying partnership agreements could mitigate these  risks in the future, and multimedia advocacy and communication campaigns  should be employed to elevate sanitation higher on the national development  agenda.
The agency’s Child Protection programme found success by focusing its system strengthening on social workers. The Ministry of Social Welfare received 100 social workers into the civil service following a commitment from the Ministry of Finance to pay for these employees when resources are no longer provided by UNICEF. The long-term inclusion of these social workers will provide a sustainable improvement to the government’s child protection efforts.
Linking youth forums and informal community committees, which have high levels of legitimacy among the population, to the formal protection system enhanced reporting of FGM and child marriage. This resulted in a more robust monitoring system and improved public knowledge of existing protection and complaint mechanisms including, but not limited to, Family and Child Protection Units and Child Prosecutors.
 
The success and subsequent expansion of the Mother and Child Cash Transfer Plus (MCCT+) programme in 2021 demonstrates the utility of social policy as valuable tool for addressing the needs of children, and that UNICEF is well positioned to support the government in building an Integrated Social Protection System. This position derives from UNICEF’s programmatic principles for social protection system building: national systems and leadership, (progressive realization of) universal coverage, protection throughout the life course, and inclusive social protection, which align well with national priorities.  
UNICEF seeks to operationalize these principles through two key strategic and catalytic investments: 1) the development and implementation of a National Social Protection Strategy and Action Plan; and 2) the roll-out and scale up of a government-led MCCT+ Programme. UNICEF leverages these investments to build the foundations of the Integrated Social Protection System at four levels: 1) evidence; 2) policy, coordination and financing; 3) social protection programmes; and 4) administration and an integrated service delivery system.
The MCCT+ Programme is an operationalization of UNICEF’s programmatic principles which are now adopted in the draft National Social Protection Strategy. The MCCT+ programme also aligns with UNICEF’s mandate and comparative advantage. The MCCT+ programme is anchored in the whole child approach and has a well-defined Plus component. This makes the programme especially catalytic and integrative when compared with other cash programmes which have a narrower focus on cash as well as a poverty-based targeting approach. 
 
Particularly in the last quarter of 2021 following the military coup, staff were under increased stress as work and daily life were disrupted by political unrest and uncertainty. Staff remain the most important asset for program delivery, emergency response and operations for children. Through close collaboration with the Staff Association and actions such as visits from the regional staff counselor, UNICEF Sudan experienced one of the agency’s greatest six-month improvements in workplace culture globally based on the results of the most recent Pulse Check.
 
The CO will utilize lessons learned during the reporting year to inform annual workplanning in 2022. Responding to increasing needs in sectors impacted by the pandemic, including using the learning passport to improve access to education, and strengthening the PHC system to continue to reduce child mortality and malnutrition will be essential. Especially given the countries increasing political fragility nationally and locally, the CO will integrate peacebuilding across focus areas. To respond to the increase in multidimensional poverty, scaling up cash programmes and other forms of social protection will help us to safeguard Sudan’s children during this challenging period."
MENAR,Syria,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The UNICEF-led COVID-19 RCCE Pillar used an evidence base developed through a demand generation assessment. The first round of the assessment was undertaken by UNICEF in June 2021, surveying beneficiaries at UNICEF-supported service points. Based on the quality and importance of the data collected, the subsequent round in October was administered by MOH preceded by capacity development of MOH health workers to collect (75 staff) and enter (30 staff) data. The second round surveyed 10,346 respondents in 88 health facilities in 14 governorates. It revealed that 98 per cent of respondents had heard of the COVID-19 vaccine, up from 72 per cent in the first round. Seventy-four per cent expressed trust in the new vaccine, up from 56 per cent in the first round. Data from the assessment has been used to strengthen MOH COVID-19 vaccination communication efforts including key messages and dissemination modalities. UNICEF will support MOH to continue this assessment in 2022 to increase vaccine uptake as additional doses arrive in-country.
 
UNICEF partners also explored social listening through social media channels (Facebook and WhatsApp) in NE Syria. Analysis of 118 comments (rumours, positive feedback or misinformation) about COVID-19, such as impacts on pregnant women and children, fed into further action. For example, one UNICEF partner created a ‘Your vaccine is your safety’ Facebook page to raise awareness about COVID-19 prevention, receiving questions from the public and providing timely answers from the Directorate of Health.
 
After 10 years of conflict, no independent actors in Syria had conducted an analysis of government and aid spending in the sectors focused on children. To address this gap, UNICEF developed a Budget Brief to analyze the 2021 State Budget. Despite the current context, this analysis was crucial to gather available data on government and aid-financed spending in the social sectors. The analysis focused on 2021 State Budget, but put it in a broader framework, highlighting trends in social sector expenditure over the past ten years of conflict. This exercise was conducted internally and took seven months. Results have been process-oriented but critically important. The Budget Brief process led to (i) increased evidence; (ii) setting an agenda for research and policy engagement; and (iii) positioning UNICEF as a value-added actor in Syria, beyond the delivery of humanitarian aid. Key lessons learned include:
·       Public Finance for Children activities are possible in a complex humanitarian environment, even where there is no budget transparency.
·       Budget Briefs are a low hanging fruit that all Country Offices can develop to generate evidence, communicate advocacy messages, build partnerships and identify a research and policy agenda.
·       There is critical space for UNICEF to fill on budget and financing issues.
·       It is important to take risks and not shy away from difficult and sensitive issues.
 
The analysis provided a series of recommendations to help inform UNICEF future research advocacy and policy agenda, including the need to (i) conduct a comprehensive review of government expenditures on key sectors for children; (ii) assess the impact of spending on subsidies; (iii) assess the socio-economic impacts of sanctions on children; and (iv) strengthen aid monitoring and reporting. All of these will be priority research to inform the Office advocacy agenda in 2022 and beyond.
 
UNICEF established the CMS as a detailed tracking tool to understand and respond to the needs of children participating in NFE. The CMS tracks each child’s age, disability status, caregivers’ education levels, reasons for dropping out, transitions to different education pathways, education history, attendance rate and services received. This tool is used by all 14 partners implementing the SLP and tracked 38,000 children in 2021. The CMS has also been expanded to track 16,500 crossline students supported to sit their national exams and 7,000 students participating in remedial classes. A milestone in 2021 was the first local training for the use of the CMS for the formal Curriculum B in nine governorates covering 103 schools. UNICEF will further expand the use of the CMS in 2022 for community-based early childhood education in all governorates.
 
UNICEF continued in 2021 to support all of the sodium hypochlorite needs for the country to ensure proper chlorination of water distribution systems in all governorates. This ensured that 13.6 million people have access to chlorinated water, which contributed to preventing any major water borne disease outbreaks. UNICEF has engaged with the MOWR to assess options for an exit strategy away from importing of sodium hypochlorite and towards local production. In that respect, UNICEF has constructed one factory for sodium hypochlorite in 2021 meeting the needs of 1.8 million people in Damascus and Rural Damascus and has conducted a feasibility study for the construction of two additional factories.  
 
Most of Syria is witnessing significant electricity shortages, which are at their worst point since the beginning of the crisis. Electricity provision in most rural areas stands at only two hours per day. UNICEF is looking at possibilities of installing solar systems on water infrastructure that it previously rehabilitated. In 2021, SCO ‘solarized’ the production boreholes of one water system in Dara’a and is conducting studies to solarize at least two more in 2022.
 
An Assessment of the Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) System in Syria was conducted with MOE and the Institute European for Cooperation and Development to improve TVET in the formal and nonformal systems. The assessment identified factors that affect the TVET sector in Syria, through consultations with stakeholders including the private sector, Chambers of Industry and Commerce and young people. The analysis included a review of available secondary data, a market study and a workplace analysis including the assessment of current gaps, needs and opportunities that will be leveraged to design a framework on the way forward in consultation with young people and Government in 2022.

"
MENAR,Tunisia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The COVAX initiative represented significant additional and extraordinary effort for the country office which was already juggling its additional workload due to the consequences of the pandemic on programme implementation and staff wellbeing. In addition, as doses started to arrive relatively late in March 2021, considering the pressures faced in the country it represented a potential reputational risk for UNICEF, as the it was not in the office’s  control neither the overall availability of vaccines from the global vaccine supply chain nor the possibility to give to all COVAX donors the necessary visibility  and recognition, which was primarily managed at global level.  This required additional strategic efforts to ensure adequate logistic support, advocacy and communication, as well as managing when possible the necessary visibility for key donors, in particular for the doses-sharing mechanism of COVAX. This was particularly challenging as the situation was constantly evolving and required maximum flexibility to adjust to the office’s priorities. Looking back over the year, the initiative has however paid off in terms of the high number of vaccines it was able to mobilize, and lives saved, the strong support provided to the Tunisian government and particularly to the Ministry of Health, and the solid relationships built or consolidated with all partners and donors as a result. Indeed, the  dose-sharing mechanism provided significant relief to Tunisia and helped the country to rapidly scale-up vaccination rates.
  
On the other hand, the pandemic and introduction of the COVID-19 vaccine has also shown the importance of solid health sector coordination mechanisms, including health partners coordination by the government, even in middle-income countries like Tunisia, to ensure adequate preparedness and response capacities. Many partners have responded positively to the COVID-19 crisis in mid-2021, providing equipment, personal protective equipment etc. and the multiple support and efforts could have been more effective with stronger coordination at all levels.
  
On another positive note, the partnership with Scouts, mobilising over 5,100 volunteers on COVID-19 prevention and the vaccine, was particularly effective. In response to low registration levels for COVID-19 vaccination in  rural areas, UNICEF mobilised the Scouts to support people with their registration on the Ministry of Health digital vaccination platform (https://www.evax.tn/ar/index.html), and after one month the  number of registrations exceeded 3 million, an increase of more than 300% compared to registrations before the launch of the ""Talki7"" campaign.
   
In  terms of innovation, in continuity with its support for quality data and  effective routine vaccine management, UNICEF started the pilot introduction  of a single e-vaccination card and digital data reporting platform (TUNeVACC) in 2021 in Sousse and Kasserine, with two selected Primary Health Care  Centres in both Governorates. The TUNeVACC platform enables the registration of children, vaccine stock management and data reporting. QR codes included  in the vaccination card can be scanned in the platform to access personal data. The platform also includes an immunization schedule and is set up to  send a reminder message to parents' phones one week before the scheduled vaccination date of their child. All the vaccinators of the pilot centres received tablets to have access to the TUNeVACC platform and began using these tools on 1 December 2021. The pilot testing will allow for feedback and resolution of usability issues before the expected scale up of the  platform. 
  
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has provided an opportunity to  highlight the importance of the WASH sector and strengthen work around sector  data, coordination, and fundraising. This is also an opportune time for  UNICEF as WASH is among the new areas of focus of the new UNSDCF and UNICEF  CPD. In terms of innovations in this area, in 2021 UNICEF has supported the  introduction the Kobotoolbox to modernise and digitalize data collection in  public institutions through the WASH assessment. The use of online platforms  enables the digitalisation of data from the data collection stage, improving  efficiency, reliability and replicability of the process over time as already shown by the replication of surveys by the ministries of Education, Health and Women to other areas.
  
Under the positive parenting programme, a barber shop in Jendouba is successfully teaching male clients about positive parenting techniques, reaching fathers, fathers-to-be and grandfathers with messaging on how to  better connect with and be there for their children. This experience was identified for bringing interesting insights and potential replication.
         
A situation analysis of the private sector was launched in 2021 to identify opportunities to advance the rights of children in Tunisia. The exercise enabled UNICEF to undertake advocacy on child right issues and raise awareness about the challenges facing children also with the private sector. It also led to the country office getting an invitation to the Chief Executive Officers Arab Institute Annual high-level private sector event, in which UNICEF was the only UN agency invited to take part in a High Level Panel to address the issue of future opportunities for young people. 
 
Finally, UNICEF’s strong technical support and drive for studies to enable holistic planning and the identification of root causes to challenges, as well as the responsiveness of the Country Office’s support provided as part of the national COVID-19 response, are appreciated by the Government and donors alike, representing a strong advocacy tool for fund mobilization. 

"
MENAR,Yemen,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"To achieve better results and to holistically address the needs of children in Yemen, substantial efforts were made to integrate sectors to improve impact and service coverage. Under Emergency Health and Nutrition Project (EHNP), WASH services were integrated both at facility and community level. Integrated nutrition response, funded primarily by the Famine Relief Fund, brought together, health, WASH and cash assistance. Programmatic intersects between child protection/education and health included integrated approaches to provide psychosocial support to children and their caregivers accessing health facilities and in schools. Vulnerable children were identified through experienced social workers visiting health facilities regularly and were referred and provided with critical child protection services.
 
The integrated approaches helped to maximize results for children, providing quality services while accessing more vulnerable children. However, putting in place such integrated programmes requires an extended period of coordination and harmonization across multiple sections. This is challenging to implement with short-term funding and certain conditionalities of available funding. Other challenges to implement this approach is the uneven availability of partners geographically and limited capacity of some key partners. 

In 2021, UNICEF reviewed the effectiveness of the Rapid Response Team (RRTs) response with the support of an external Epidemiologist. A detailed analysis of the RRTs system was undertaken and based on the findings, corrective measures were put in place, aiming at perfecting the response while dis-associating Acute Water Diarrhoea (AWD) cases from suspected cholera cases. The RRT’ roles and responsibilities were also revised to enable the expansion of the Crisis and Disasters Response Sustainable Committees’ (CDRSCs) engagement at local level. The revision resulted in a reduction of the deployment of the RRTs by 50 per cent compared to previous years. 

The continuous collaboration between clusters and UNICEF programme sections at central and field office level continued to be an important asset for emergency planning and preparedness. The collaboration ensures coherent inputs which enable UNICEF to have timely and effective emergency responses. Under the UNICEF cluster leadership and as an approach to prioritizing inter-cluster coordination, a new approach to the Yemen Humanitarian Fund planning was introduced which focuses on an integrated response to meet needs rather than a siloed sectoral approach. The expected outcome is to better serve needs of affected population and better manage the limited funding available for Yemen. 
Despite its five-month duration, the Famine Relief Fund was instrumental in accelerating lifesaving and preventive nutrition services across the country with focus on the priority districts identified by the IPC 2020. The main challenge will be to sustain the gains beyond the grant expiry period 
 
External communication is central to UNICEF’s advocacy. UNICEF provided interviews and content to local and international media outlets. The engagement of young people in the development of the office’s advocacy products was critical to provide a venue for their participation and engagement. This was reflected during the development of the World Children’s Day song “The Dream of Reem” which was based on a focus group discussion with a number of young people and reached more than 500K on social media.

Restrictions on SBC-RCCE, particularly in the northern governorates, remained a major challenge. Restrictions included impounding supplies (community volunteers toolkits/ job aids, reusable face masks), obstructing some community engagement activities such as Mother-to-Mother clubs in some locations, as well as reluctance of MoPHP in the north to explicitly mention COVID in RCCE interventions. One of the lessons learned was the need to further strengthen the role of religious and community leaders in RCCE to address misconceptions derived from distorted religious beliefs that affect adoption of promoted practices or vaccination acceptance. For example, COVID-19 assessments showed that many respondents cited trust in God when they were asked about practicing COVID-19 prevention measures or willingness to take COVID-19 vaccines. The efforts of religious leaders were further reinforced with a brief guide prepared with support from the Ministry of Religious Guidance to refute COVID and COVID vaccine misconceptions from distorted religious beliefs. The guide will be disseminated for community volunteers to help them address such misconceptions when engaging with the community.

During 2021, UNICEF Yemen completed two out of four planned evaluations, being the first evaluations commissioned and completed in the last five years.  Three additional evaluations are ongoing and will be completed in 2022. All the large evaluations commissioned in 2021 made use of evaluation reference groups that included 42 staff members from external partner and donor organizations. 
 
In relation to evaluation, a key lesson learned is that, due to complexity of the operating context, including the intensification of the conflict and difficulties of access, the timelines were longer and evaluations more costly than anticipated.   In 2022, the guidance on standard cost of an evaluation has been increased from US$ 100,000 to US $200,000, and timelines will be lengthened from a 2021 standard of five months to a 2022 standard of between eight and eleven months to account for these challenges.
 

"
SAR,Afghanistan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"2021 has been a year full of unprecedented challenges – but also opportunities. Despite COVID-19, increased insecurity during June-August, the change in power has improved safety and increased access to areas that were unreachable before, and a renewed world attention to the country. This has enhanced the need for agile and flexible programme designing and delivery. 
 
UNICEF is exploring new ways of delivering services in a politically sensitive and hostile environment, benefitting from possibility to expand the CBE program, as well as engaging more directly with the public education system: schools, teachers and local structures (School Management Shuras). In addition, the current situation allowed to further explore multiple pathways (i.e., distance learning) for catch up on what they have missed during school closures and expanded access, and also looking into the operationalization of the Comprehensive Safe School Framework, geared towards building new competencies and strengthening of institutions for increased resilience.  
 
Future funding for COVID-19 vaccine could provide additional opportunity for using immunization programmes as an entry point for PHC strengthening. New priorities such as mental health, are now in public discourse as evidence shows a significant percentage of recovered COVID-19 cases suffering from depressions. New partnerships and financial resources resulting from COVID-19 will be optimized to strengthen Primary Health Care services (PHC). 
The polio programme used COVID-19 was used as an opportunity to establish contact with communities in inaccessible areas where polio campaigns are banned. By securing additional resources and re-purposing some of the existing grants 8.9 million soap bars, face masks and hand sanitizers were provided to all front-line Polio workers including ICN. Due to limitations in global supplies the programme innovatively collaborated with supply section in engaging local soap manufacturers.
 
The ability to adapt quickly to the changing environment allowed UNICEF to implement a cVDPV2 outbreak response amid COVID-19 pandemic in a safe and acceptable manner to the communities.  Building on the relationship with the Taliban, UNICEF procured and delivered new type of vaccines (mOPV2 and tOPV) to respond quickly to cVDPV2 outbreak despite challenges due to increased stock of bOPV in-country and limited cold chain capacity. 
UNICEF initiated a simplified treatment protocol in 2019 which continued during 2020 and 2021 which recommends a revised dosage for RUTF prescription. Overall analysis has been positive with performance indicators (cure, default, death and non-cure rates) including length of stay remaining same as the standard protocol.  While the process for conducting formal research is ongoing to ensure effectiveness prior to scaling up given the L3 emergency the simplified protocol will be implemented wherever possible.  
 
Engagement of all relevant stakeholders, including children, in the whole process of consultations on issues that matter to the children, families, professionals need to be more deliberately considered.  Four regional consultations were convened (Kabul, Herat, Mazar, Khost) with participation of provincial Governors, Department of Labour and Social Affairs (DoLSA), National Police, CSOs and children themselves on the several policies that have been endorsed. Marginalized children including those from orphanages, street and working children, and those in Juvenile Rehabilitation Centres (JRCs) were consulted on a National Policy to promote Child Friendly Policing. 
Investments in community level advocacy with de facto authority allowed gender and women empowerment activities to resume in various provinces post August 15. Used Appreciative enquiry (AE) tool to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the lives of young people and their communities resulting in the design of adolescent preferred life skills sessions in the girls’ safe spaces (GSS) currently operational.
The fragile context coupled with the ongoing covid-19 pandemic demand more agile data collection systems. UNICEF has reached out to key partners for the establishment of MICS plus, a mobile data collection platform that supports collection of key indicators for children typically found in a MICS survey. The office also rolled out a field monitoring system which provides a near real-time data on the programme implementation. It enabled the office to verify who was reached, where and with what interventions. Engagement with partners for solutions towards agile data collection which started in 2021 will be prioritized in 2022.
The collapse of the banking system was a major constraint to humanitarian cash transfers. UNICEF scaled up its operational capacity with the establishment of a Programme Management Unit to manage sensitive payments, including cash transfers. Successes being registered with this arrangement has led to improved support from donors.
The adaptation of cost-effective and sustainable solar-powered systems instead of diesel-powered water supply systems has helped reduce emission of greenhouse gases and were found to be highly cost-effective compared to temporary solutions such as water trucking. UNICEF successfully transitioned into provision of safely managed drinking water services as each water supply system is now tested for bacteriological contamination and, if needed, for chemical contamination upon completion before handing over to the communities.
UNICEF’ Afghanistan utilized U-Report network to engage with beneficiaries and better understand needs on the ground as they develop. Several U-Report polls were launched as part of ACO’s humanitarian response to better understand the needs of the community and deliver services accordingly. More than 115,000 responses were received within 3 days, the highest U-Report response rate in Afghanistan to date. 
Integration of COVID 19 prevention messages and COVID 19 vaccination into the RCCE package and community engagement interventions were cost-effective and efficient at the national and community levels. 
After Aug, most agencies reduced their footprint whilst UNICEF stayed and delivered, scaling up programme delivery – UNICEF therefore cannot rely on a One UN business operations framework in such circumstances and must be prepared to stand alone as a front-line agency in such situations. 
 
In light of the L3 declaration, the HR team adjusted its composition from a geographic HRBP model, to a flexible, function-based HR service, with a heavy focus on recruitments (200+ posts in 3 months, including surge, new PMU unit, one mail-poll PBR, and staffing scale-up through Temporary Appointments), and individualized and hands-on support to national staff that fled the country, as well as IP colleagues that found themselves stranded outside of Afghanistan.
"
SAR,Bangladesh,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons learned
 
COVID-19 vaccination and routine immunization efforts competed for health staff and system capacity, including cold chain storage and vaccine distribution. To overcome this, UNICEF installed additional cold-chain equipment, hired cold space and refrigerated vehicles and introduced vaccine and logistics management in DHIS2. Adopting a facility-based COVID-19 vaccination strategy enabled routine immunization to continue. UNICEF managed risks of handling procurement services for essential and life-saving commodities, particularly vaccines, with respect to in-country logistics and last-mile delivery, as high volumes of sensitive shipments arrived with great intensity. Undercapacity of Government to ensure smooth and timely receipt of vaccines, poor infrastructure, and bureaucracy will be considered in future supply chain management.
 
Multisectoral coordination was critical to deliver the COVID-19 response in Bangladesh. Putting in place WASH facilities and guidelines laid the groundwork to safely reopen schools in September. Multisectoral collaboration was also essential to plan adolescent nutrition interventions and reach adolescents with in-school nutrition services, linking with the education curriculum to enhance adolescents’ knowledge and practices on healthy diets.  
Integrated urban interventions for improved nutrition further strengthened multisectoral collaboration. A randomized controlled trial integrated nutrition-sensitive interventions, such as in WASH and social protection, with nutrition-specific interventions, accompanied by strong SBCC. A proof of concept will now be developed for integrated interventions to improve complementary feeding practices and reduce environmental enteropathy among vulnerable urban children. 
 
Integration of SBCC in multisectoral programming enabled better results for children and adolescents. Local advocacy and partnerships enlisted local leaders’ responsiveness and community action to prevent child marriage and connect referrals to services. It is necessary to scale innovative SBCC approaches such as U-Report, which reached and gathered feedback from adolescents. 
 
Monitoring results during COVID-19 and other emergencies was challenging. BNNC can enhance accountability of multisectoral nutrition efforts by establishing interoperable data and financial tracking systems for increased, equitable investments for nutrition. Monitoring of WASH in schools via existing EMIS is key and strategic, as is a framework for clearer roles and responsibilities regarding construction and operation and maintenance (O&M) of WASH in schools. Ensuring safe and sustained services also involves substantial and recurrent funding and adequate O&M systems. 
 
Real-time monitoring and reporting for the vitamin A campaign facilitated immediate follow-up and a timely supply response to achieve coverage targets.
Reaching locked-down adolescents was critical. With service uptake reduced, the health and child protection systems adopted alternative modalities to reach adolescents, like online platforms, peer education with physical distancing, a sexual and reproductive health and rights digital platform, and RCCE. Conducting activities online raised challenges, however, including how to reach target audiences in remote locations lacking continuous internet connectivity or the many adolescents without mobile phones. Inclusion of adolescents with disabilities has been particularly difficult during the pandemic. 
 
The prolonged COVID-19 crisis has further emphasized the importance of a systemic and adaptive social protection mechanism for children. More evidence on promising practices in social protection must be generated for aggressive advocacy for policy reforms, combining efforts with other development partners. 
 
The pandemic has demonstrated how flexible resources are essential to ensure that UNICEF can provide communities with long-term support to build resilience and also respond quickly and effectively to sudden emergencies. Programmatic follow-up and reporting were strengthened across the country office to ensure activities were implemented as planned or reprogrammed to meet COVID-19 restrictions and population needs.  
 
Innovations
 
DHIS2 surveillance for COVID-19 was a breakthrough innovation for Bangladesh. Comprising notification of positive cases by text message, follow-up phone call, and outcome tracking, the system became an example for other countries. 
 
A maternal and newborn health and routine immunization e-tracker in DHIS2 was developed and piloted. Capacity development took place to improve reporting rates, data quality, and use of data through upgraded national health data dashboards.
 
The oxygen crisis during the pandemic’s second wave was a critical challenge for MOHFW. UNICEF supported a situation analysis of the country’s oxygen ecosystem and MOHFW endorsed the resulting National Oxygen Landscape Report. It provides deep analysis of system gaps and illustrates a strategic pathway for MOHFW to ensure an effective oxygen security system. Additionally, a liquid medical oxygen system, with oxygen lines and staff training in 30 facilities, was established to support hypoxaemic COVID-19 patients. 
 
Insufficient human resources posed challenges elsewhere in health facilities, with medical personnel still overburdened by demands of treating COVID-19. To improve service quality, 16 medical officers were recruited to mentor, monitor and orient staff on MNCAH services, IPC and COVID-19 case management. Timely distribution of UNICEF-supported oxygen equipment was hindered by port clearance processes. This was resolved through advocacy by UNICEF for DGHS and MOHFW to support budget allocation for customs duties and Value Added Tax. 
 
Lessons learned during the pandemic have paved the way to reimagine how education is delivered, including for children who struggle to access learning even in normal times. UNICEF-supported remote learning modalities ensured learning continuity for most children despite school closures. UNICEF is partnering with the Government to establish a blended education strategy to improve coverage and effectiveness of remote learning through low-tech modalities. In support, the Ministry of Primary and Mass Education plans to install Wi-Fi connectivity in all 65,000 schools. 
 
UNICEF continued its efforts to diversify the ALP, adding online and blended modalities to connect out-of-school adolescents and young people with wage employment, self-employment and entrepreneurship. A pilot of the informal apprenticeship, digital skills training and entrepreneurship training modalities commenced among 3,100 out-of-school young people.
 
Technological innovations saw the nationwide measles-rubella campaign reach 36 million children. Weekly communication by mobile phone was introduced for HIV-positive pregnant women amid COVID-19 restrictions on movement.
 
The transformation to virtual court proceedings and enhanced coordination among Children’s Courts, detention centres, police and probation officers marked a new era for children in contact with the law. Virtual courts have been enacted in law, so children will continue to benefit from swifter trials and exemption from the courtroom, as well as the growing preference for non-custodial measures.  

"
SAR,Bhutan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
GA1: EVERY CHILD SURVIVES AND THRIVES
 
Lessons learned: Development of the SOP on continuity of essential nutrition services during the pandemic proved essential for coordinated efforts and to ensure scaling up to high levels of coverage (>90 percent) of Micronutrient Powder (MNP) supplementation together with IYCF counselling. The use of digital platforms also proved to be an efficient and effective way of ensuring capacity development of health providers to scale up MNP supplementation across all 20 districts. Communication interventions to promote COVID-19 vaccines and provision of personal protective equipment for vaccinators also contributed to high coverage of COVID-19 vaccination in Bhutan.  
 
Innovation: The use of social media in collecting data, sharing feedback, and mobilizing community influencers through virtual sessions could be scaled up in future social and behaviour change interventions. Government agencies, local leaders, religious leaders, youth volunteers, CSOs and local media learnt how to work together effectively for the same goal to ensure continuity of services.
 
GA2: EVERY CHILD LEARNS
 
Lessons learned: The importance of emergency preparedness planning in the context of education to ensure learning continuity remained critical. The move to digital platforms for learning provided teachers with ample opportunities to hone their ICT skills in teaching and learning. The 21st Century Education Road Map is an upstream opportunity for UNICEF to influence education reforms that address the emerging needs of all children and young people. The introduction of New Normal Curriculum presents an opportunity for UNICEF to improve the quality of education from a largely-content driven to child-centered pedagogy-driven approach. 
 
A key lesson learned through piloting of the CFC package was the acknowledgement that caregivers need psychosocial support. In addition, by providing this support, parenting can be strengthened for the benefit of children’s holistic development as well as the wellbeing of caregivers themselves. This could evolve into an important community-based approach to mental health promotion and response. However, informal feedback from the ECCD facilitators, suggest that they need more training on providing essential counselling support since many caregivers face difficult situations and areas where they need support, which often extend beyond the support ECCD facilitators can provide. 
Innovation: ECCD centre closures in 2020 opened the gateway for remote learning support and home-based interventions. As a result, UNICEF and MoE initiated the exploration of introducing a home-based intervention package to improve early learning and stimulation for children from vulnerable backgrounds and extremely remote locations in five pilot districts.
 
GA3: EVERY CHILD IS PROTECTED FROM VIOLENCE AND EXPLOITATION
 
Lesson learned: With the mental health of young people greatly affected by the pandemic, UNICEF advocated at the highest level with Government partners, Parliamentarians, and Her Majesty the Queen, and worked with Youth Development Fund, young people, MoE, MoH, and UNDP to analyze and address the issue through a whole-of-society, whole-of-government, whole-of-lifecycle approach. These concerted efforts and holistic approach proved instrumental in stimulating dialogues and actions required to address mental health including gender-based violence.
 
Innovations: Continuing with the innovative ideas used in 2020, further enhancement of Bhutan’s social service workforce capacity, especially for those in high-risk zones, was carried out through online platforms such as telephone, zoom, skype, WhatsApp, WeChat and Messenger, thereby ensuring wider reach while saving time and costs. 
 
To ensure that maximum voices of children are captured in the Children’s Report to the Committee on the Rights of the Child, an online survey-based questionnaire was used to gather their feedback. Where permissible, focus group discussions with children were also carried out.
 
UNICEF’s support in the development of Bhutan’s first Volunteer Management Information System, a database of youth volunteers and organizations, has helped in consolidating youth-related and youth-led programmes and services in the country.
 
GA4: EVERY CHILD LIVES IN A SAFE AND CLEAN ENVIRONMENT
 
Lesson learned: Although UNICEF’s focus on upstream interventions in WASH had resulted in the Government taking over most of the construction and maintenance of water supply schemes, handwashing facilities and toilets, there has been decreased domestic budget allocation this year across all sectors, including the WASH sector due to diversion of national budget towards the COVID-19 pandemic response. This raises concerns about the sustainability of WASH services. 
 
Innovations: A case study for inclusive WASH in schools and monastic institutions was conducted through virtual platforms and social/mass media platforms with UNICEF support, optimizing resources and proving to be a cost-effective alternative to address limited funding exacerbated by the current pandemic. The study provided evidence to increase investment and sustain the provision of an inclusive and comprehensive WASH package in all schools, monasteries, and nunneries as part of the national WASH development goals as well as SDGs 4 and 6. The investment case report will soon be finalized and a policy brief developed for advocacy at the highest levels – both will also be adopted and used for advocacy with WASH stakeholders.
 
GA5: EVERY CHILD HAS AN EQUITABLE CHANCE IN LIFE
 
Lesson learned: Social policy in general and social protection remain relatively new fields in Bhutan. The current pandemic crisis highlighted the need for UNICEF to continue high-level advocacy with the Government and key stakeholders on the importance of child-focused social protection measures, programming with young people around youth engagement at the local government level to integrate some of the elements of the Child-friendly Local Governance (CFLG).
 
Furthermore, COVID-19 has negatively affected the social sectors as the priorities of the Government shifted towards reviving economic sectors such as tourism, construction, agriculture, and manufacturing. In the face of an increasingly limited fiscal space for social sectors, UNICEF needs to further invest in improving the understanding of key government agencies, especially Ministry of Finance, GNHC, Parliament and local government authorities, to invest in child outcomes.

SAR,India,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Innovations
 
Innovative data collection and use of digital platforms: COVID-19 propelled implementers to utilize digital platforms for larger outreach and innovations in 2021. UNICEF utilized telecommunication such as telephone for assessments and for data collection, monitoring and gap analysis across most states. These remote systems for monitoring and supportive supervision helped programmes to support continuity of services. Tools like Kobo and RapidPro were used to collect responses from communities, which helped assess the pandemic's effect at a macro and micro level on a real-time basis. Applications like Safe Delivery App, HIV-AIDS App, and the digitalization of programme modules were also done. Low-tech innovation was piloted to engage parents on responsive parenting using interactive voice response (IVR) and feature phones in UP and Jharkhand. 
 
Integrating and scaling climate-resilient and urban solutions: Climate change has emerged as one of the biggest threats to human health and access to services in India. UNICEF supported programmatic and technological solutions to strengthen water source sustainability. These include hydrological mapping and water use analysis at the community level (in addition to improving the efficient use of water through Jal Jeevan Mission), improving adaptation and mitigation practices adopted by schools and health-care facilities such as installing renewable energy generators for cold chains, and greywater recycling and improving waste management practices that mitigate environmental degradation through strengthening local-level governance and planning processes under the SBM Phase II. These investments contribute to building a green economy by skilling and professionalizing the relevant workforce. These initiatives are also adapting communities to become more resilient in facing and coping with post climactic shocks in urban and rural areas. There is great potential to skill-up youth to promote climate action in their communities and peer groups.
 
Mental health: To support the emotional wellbeing of children and help them overcome exam stress, 1.1 million children (46 per cent girls) in the 14-16 year age group utilized an emotional learning programme. Students were reached through a toll-free IVR number, while teachers were reached through WhatsApp using innovative methods like 30 stories for students and ten stories for teachers. These were created and contextualized for students to better relate to the scenarios pertaining to their social and emotional wellbeing along with feedback platforms for students. This was done in collaboration with the Governments of Bihar, Jammu and Kashmir, and Jharkhand. 
 
Lessons learned
 
The reviews conducted in 2021 revealed that the strategic priorities of the 2018-2022 Country Programme remain highly relevant to achieving results for children. The following lessons were gathered in 2021: 
 
There is a need to refine strategies further and innovate to reach the most vulnerable children, and respond to the new realities presented by COVID-19, including tackling the child deprivations that have intensified in its wake. For instance, the COVID-19 emergency in 2021 has highlighted the need for UNICEF India to make greater use of adaptive and risk management approaches. The health sector’s shock responsiveness was improved by UNICEF mobilizing and engaging various communities of practice to address the primary and secondary impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
In 2021, UNICEF India successfully expanded its engagement with the private sector. It enhanced the utilization of partners’ assets in support of national priorities such as supplies, vaccine uptake and joint advocacy for COVID-19 prevention. A wide network of partnerships was also fostered with private sector platforms, networks, and aggregators committed to protecting and promoting child rights at the national and state level, allowing us to start new activities in support of family-friendly policies in the textile industry, and challenging harmful gender stereotypes in the marketing sector. The year also saw new innovative engagements, creating funding through partnering with CryptoRelief, a community-run fund delivering respite via the procurement of critical supply syringes, and raising awareness on mental health through a non-fungible token auction, and a partnership with the ICC T20 World Cup. Moving forward, there is potential to reflect on and refine UNICEF's approach to partnerships, including building on existing partnerships and stronger private sector involvement.
 
A positive lesson learnt from the pandemic response has reinforced the “regular” evidence-based data for adapting and implementing risk communications in response to the rapidly evolving environment. More than 80 million people were reached and engaged through RCCE, with half a million frontline workers, CSOs and youths trained to engage communities. The pandemic demonstrated the value of evidence generation and behavioural insights as key to positioning social and behaviour change vis-a-vis sectoral, government and non-government partners. There is potential to expand community feedback and accountability mechanisms to affected populations to strengthen engagement with communities. The evidence strategy developed covering essential data, research, and evaluation of critical knowledge gaps, identifying policy solutions and strengthening UNICEF’s value-add as the thought-leader on children in India. 
 
UNICEF was well-positioned to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in India in 2021 basing on its strong expertise in disaster preparedness and response to children, and its ability to convene and rapidly mobilize partners to respond to the evolving situation on the ground. The office mobilized almost US$96 million to respond to the priority concerns affecting children as a fallout of the pandemic. Learnings from 2021 highlighted the importance of coordination, including timely data and streamlined processes for effective management. There is also a need for strengthened capacity of UNICEF technical staff on risk-informed programming and emergency response.
"
SAR,Maldives,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The power of convening and partnerships:  UNICEF worked well with a diverse range of partners proactively and strategically to mobilize around thematic areas of common interest.  This once again highlighted the importance of partnerships in prevention and response efforts at scale.   Some examples where this worked out well include the multiple stakeholder engagement around the National Campaign on Prevention of Sexual Abuse, a sensitive and important issue discussed at this scale for the first time.    

The COVID response efforts is another example notably how the urgency of addressing mental health prompted government, UNICEF, CSOs and UN agencies, notably WHO, to work in tandem to address gaps and boost awareness at community level. 
 
 Building back better:  There were several opportunities to use online platforms to improve access to services or coordination efforts in a context affected by COVID. This is particularly noteworthy in the context of Maldives as an island nation where such platforms can make a difference to bridge geographical challenges for remote islands or during periods of lockdowns, or when access to services for children and their families is challenged by severe weather or storms. These platforms are also useful for advocacy and capacity-building services for improvement of quality of services. Examples of such initiatives are:  
 

Support to Maldives Police Service to establish virtual classrooms for training to strengthen the capacity of officers dealing with child protection issues across the country. 
A ‘one stop shop’ website is under development incorporating all relevant information for survivors of violence, as part of the National Campaign on Prevention of Sexual Abuse. 
A club entitled ‘Rakkaatheri Mujthamau’ (translates as Safe Community Club), was created on Clubhouse with all IBAMA stakeholders as administrators, to share information regarding child and social protection with the public. 
Clubhouses were also used to raise awareness on COVID prevention, addressing vaccine hesitancy and promoting nutrition and positive feeding practices for children during lockdowns. 
Use of innovative technology was critical for continuity of learning. Although online learning through Google Classroom provided almost 54 per cent of the teachers in government schools with online teaching/learning pedagogies and assessment skills, it is equally important to pay attention to the quality of online learning. As such, more open-source digital tools and resources should be made available to teachers to ensure ethical use of copyrighted digital materials. More engagement with the private sector, notably mobile network companies, would go a long way to improving not only online access and affordability but also online safety initiatives. 
UNICEF supported development of a digital portal (FILAA portal) with user-friendly features consisting of teaching learning resources developed by schools for all grades and subjects. The portal provides online resources for teachers to share materials with teachers across the country and for students to access learning and reference materials. A student can access the recording of a missed online class or a presentation catch-up at his/her own pace. With Women in Tech NGO, a series of engaging and fun audio-visual materials were created to address online safety for children and parents. 
 
Engagement with Adolescent girls and boys: In 2021, with most of the population vaccinated and some in-person meetings and physical convening becoming possible, UNICEF used a few opportunities to engage young people as advocates and informants for programmes and policies that are important to their present and future, notably climate action and the employability agenda. Recent data and analysis available in 2021, such as a U-Report study with young people on climate and others around education and climate fed into the design of interventions.  Two concrete opportunities were presented and seized: 

The pre-COP26 buzz event as mentioned above was one such opportunity. UNICEF also supported participation of young people at COY (Conference of Youth) and COP26 and worked with young people to create messages and videos for broadcasting on different local and global platforms, including on the occasion of Children and Youth Forum 2021. This is the beginning of establishing a platform for ongoing dialogue and exchange on climate action. A programme to this effect will be rolled out in 2022. 
Adolescent girls and boys were also consulted as co-creators on the new skills programme, UPSHIFT. Based on insights received from adolescents, a measure was taken to include three young interns in the country office UPSHIFT team to plan and implement UPSHIFT in such a way that it is inspiring to other young people. "
SAR,Nepal,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"During the fourth year of the Country Programme, we generated significant  new evidence and related learning about the situation of child rights in Nepal and applied these to strategic advocacy for high-level decision-making and allocation of resources. This was complemented by operational innovations to ensure the three levels of government are supported with adequate technical assistance and partners to fulfil their roles and responsibilities.

Learning and Evidence
The UNICEF Nepal Child and Family Tracker (CFT) remained an important source of timely data on the status of children and families in terms of the secondary impact of COVID-19. UNICEF Nepal applied data findings and learning to all our interventions and anticipates to incorporate real time learning in the next Country Programme to be developed in 2022. The CFT effort is complemented by additional, new streams of data, started due to the severity of the COVID-19 impact and the urgency to track the situation of children. This includes scale-up of the Protection Monitoring and Incident Reporting (PMIR) system with input from multiple partners. These data have been a major lever in stimulating federal and local action and investment in support of the most marginalized children. Further support to the police and justice sector in consolidating and analyzing data on gender-based violence and suicide has led to enhanced recognition of children’s and adolescent mental health needs and the impact of sexual abuse of children among policy makers and service providers. 

Other digital tools were brought into place including, a real-time monitoring tool (ONA) to monitor and visualize mask use in public spaces throughout the country; U-Report/RapidPro as a platform to engage volunteers with 2-way communication, to allow stimulation, recognition, motivation of those whom we ask to contribute their time, and a collaboration with local radio journalists to collect real time perceptions and voices of communities in most hard-to-reach areas. Consistently, these engagements, enrich UNICEF, policymakers and partners alike with concrete community feedback and evidence on needs and priorities. In the case of the local radio journalists, a new Nepali format of community open-mike radio programme emerged, amplifying the voices of disadvantaged communities, women, persons with disability and others at a local and wider scale.

Strategic Influencing
UNICEF Nepal is employing new data and evidence as a powerful tool in  strategic influencing. The CFT, for example, was used at multiple levels from sector-specific reviews to orientation of media to briefings with senior government and development partners. The evidence generated on the long-term economic impact of COVID-19 is one piece believed to contribute to the late, but important decision to allocate funds for cash support to the 500,00 most deprived households in Nepal. This was further emphasized with operational efforts of post-distribution monitoring of UNICEF's own “Cash PLUS” (cash plus additional low-cost sectoral interventions to maximize impact) as well as the need-based analysis effort to target the most deprived by key indicators of vulnerability.

One of the exciting areas of scale was the adoption by local, and provincial authorities of the UNICEF sponsored initiative for local WASH plans. A digital planning tool, NWASH, helps local government plan and cost needs and set priorities. Initially supported in seven municipalities, UNICEF estimates a further US$ 300,000 was contributed from government to scale the programme to a total of 102 municipalities in Lumbini province. An acknowledged confidence as well as potential path to replicate with wider integration of Child-friendly Local Governance to sub-national planning efforts. 

Noting the low coverage of current management of acute malnutrition programme, UNICEF Nepal anticipates 2021, with the newly approved Family MUAC and simplified approaches for treatment of child wasting, may be the break-through moment for an innovation suitable to improve early detection of child wasting and increasing treatment coverage. Driven by the dire COVID-19 situation, the MOHP-agreed pilot in four districts will bring robust evidence and a recommended path to better address this long-standing challenge in Nepal.  

Operational Innovations
At operational level, UNICEF Nepal continued to learn and expand its approaches to providing technical assistance to service solutions to 753 municipal and seven provincial governments to close critical capacity and service gaps. One of UNICEF’s largest partnerships, with the Nepal Red Cross Society, resulted in massive benefits for children across multiple sectors  organized as a single agreement to bring greater coherence, impact, cost-efficiency. The partnership brought significant on the ground capacity to complement local government efforts. In bringing skills and capacities together at local level, several lessons and innovations stand-out:
    

community-based volunteer networks with women and youth organizations have strengthened early identification and response capacity within the PMIR system.
partnerships with the Simulation Society Nepal (SSN) and BEFON to strengthen the training quality of maternal and neonatal health care services and fill gaps in maintenance and repair of biomedical equipment;
a commercial agreement for HR services ensured a steady, rapid, quality, dedicated human resource pool to technically assist line ministries for the implementation of the Multi-sectoral Nutrition Programme (MSNP) and rapidly scale up from 308 to 720 municipalities by filling capacity gaps in nutrition sensitive and specific planning, budgeting, and reporting. 

UNICEF Nepal contributed to an innovative flood anticipatory action program to deliver multi-sectoral, humanitarian assistance to at-risk populations before the predicted flood occurs based on the early warning system. Using a geographically defined readiness trigger, UNICEF and partners pre-identified potential flood impact households for the eventual response in case the disaster hits. While this uncovered important lessons about the suitability of triggers before a crisis, it flagged the ability of local partners to map out vulnerabilities and shorten the timeframe between crisis and support received. 

UNICEF and partners gained important insights for alternative learning modalities. Noting that television, internet connectivity, and/or computers remain largely inaccessible to the vast majority of children in Nepal, given the low affordability of these technologies, particularly in poorer communities, UNICEF innovated solutions using SMS/phone-based solutions to support teachers and families. While far more humble compared to other global digital innovations, for Nepal targeting the most hard to reach communities with remote, tele-teaching solutions is an important innovation.  

"
SAR,Pakistan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"To reach scale, innovations in continuity of learning require acknowledging the digital divide and developing cohesive frameworks that encompass different learning modalities 

In 2021, UNICEF took forward support for remote learning including the Digital Learning for Every Child programme in Sindh Learning Passport and a new partnership with ITU on the GIGA initiative to map school connectivity. However, the number of children reached by such initiatives remains limited by inadequate access to digital devices, low digital literacy and motivation. In particular, an equitable approach to continuity of learning requires not relying on digital means alone, but developing a cohesive framework encompassing different modalities, considering the enabling environment required and their impacts on learning. While innovations in digital learning should continue, innovations in no-tech and low-tech modalities are essential to reach the most marginalized children.

Thus, while COVID-19 accelerated digital service delivery, as a UNICEF study of learning losses revealed, the digital divide is substantial and risks leaving behind vulnerable households. As UNICEF takes its adolescent development programme forward, it will strengthen partnerships that help close this divide by investing in adolescents’ access to digital communication modes.

Opportunities have emerged for systems strengthening and humanitarian-development linkages 

The shock of the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the weaknesses of existing systems to deliver essential services and opened a crucial window of opportunity for strengthening systems and humanitarian-development linkages. Thus, for example, cold-chain and human-resource strengthening for immunization sustained COVID-19 vaccination drives. While COVID-linked needs for psychosocial support were met by introducing MHPSS in Sindh and Punjab through public-private partnerships, drawing on a UNICEF-supported model embedded into KP health services.

Reframing health system development discourse and re-aligning it with Pakistan’s UHC aspirations and COVID-19 response achieved greater buy-in from government and sector actors. To capitalize on this, and to sustain momentum, UNICEF support for developing district Essential Packages of Health Services, the UHC investment case and primary health care through health system strengthening, enabled the government to prioritize health system reforms for efficient and equitable service delivery.

A “back to basics” strategy, to improve the foundations rather than introduce innovating, was crucial for progress in polio eradication 

In 2021 UNICEF leveraged recent management changes to address operational issues in polio supplementary immunization planning, implementation, evaluation and review. This “back to basics” strategy prioritized the execution of basic components as a foundation for subsequent activities and contributed to optimal campaign quality.

Thus, pre-campaign preparedness schedules were followed meticulously, with informed local-level decisions based on readiness. Missed children were recorded using existing data tools and district teams designed and implemented targeted recovery interventions. Post-campaign reviews in all union councils, districts, provinces and nationally, informed planning for subsequent rounds. 

UNICEF tailored strategies to specific contexts, with appropriate frontline workers, supportive supervision, microplanning, specific training for vaccinators and systematic monitoring. These were accompanied by support for integrating community-based vaccination into the health system, access to integrated basic services for historically marginalized communities, and systems strengthening for vaccine stockpile management. These contributed to the successful campaigns that underpinned the decline in polio cases and environmental samples.

Demand-generation is most effective when linked to timely, high-quality service delivery

Following a successful pilot in 2020, the 24/7 birth-dose initiative to immunize newborns and connect them to vaccination centres was scaled up dramatically, leading to 95 per cent of newborns vaccinated from a baseline of 8 per cent before the intervention. Similarly, vaccination uptake was increased when offered as part of integrated service delivery in 40 polio super-high-risk union councils with referral slips used to link children directly to essential services, showing the value of convergence in service delivery. Thus, demand can be driven by making the right services available in the right places, as integrated packages, and in combination with multi-modal behaviour change communication.

Looking ahead

COVID-19 drew the attention of policymakers towards the need for systems strengthening. UNICEF will leverage this attention to engage with local and national policymakers, youth and CSOs to advocate for and technically support systems strengthening in sectors related to children, prioritize humanitarian-development linkages and support shock-resistant institutions for service continuity. 

With persisting economic and regional instability, pandemic conditions, and Pakistan’s vulnerability to natural disasters, UNICEF will renew support for institutions to become shock-resistant, adaptive and innovative, ensure resilience and continuity of services, and engage in risk-informed programming.

C4D was a successful strategy, particularly when paired with swift, responsive service delivery. Our technical support for evidence-based programming contributed to increasing government ownership and funding for basic and social services, research, surveys and evaluation. This will be driven forward in 2022. 

The success of private sector partnerships in 2021, as an important part of strengthening resilience and responding to COVID-19, will lead to continued focus on business for results. 
UNICEF’s support for supply, procurement and logistics was the foundation of Pakistan’s successful tetanus and measles-rubella introductions, and the substantial progress towards polio eradication seen this year. 

In the face of Pakistan’s severe gender inequalities, UNICEF will drive forward gender-transformative programming and has identified gender-responsive and transformative priorities for all programmes. 

With Pakistan’s large youthful population, increasing urbanization and multiple deprivations, UNICEF will double its efforts to incorporate the lifecycle approach in programming, and in advocacy with government. This includes building on foundational work developing structures for holistic ECD, climate-resilient programming, and supporting adolescent empowerment through quality education, skills and closing the digital divide.
"
SAR,"ROSA, Nepal",Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The unprecedented pandemic dictated how UNICEF organized itself to respond, including establishing innovative approaches and learning lessons as the situation evolved. UNICEF continued its leadership in efficient and effective technical assistance to Country Offices to develop COVID-19 responses and preparedness plans. UNICEF provided capacity development on remote collaboration tools to ensure the Regional Office and Country Offices continue operating especially during the devasting second wave particularly in Nepal and India. While the pandemic introduced a new normal with hybrid or blended working arrangements, the culture of working under these new conditions is still evolving. Willingness to embrace new solutions to collaborate in these circumstances has increased. UNICEF leveraged support by organizing awareness sessions for staff on the use of tools and applications, such as business process automation. 
The pandemic highlighted the importance of hand hygiene and WASH in schools, healthcare facilities and public spaces. Lessons learned in the context of school reopening presented an opportunity to increase investment for WASH in schools and ensure services are sustainable. Lessons learned on safely managed sanitation services and urban sanitation indicate the need to further adopt market influencing strategies to strengthen private sector engagement in sanitation. The documentation of best practices and innovation in climate-resilient WASH was critical to clearer messaging for fundraising purposes and to share best practice. 
The pandemic highlighted the importance of social protection and its role in building back better. Very key is the importance of both monetary and multidimensional poverty and its mainstreaming across sectors as a key driver to children’s wellbeing. In terms of Social Policy, UNICEF built partnerships to continue monitoring poverty and bringing to the fore of the regional and national agenda to ensure the economic recovery goes hand in hand with the social recovery for children.
Complex emergencies require greater input from UNICEF and the documentation of lessons learned from complex emergencies strengthened programming support and response. Regionally, UNICEF led the production and dissemination of public goods and other knowledge products. The humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan highlighted the need for streamlined and strengthened child protection surge capacity to ensure speedy deployment of human resources. A key lesson learned is the critical role of technical support to strategy development for programming at scale in a complex humanitarian situation. 
Momentum generated through regional processes and events benefit from dedicated resources at country level to cascade learning and translate commitments into sustainable at-scale actions at country level. Lack of recent representative population-based survey data hampers efforts for a complete understanding of the pandemic’s impacts on nutrition and for evaluating adequacy and effectiveness of public policy responses.
While governments implemented various remote learning initiatives in South Asia, more is needed to ensure marginalized children can continue learning during school closure. More so, addressing the huge scale of learning loss and widening disparities requires greater investment in building teacher capacity, assessing learning and learning recovery to avert further learning loss once children return to school. Inadequate real time data for example on school reopening, attendance, learning levels, etc., has hampered the ability to understand realities on the ground in a rapidly evolving situation. 
Extreme surges of COVID-19 cases and the Afghanistan crisis underpinned the importance of emergency preparedness. Despite substantial investment already made, more needs to be done to support Country Offices further enhance their preparedness to respond during onsets of emergencies in a timely and effective manner. UNICEF continued to identify Country Office surge capacities and expand the regional surge roster. It also continued to preposition emergency supplies and LTAs, establish contingency programme documents and assess the feasibility of humanitarian cash transfer. Joint preparedness planning and review of preparedness/contingency plans with cross-sectoral participations was further strengthened at both Regional Office and Country Office levels.
UNICEF South Asia is increasingly recognizing that content is the new currency, particularly in an increasingly digitally connected region. It invested heavily in boosting its digital team. Adopting a less risk-adverse, more genuine, human, and relatable face on social media has the potential to yield great returns and build stronger connections with the UNICEF brand, particularly among young people. The strategic leveraging of social listening insights to produce responsive digital content to respond to the needs of digital audiences especially with respect to the pandemic was a key approach that yielded results.  
Given the urgent need to build the capacity of government and CSO partner investigation capacity, UNICEF established PSEA investigation LTAs during 2021. These are new to UNICEF and are made available to all UNICEF offices and UN agencies. 
COVID-19 presented a significant risk to the health and wellbeing of staff. UNICEF personnel required to travel or work closely with communities to assist them in their COVID responses faced increased risks of exposure compared to full remote work modalities. These risks were mitigated through evidence-driven understanding of infection risks and prevention. Enhanced cooperation and communication between Headquarters, Regional Office and Country Office security teams during the crisis in Afghanistan helped ensure greater situational awareness, enabling the security team to be better prepared, anticipate evolving challenges or issues, respond rapidly and inform security decision-making.
Innovations 
An innovative solution to dissemination of data was the redesigned UNICEF South Asia Data Pocketbook. This allows data presentation and visualization driven by the supplied data without in-built limitations on the number of administrative areas and indicators that can be handled. Another, innovation in the region involved working closely with Country Offices as peer support for the mAsset Application and Property Survey Board (PSB) workflow tool to facilitate automation of asset management and reporting in VISION. The Regional Office also supported Afghanistan and Bhutan Country Offices in rolling out mAsset application.
The development of the All Children Learning Assessment Platform (ACLAP) substantially strengthened national capacities to measure learning and use assessments to improve learning. And it offered a range of dynamic assessment tools, including rapid self-analysis evaluation, online data visualization and mapping tools, plus resources to build teacher capacities.
"
SAR,Sri Lanka,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF needs to be agile and innovative in how it pursues advocacy priorities. Advocacy for the establishment of a Universal Child Benefit (UCB) is a core UNICEF priority and the Sri Lanka Country Office has been consistently advocating for a universal approach since 2019. UNICEF developed a UCB Investment Case and invested time, resources and energy advocating with government partners for a progressive realization of this goal. While partners were positive about the merits of supporting all children, there was no indication that the Government of Sri Lanka planned to take this approach forward. UNICEF perceived that a combination of limited fiscal space and the political complexity of adjusting the existing system were acting as bottlenecks. Undeterred, the Country Office decided to change focus and advocate for expanding an existing universal programme rather than establishing a new universal programme. The rationale was to make it more feasible and to reaffirm the merits of universality. UNICEF proposed the expansion of an existing voucher programme for all pregnant and lactating women, from 10 to 30 months of support, i.e., from early pregnancy until the second birthday of a child. The rationale for changing the ask was to make it more appealing and seen as a quick and low-hanging fruit gain. UNICEF developed a short, costed concept note with a strong rationale based on solid evidence, complemented by a clear budget allocation request, and presented the proposal directly to the Minister of Finance. UNICEF also engaged the Ministry of Health in helping generate demand from within the Government for this expansion. Being able to adapt and innovate paid off and the Minister of Finance, in his 2022 Budget Speech, specifically allocated funds to expand the voucher programme to 24 months and referenced the criticality of the early years for a child’s cognitive development. This is a critical step towards ensuring that all children have the right start in life – a conc
rete step towards a UCB. The Country Office will build on this progress to continue advocacy around a UCB and will remain agile in future advocacy approaches.
 
A lifecycle result framework facilitates synergies but is challenging to operationalise. The Sri Lanka Country Office adopted a lifecycle approach for the 2018-2022 country programme with results focused on early childhood, middle childhood, adolescents and social policy. As children’s needs cannot easily be divided up sectorially this approach has many merits and, theoretically, should foster better internal coordination and collaboration across teams. However, the Country Office found this approach extremely challenging to operationalise. Firstly, UNICEF’s key partners in government remain sectorially focussed, and so UNICEF’s external interactions remained sectoral. Secondly, UNICEF’s programme design and guidance at global level are structured by sector (health, education, protection) thereby requiring the Country Office to constantly adapt lifecycle discussions, thinking and priorities to ‘fit’ UNICEF’s global sectoral approaches. Thirdly, the lifecycle approach requires clear, practical accountabilities within an office and across teams so it is evident when staff are expected to function as lifecycle outcome groups or when work is better situated to sectoral teams, as both are required. These complexities consumed significant staff time to resolve, thereby outweighing any benefits generated by the lifecycle structure. The evaluation of the country programme reached similar conclusions and the Country Office will return to a sectoral approach in its next country programme. 
 
Staff wellbeing can be facilitated when staff are empowered and enabled to identify solutions. The Regional Office for South Asia (ROSA) Academy in Sri Lanka – a staff learning platform established during the pandemic - contributed to staff feeling connected and supported their learning during the pandemic. The ROSA Academy in Sri Lanka commenced with the delivery of an initial set of sessions, exploring issues relevant to staff, by an external consultant and a voluntary team of Country Office co-facilitators. Recognizing the importance of staff connectedness, the ROSA Academy in Sri Lanka launched the Kopi Kade (or Plain Tea Café) in 2021, for colleagues to come together virtually in an informal setting to talk about anything except work. During these sessions, colleagues share challenges, insights, ideas and methods to help prevent burnout and promote mental well-being. The Café is frequently visited by senior management and the involvement of the Staff Association, Young UNICEF members and Peer Support Volunteers have both refreshed the Café and strengthened the support it offers all staff. The ROSA Academy in Sri Lanka remains fully functional, and the Country Office intends to safeguard the space for staff to shape and orient it, so it remains a useful platform to support staff wellbeing and mental health.
 
Innovative thinking is required in the way UNICEF reaches the most vulnerable communities during a pandemic. UNICEF had to think more creatively in the way it accesses communities in hard-to-reach areas during a period of country lockdowns, curfew and restrictions, to ensure that critical services do not get disrupted and important gains are not lost. This was particularly important in the heath and nutrition sector given increasing food costs and insecurity. Investments in developing an electronic manual on the national protocol on the management of SAM and MAM for healthcare workers, and its dissemination through WhatsApp groups and the Family Health Bureau website, helped scale up the response, resulting in the accurate diagnosis and management of more than 150,000 children throughout the country. The improved capacity of healthcare workers to use such online platforms also enabled the dissemination of other guidelines, such as on the delivery of Reproductive Maternal New-born Child and Adolescent Health services during the COVID-19 crisis. Other innovative tools were also used to reach parents, such as the ParentText initiative by UNICEF and the Health Promotion Bureau, which provided critical health and nutrition information and the betterparenting.lk website that disseminated information on parenting in the middle of a global pandemic.

WCAR,Benin,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Innovations
La riposte COVID-19 a été une opportunité pour l’UNICEF de se positionner comme acteur clé de l’innovation au Bénin à travers plusieurs initiatives. Très souvent marginalisée des réponses aux urgences, la jeunesse a joué un rôle essentiel dans la mise en œuvre du plan de réponse national. Grace à une collaboration avec l’Université d’Abomey-Calavi, des étudiants ont créé un dispositif de lavage des mains multi-robinets, fonctionnant sans contact et grâce à des énergies propres, à destination des écoles et centres de santé. Après lancement de la plateforme U-Report, une innovation dans l’engagement des jeunes au Bénin, 250 U-Reporters ont sensibilisé et informé plus de 140,000 ménages sur les gestes barrières et les conséquences de la COVID-19 sur les enfants au niveau national. 
 
La participation des enfants et des jeunes a été placée au cœur de la programmation de l’UNICEF par la mise en œuvre du projet UPSHIFT, qui a vu 16 innovations crées par et pour les adolescents autour de la santé sexuelle et reproductive. Le programme « Acteurs de Changement 229 », initié en prélude au déploiement de YOMA, a également permis à plus de 4,500 jeunes de participer et à 700, de proposer des solutions pour faire face au changement climatique, aux VBG, à l’employabilité des jeunes et à la fracture numérique.
 
Dans la perspective d’initier des mécanismes innovants de plaidoyer pour porter la voix des enfants et des jeunes auprès des décideurs, un relais de plaidoyer a parcouru les 12 départements. Ce relais a permis aux enfants et aux jeunes de partager leurs préoccupations avec les 12 Préfets et la Vice-Présidente de la République, qui s’est engagée à garantir la participation des enfants et des jeunes aux politiques et stratégies qui les concernent.
 
Les innovations telles que VaxyRappel, qui rappelle le calendrier vaccinal aux parents par messagerie vocale, et la plateforme SIDOFFE, système d'information et de collecte de données pour le secteur social, sont des réussites sur lesquelles l’UNICEF a continué de travailler avec le Gouvernement pour son appropriation et la mise à l’échelle. Dans le domaine du WASH, l’approche marketing social de l’assainissement, a été introduite en complément de l’approche ATPC afin d’améliorer la durabilité des latrines tout en contribuant à l’employabilité des jeunes.
 
Leçons apprises
La synergie d’action entre programmes contribue à atteindre davantage de résultats. Cela a été illustré à travers le projet Cash+Care, qui rassemble des interventions de protection, santé, éducation et politique sociale pour lutter contre le mariage des enfants. La coordination des actions entre programmes, couplée à la génération d’évidence sur les gains économiques de l’éducation des filles, rendue possible grâce à une collaboration avec la Banque Mondiale, l’UNICEF et l’Ambassade des Pays-Bas, a contribué à un plaidoyer fort au niveau communautaire comme national. La sensibilisation au niveau des villages a permis de réduire le nombre de mariages d’enfants et le plaidoyer au niveau des autorités a contribué à la formulation d’un projet de loi contre les VBG et à l’organisation prochaine par le Gouvernement avec l’appui des PTFs, dont l’UNICEF, d’un Forum national sur l’éducation des filles.
 
Pour la santé de l’enfant, l’intégration des interventions de nutrition dans les localités certifiées comme ayant mis fin à la défécation à l’air libre, a contribué à une amélioration rapide du statut nutritionnel de l’enfant au niveau communautaire et à la réduction de la mortalité infantile. De même, les synergies créées entre les groupes de soutien du projet sur “l’Alimentation du nourrisson et du jeune enfant” avec les groupes de “Mutuelle de Nutrition”, financés par la Banque Mondiale, ont permis d’intégrer dans les interventions de nutrition des actions de protection sociale pour endiguer la pauvreté et les mauvaises pratiques d’hygiène, deux facteurs à la base de la malnutrition des enfants. 
 
L’intérêt des partenaires pour le travail de l’UNICEF en matière de “Finances publiques pour les enfants” a aussi démontré le potentiel de ce domaine pour mobiliser de nouvelles ressources et créer des alliances stratégiques, notamment avec le FMI. Les analyses produites avec l’appui de l’UNICEF en partenariat avec PNUD, GIZ, FMI sur le progrès des ODD, et leur financement, ont permis au Gouvernement de mobiliser 500 millions euros de ODD Eurobonds, destinés aux projets à haut impact social. En 2021, les résultats atteints par l’UNICEF avec la société civile et le Gouvernement sur la transparence budgétaire et la participation citoyenne pour une utilisation efficace des ressources publiques dans les secteurs sociaux a incité le FMI à s’associer à l’UNICEF pour élaborer une stratégie de plaidoyer budgétaire au profit des secteurs sociaux. 
 
Le rôle de l’UNICEF comme chef de file des PTFs de l’éducation reste un avantage considérable en termes de plaidoyer. La synergie d’action entre partenaires a permis de mutualiser les ressources disponibles pour atteindre un nombre d’enfants plus élevés pour la distribution des kits scolaires, réduire les coûts de scolarisation supportés par les familles, et former les acteurs principaux de l’éducation. Cependant, le taux élevé d’enfants déscolarisés reste une préoccupation majeure, accentuée par la situation sécuritaire dans le nord du pays,. 
 
Dans le domaine de la santé, le rôle joue dans le mécanisme COVAX a placé UNICEF comme acteur clé dans les efforts de vaccination et d’acheminement de biens essentiels. L’UNICEF a assuré l'acheminement de 92% des doses du Bénin.  Ce positionnement stratégique a permis de mobiliser davantage de ressources pour soutenir les efforts du Gouvernement, notamment de la part de la France et des Etats-Unis d’Amérique. 
 
Enfin, la forte mobilisation des partenaires du secteur privé et des agences de coopération internationales autour des initiatives de l’UNICEF en faveur de la jeunesse (U-Report, Acteurs de Changement 229, YOMA, etc.) a démontré la priorité qui est donnée par le Gouvernement et les PTFs à l’emploi, la participation et l’entreprenariat des jeunes. Au vu des enjeux sociaux et sécuritaires qui se profilent pour l’année 2022, l’UNICEF veillera à maintenir son positionnement en tant que partenaire stratégique pour l’engagement des jeunes, surtout comme acteurs de changement et prometteurs de paix et de cohésion sociale.

WCAR,Burkina Faso,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"CO have used the SG’s planning directive as a practical tool to improve pragmatic actions on the ground for the PADI, and it obtained positive feedback from the local authorities because, on the one hand, they praised the reinforced collaboration among the different UN agencies; and on the other hand, they appreciated being regularly involved in all the phases of the programme design, planning, implementation and follow up. Key constraints including the lack of adequate human resources in the field for some of the partner agencies, and the absence of an interlocutor with decision making power for others. In addition, the mutual recognition is not yet enough understood and implemented by all agencies. UNICEF will continue to support the field office with more joint UNCT missions to help move this joint agenda forward in 2022. 
The Rapid response and community resilience approach is an approach designed to develop innovative ways of accessing children and communities in crisis-affected regions and communes. The approach focuses on working with local authorities and existing community-based associations/platforms to improve their capacity to identify risks that particularly affect children, make communities more resilient, conduct multisectoral needs assessments in case of a crisis and recommend actions that can be supported by UNICEF and other humanitarian actors. The main strategy is to integrate community engagement in all efforts to ensure that humanitarian initiatives are more inclusive and responsive to enhance community participation and improve the quality of the humanitarian response interventions. The 3RC approach is based on a mechanism organized with the local branches of CONASUR which is the national mechanism to prevent and respond to disasters, as well as the local associations and organizations with a strong presence in hard-to-reach rural areas and with a proven ability to provide protection and assistance to the most vulnerable people. So far, more than 75,000 people were reached with a multisectoral emergency response package. UNICEF conducted vulnerability and stakeholders’ analysis in the most vulnerable communities, piloted key multisectoral partnerships linking the communities with the most suitable stakeholders, developed tools, trained partners, and prepared for the institutionalization process. Twelve multisectoral partnership with local NGOs were developed. The 3RC approach has created an opportunity for community-based associations to work effectively in locations where national and international civil society organizations are not able to reach because of insecurity. In addition, community organizations are provided with knowledge and capacities to ensure the continuity of humanitarian delivery in areas where other actors cannot reach. in 2022, UNICEF will
continue to support training of new local NGOs and associations; develop risk-informed programmes, enhancing community participation, planning, and prepared for emergency response; and support community-based organizations to provide integrated high impact interventions for crisis affected communities.        
Moreover, the partnership with local associations through the Regional directorates of water and sanitation (DREAs) is now seen as an accelerator for the ODF process in the country. Their involvement has helped better engage community leaders and local authorities in the promotion of sanitation in their villages. This partnership combined with the consultation framework established between UNICEF and MEA provided opportunities for in-depth discussions and a mutual understanding on how to accelerate sanitation coverage from a multisectoral perspective. 
UNICEF Burkina Faso initiated the application and testing of behavior sciences in nutrition and ante natal care services in 2021 to address complex development challenges. As such, the implementation Behavior Insights (BI) approach is underway as a booster in achieving results for children and pregnant women, with support from HQ and RO SBC teams. Under the umbrella of the first 1,000 days of a child’s life, the BI approach is being used within child survival programming to increase the number of pregnant women who attend antenatal care earlier, complete antennal care consultations, take multiple micronutrients supplements (MMS) tablets and follow the full antennal care package during their pregnancy period and forty-two days after childbirth. The BI intervention builds on existing community engagement strategies, community platforms, and partnerships. Although Burkina Faso is still at the trial phase, its strategic vision is to harness adequate financial and material resources as well as partnerships to scale up the BI initiative which will be fully implemented in 2022.
UNICEF accelerated the engagement with young people and adolescents through support to the organization of a Caravan led by and for youth which convened a range of key stakeholders including youth networks, national and local authorities and the private sector. Through this initiative, the CO provided innovative solutions in terms of ensuring a participatory approach and a high level of inclusion and ownership at each step of implementation. Decentralized inclusive committees were established in eight regions, led by young people including young representatives of IDPs, youth living with disabilities, out of school children, youth engaged in national and local networks, U-Reporters etc. These committees worked in close coordination with the Ministry of Youth and UNICEF and developed roadmaps and planning of activities so that young people in each locality both organized and benefited from tailor-made programs and events chosen by them (e.g., capacity building of leadership and children’s rights). This two-way approach was critical in boosting innovation, while also maximizing the engagement of young people. For example, the decentralized committees facilitated the identification of young people proactive in climate change actions and facilitated their effective participation in the regional debate ‘Youth Voices on Climate Change’ alongside more than 100 young people from the Sahel region and high-level officials and scientists. Following the conclusions of several debates dealing with the lack of access to trainings due to the Internet divide, the UNICEF team created new curricula of training via SMS on HIV and Female Genital Mutilation. Overall, the Caravan attracted more than 60,000 young people through events, debates and trainings and reached more than 4 million people via social networks, telecom and mass and community media. Thanks to the Caravan, the CO was able to demonstrate proximity and responsiveness to the concerns of youth who will be 
instrumental in the advancement of peace and development in the near future."
WCAR,Cabo Verde,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The COVID-19 pandemic has shown once again that success in combat actions can only be verified if there are joint, integrated, and well-coordinated actions. Thus, at the level of the Joint Office, the program approach and joint action, especially regarding the response to COVID19, facilitated multisectoral integration and synergies between the thematic portfolios. It is also worth mentioning the leadership assumed by government authorities in partnership with development partners, particularly SNU agencies, in implementing the health and socio-economic measures taken by the Government. In the field of health, the coordination of actions, particularly regarding the mobilization of vaccines as well as the vaccination process itself, is an example of good practices that should be extended to other areas. In the field of education, the opportunities taken by national authorities to introduce mechanisms for alternative and innovative education, with emphasis on the implementation of digital learning methods, highlight the opportunities to promote inclusion and ensure that no one is left behind, even in an adverse context characterized by the COVID-19 pandemic. Another excellent lesson learned has to do with the continued promotion of dialogue with national partners and development partners, which made it possible to overcome administrative constraints and articulate with the World Bank and Portuguese cooperation in terms of planning and avoiding duplication or overlaps in the programmatic interventions. Within the scope of the ""child protection"" program, the approach to the private sector in 2021 in the touristic islands (Boa vista, Sal, Maio e Santiago) created a positive dynamic on the Prevention of Children against Sexual Exploitation in travel and tourism context.
The multisectoral approach has favored and strengthened the articulation between national partners, reinforcing the implementation of actions in favor of children. The pandemic situation continues creating a greater institutional solidarity in terms of coordinating action on the field with the different sectors, such as governmental and non-governmental organizations."
WCAR,Central African Republic,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Le RRM a continué de représenter une excellente porte d’entrée pour avoir des réponses sectorielles rapides, efficaces et coordonnées et renforcer les synergies avec d’autres réponses de l'UNICEF, telles que, les équipes mobiles en protection de l'enfance et la réponse mobile en santé et nutrition. En 2021, 92% des interventions du RRM ont été complétées par une réponse complémentaire dans au moins un secteur, marquant de solides progrès vers une réponse multisectorielle efficace. Ayant affirmé son leadership dans la réponse en urgence multisectorielle, l’UNICEF a développé une stratégie nexus intersectorielle dont la mise en œuvre a démarré de façon modulaire dans différentes zones du pays en fonction des besoins et des capacités présentes. 
En 2021, les interventions sous forme de transferts monétaires ont été étendues avec succès, pour la nutrition et l’éducation. Cette approche s’est avérée adaptée aux besoins des foyers affectés par les conflits, permettant de réduire leurs vulnérabilités et d'améliorer leur résilience. Le bureau a désormais gagné assez d’expérience pour pouvoir la mettre à l’échelle. Les projets pilotes en cours seront documentés et serviront de levier pour le plaidoyer en faveur du renforcement de la réponse cash. Les partenaires utilisent, depuis 2021, l’outil de gestion des données HOPE, développé par l’UNICEF et piloté en première mondiale en RCA. Cet outil utilisé pour le ciblage et l’enregistrement des bénéficiaires améliore la collecte des données limitant les risques de fraude. Il inclut également un outil de gestion des plaintes améliorant la redevabilité. Son utilisation par les partenaires sera renforcée en 2022 en accompagnement de la mise à l’échelle des interventions.
L’UNICEF a renforcé sa stratégie d’intervention avancée, à travers les équipes mobiles afin de pouvoir améliorer la prise en charge des enfants et des femmes, notamment dans les communautés isolées ou déplacées dont l’accès aux prestations de services est limité. En termes de santé communautaire, le déploiement d’agents de santé communautaires mobiles, avec un stock de médicaments et un système de ravitaillement adaptés au déplacement des populations a constitué une innovation majeure. La mise en place des cliniques mobiles fournissant des paquets de services curatifs et préventifs dans les zones d’urgence a permis d’assurer la continuité des services. Dans le secteur de la protection, l’UNICEF a poursuivi les efforts de renforcement des capacités des équipes de réponse rapide de protection de l'enfance en situation d'urgence. Ces équipes composées de personnel de l'UNICEF, d'ONG partenaires et de personnel du MPFFPE sont déployées pour effectuer des évaluations et lancer une réponse d'urgence rapide lorsqu’une alerte est déclenchée, avec l’appui transversal de l’UNICEF. Les expériences engagées en santé, nutrition et protection soulignent la pertinence et l’effectivité de ces approches dans le contexte de la RCA permettant de fournir une aide vitale aux enfants en optimisant les ressources limitées. Une bonne coordination et l’appui logistique adapté sont clés pour leur mise en œuvre. 
Afin de maintenir les délais et d’assurer l’approvisionnement, le bureau a eu recours à des achats exceptionnels et optimisé les achats régionaux, en travaillant notamment avec la plateforme logistique de Douala. Alors que la crise humanitaire se poursuit et les besoins anticipés vont augmenter en 2022, le bureau pays devra analyser les possibilités et modalités de prépositionnement de fournitures chez les partenaires de mise en œuvre afin d’assurer la bonne exécution du programme tout en mitigeant le risque de vieillissement des stocks qui reste à améliorer. En complément, la collaboration avec la plateforme de Douala devrait être encore optimisée pour prépositionner des articles d'urgence. 
En termes de redevabilité envers les communautés (AAP), en 2021, l’UNICEF a mis en place plusieurs mécanismes innovants de communication, retour d’informations et traitement des plaintes des jeunes et des populations en situation humanitaire, utilisés par toute la communauté humanitaire. L’engagement communautaire a été renforcé: plateforme U-Report, installation de centres d’information, de clubs d’écoute communautaire, de kiosques de téléchargement vidéo (KTV). Dans un contexte de faible couverture internet, l’innovation des KTV assure l’information et la communication dans des zones difficiles d’accès. Les mécanismes solides de retours/plaintes ont permis d’impliquer davantage les communautés, intégrer leurs préoccupations dans la conception et la mise en œuvre de l’action humanitaire et recueillir des informations sur les facteurs comportementaux. Ainsi, à Bria ou Kaga-Bandoro les acteurs ont pu prendre des actions correctives en temps opportun dans le domaine du WASH et de la santé. Cette approche de communication bidirectionnelle avec les communautés pose les bases d’une approche du changement social et de comportement (SBC).
Dans ce contexte fragile, les approches communautaires notamment en santé/nutrition se sont avérées efficaces pour maintenir l’accès et le fonctionnement des services de base. Le niveau communautaire constitue le meilleur niveau d’intégration des interventions en termes d’impact sur les populations et particulièrement les femmes et les enfants vulnérables. La participation communautaire demeure essentielle pour l’atteinte des résultats clé. Les soins à base communautaire se sont accrus et la stratégie a mis l’accent sur une approche de paquet de soins intégrés à travers différentes plateformes communautaires. Concernant la protection, les mécanismes communautaires (RECOPE) fournissent des réponses de protection de première ligne aux enfants victimes de violence, y compris dans les situations humanitaires, permettant de poursuivre les activités même en l’absence des ONG. La constitution et la formation de ces réseaux restent une stratégie importante en vue d’apporter une réponse efficace et rapide. L’éducation a lancé une initiative à travers l’appui aux Comités de gestion pour leur participation à la campagne de retour à l’école. 
Ainsi, ces approches permettent d’assurer la continuité et la durabilité de la réponse, en contribuant à l’appropriation des activités par les communautés. La mise en place d’un modèle d’approche communautaire intégré et résilient, appuyé par le renforcement des capacités communautaires locales semble prometteur. Ceci permettrait de renforcer la résilience des communautés, en cohérence et complémentarité avec le programme d’action humanitaire, en maximisant les résultats clés pour les enfants. Cette approche sera approfondie en 2022, dans la perspective de la préparation du nouveau programme."
WCAR,Chad,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Integrated approaches key to ensuring sustainable and resilient recovery from COVID-19
 
While UNICEF continued support in 2021 in each sector, results were below expectations, because opportunities were missed to achieve sustainable recovery from COVID-19 through integrated strategies. The COVID-19 real-time evaluation findings also identified a sub-optimal use of cash transfers. Therefore, in 2022, UNICEF will deploy a multi-track strategy: integrated IPC promotion strategies involving health, WASH and education at the community level, including through locally designed IPC solutions, and cash transfers linked to SBCC for vaccination promotion.
 
Appropriate SBCC+ strategies for boosting immunization results (KRC1)
 
A twin-track approach of support to opening new vaccination centres and SBCC (with participation of communication staff and consultants, and partnerships with women’s associations) accelerated the pace of COVID-19 vaccination and reduced resistance. There were two documented weekly peaks in number of persons vaccinated, of which one saw a surge in women’s vaccination (women being one of the most resistant groups). In 2022, UNICEF will support implementation of tailored strategies focused on resistant groups and the COVID-19 national vaccination campaign in 2022 to accelerate COVID-19 vaccine coverage while maintaining routine immunization. 
 
Diversification of RUTF procurement and engagement with the private sector for timely care of malnutrition (KRC2)
 
To mitigate the impact of RUTF stock-out, the country capitalized on the availability of the Sudan-based supplier’s unused stock, ordering 15,000 cartons, which were received within one month (when previously lead times would exceed four months). This highlighted the importance of engagement with the private sector and sub-regional suppliers to facilitate production expansion and to diversify supply sources to supplement regional capacity for fast RUTF delivery to Chad.
 
Multi-sector package of interventions of health-in-school (including WASH in school) combined with support for learning quality are enablers of gender-transformative education (KRC3&KRC4) 
 
Multi-sectoral health-in-school interventions contributed to rapid scale-up, with two UNICEF-supported provinces doubling the transition rate of girls from lower to upper secondary school in less than two years. UNICEF will support the scaling up of this type of integrated approach, where supply is matched with learning support while building on community engagement to empower girls and women to ensure sustainable gender transformational results for education access and quality for girls. 
 
Appropriate political anchoring of BR initiatives to achieve rapid scale-up of BR results (KRC7)
 
Following weak results in BR in early 2021, despite support with supplies (birth registries) and technical assistance, due to competing mandates of two ministries, recognizing the critical role of appropriate institutional anchoring, UNICEF supported the preparation of a Roadmap and a circular note, jointly disseminated by the two ministries to the deconcentrated services to boost the issuance of birth certificates. This resulted in a five-fold increase in registered children compared to 2020. Strengthening ownership by all stakeholders of the interoperability approach will be a key strategy for national scale-up of BR while capitalizing on the UNICEF WCARO-supported programmatic evaluation of KRC7. 
 
Sustainable results for children require combined operational scale-up with continued advocacy (KRC8) 
 
In 2021, despite achieving cumulative results exceeding the country programme target through downsteam operations (including greater involvement with traditional and religious leaders), UNICEF missed opportunities to leverage additional investment to implement the Roadmap on ending OD, which may jeopardize sustainability. Therefore, in 2022, UNICEF will support the Government in improving its advocacy plan to mobilize more internal and external resources to implement the Roadmap while focusing on climate change resilience.
 
The power of youth in supporting an enabling environment for achieving all KRCs
 
Building on the evidence of youth promoting access to basic social services, raising awareness and conducting community and door-to-door advocacy on BR, immunization, school attendance for girls, and prenatal care in four major cities (Mao, Bokoro, Moussoro and Mongo), in 2022, UNICEF will raise awareness among institutional actors in the field so that they will work more closely with youth and involve them widely in their community outreach activities. 
 
Innovations
 
Locally produced cost-effective technologies for access to water to accelerate results in KRC8
 
To address the challenges of water scarcity in arid areas, UNICEF is exploring sand dam technology to collect and store surface water for potential scale-up in Sahel countries. A pilot sand dam was completed in 2021. While the effectiveness of this technology is being documented, it is already known to be climate-resilient and low-cost (US$0.95 per person/year in investment, with little maintenance costs), and to have a longer lifespan and lower risk of water drying up than conventional boreholes, which are not suitable for this region. 
 
Digital early warning system solutions anchored onto RapidPro/U-report to save lives 
 
The UNICEF-supported digital early warning system, linked to the U-Report platform and SMS messaging through a partnership with Tigo is operational in the two provinces, and provided early warnings of floods, population movements and epidemics, and strengthened emergency response promptness. While addressing shortcomings in the speed of response to alerts in 2021, the technology already proved its effectiveness in saving lives in response to a measles epidemic. 
 
Humanitarian access and ‘stay and deliver’ in partnership with women-led local NGOs in hard-to-reach and insecurity-affected areas  
 
In response to the withdrawal of on-the-ground presence of humanitarian actors during the April 2021 military operations, leaving populations affected by new urgent humanitarian needs without assistance, UNICEF partnered with area-based NGOs, localizing UNICEF’s emergency response and ‘stay and delivery’ strategy. In under a week, NFIs were distributed to 12,296 people, including women and children in IDP sites through an agreement with the local nursing women’s association, allowing UNICEF to ‘stay and deliver’, showing partners and donors that building new and innovative partnerships with local, women-led NGOs can save lives in complex environments.
 
Way forward using the power of youth
 
Supported by UNICEF and its partners, 500 youth participated in the 2nd National Youth Forum, focusing on youth’s role in political transition. A key theme for UNICEF in Chad in 2022 will be harnessing the power of youth, the largest constituency in Chad, as agents of change to reap the social dividends of the political transition for their communities and scale up the KRCs.
"
WCAR,Congo,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Considering the national context characterized by the health, economic and social crisis, as well as the changing programmatic environment, it appears necessary for the CO to adapt the programme to changes in the environment. 

For one, the GoC has revised its strategic planning for the next five years with the development of a new National Development Plan 2022-2026 which priority is the ddiversification of the economy. The focus on investments for new sectors of the economy has placed the social sectors not as a pillar of the NDP but as cross-cutting accelerators for development. This may have hindered the visibility of children in sectoral planning and reporting with implication for UNICEF in terms of advocacy with Government and other UN agencies to ensure that children and social services are prioritized in the collective support to the Government to reach the SDGs. 

Thus, in 2022, among other actions, operational planning with sectoral ministries will need to be strengthened to ensure that sector priorities are well translated into budgeted actions to be implemented. In addition, the current number of prioritised KRCs may be reduced to focus on high-impact ones that can benefit from adequate funding and have a ripple effect on other key interventions for children. 

However, the focus on economic diversification is an opportunity to support quality education (KRC 4) with a focus on readiness to access higher or technical education and employability. At the same time, the development of new economic free zones will imply population shifts with implications for the provision of basic social services in these areas and improved mechanisms at sub-national level to monitor the situation of children and ensure full access to all their rights, including the right to live in an environment free of all types of violence. 

Another lesson learned relates to the lack of reliable data and evidence which remains a challenge in Congo. The last major national survey, the MICS, dates from 2015 and surveys planned since 2018 such as the Population Census and the Demographic Health Survey could not be carried out due to lack of funding. Despite the efforts made by the partners, in particular UNICEF, to have data on the situation of the most vulnerable populations, the production of quality data, including administrative data, remains a challenge. 

This was highlighted by Government officials as a challenge in the elaboration of the 2022-2026 NDP and, as a result, the Ministry of Telecommunications has put forth plans to strengthen the capacity of line ministries at sub-national level to report administrative data using digital means. UNICEF partially offset this situation by generating evidence generated in health and child protection. Although this has helped strengthen UNICEF’s position as a knowledge leader with Government and partners, it is insufficient to have a holistic analysis of the situation of children and of progress towards the SDGs. 

To address this situation, it is important for UNICEF and its partners to continue to engage in high-level advocacy and capacity strengthening of the National Statistics Institute, as well as of line ministries, to promote a culture of data generation, including the promotion of innovation for real time monitoring and use of evaluations to track results and monitor the impact of programmes on the most vulnerable. To do this, the office needs to identify academic and other partners to partner with them to accompany the Government to generate the needed evidence. Also, more efforts need to be made to turn evidence into concrete action at policy and operational levels. 

In terms of UN coherence, UNICEF played a leading role in the planning and coordination of the UNDAF as lead agency for the Human Capital pillar, which comprises Health and HIV, Nutrition, Education, WASH and Social Protection, as well as for the Operations Management Team (OMT). Although coordination mechanisms with other UN agencies are fully operational, such as the UNCT, the Programme Management Team and the OMT, efforts are still needed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of coordination between the office of the Resident Coordination and UN agencies both in programmatic and operational approaches. 

The office improved financial management through increased oversight by the Country Management Team, and establishment of monthly review of indicators as well as ensuring adherence to procedures and functioning of statutory committees. The office also reinforced the capacity of staff in operating VISION. As a result, the office achieved 99.7% expenditure level, zero DCTs of over 9 months and 100% completion of spot checks and programmatic visits, an improvement and increase from the previous year.  Capacity building coupled with regular oversight of grant management will continue in 2022. As part of the Duty of Care (KRC 12), the office continued to provide an internet connection to all staff until 30 June 2021 to facilitate teleworking. These good practices will continue in 2022.

Finally, the mid-term review of the UNDAF and the UNICEF CPD in 2Q 2022 is the occasion to review if shifts are needed in the country programme although, the end-of year review with Government highlighted the relevance of a country programme founded on the life cycle approach that supports the Government to strengthen its capacity to deliver results at the the enabling environment conducive to advancing child rights (upstream level), as well as its capacity to offer universal quality services and increase demand from right holders for these services (downstream). The office, however, needs to reinforce its capacity to generate evidence and better results in demand generation and integrate RCCE in programmes in a more systemic manner. This will also be the occasion to engage with government in the establishment of a multi-sectoral coordination mechanisms in the framework of the UNDAF

"
WCAR,Cote D'Ivoire,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Innovations were mainstreamed in 2021 to accelerate progress toward key results for children and create an environment conducive to the achievement of at-scale results for children. Digital technologies were introduced in all programmes, notably: the U-Test project, through the creation of a virtual platform to facilitate young peoples’ access to information on self-testing and PrEP kits; the birth registration platform, which allows civil registers to share birth registration performance information monthly through SMS and WhatsApp displayed via a PowerBi dashboard; and the Conceptos Plasticos dashboard and live project map showing the construction status of different classrooms.  
Key result for children 1: In 2021, the CO benefited from additional resources for COVID-19 vaccination, allowing reinforcement of the expanded programme for immunization. Important lessons were learned from the initial resistance to COVID-19 vaccination: 
- Information posted on social media is volatile but not permanent. The CO reinforced communications, including: SMS messaging, regular tracking of rumours, establishing a communication monitoring committee/watchdog, and digital communication through live chats with U-Reporters and young bloggers who reinforced pro-vaccination messages. Yet it was difficult to counter misinformation. The CO therefore reinforced community engagement strategies, including collaboration with community health workers, local influencers and religious leaders. 
- When COVID vaccines and syringes became widely available, the CO supported a mobile strategy that brought vaccines closer to the population, with support from community mobilizers and U-Reporters. This strategy resulted in significant adhesion to COVID vaccination. 
- The need to monitor popular perceptions and respond flexibly. For example, low attendance was initially observed during the October national measles-rubella/Polio (MR/IPV) vaccination campaign for children 9-to-59 months. This was largely due to false rumours that the campaign aimed to attract and vaccinate children against COVID-19.  The campaign delivery strategy was therefore revamped, ensuring that every vaccination site had two clearly separated lines: one for COVID-19 vaccination for people over 18, and the other for MR/IPV vaccination for children. As a result, the MR/IPV campaign reached 95.5 per cent of its target. 
Key result for children 3: In 2021, the CO noted that children attending ‘bridging classes’ have difficulty staying motivated because many of them work and support themselves. Discussions are underway with the Ministry of Education (MoE) to identify other approaches that are better adapted to these out-of-school children without penalizing them. CO support to Islamic education structures was highly successful. By the end of the programme it will have reached about 400,000 students enrolled in these structures. Three studies produced with support from the CO provided a solid understanding of the issues, challenges and needs of all stakeholders. The main challenge was to reassure parents that their children would continue to benefit from the religious component after Islamic structures are integrated into the formal education system. The work supported by the CO around the timetable was key to accommodating both types of education. 
The CO's partnership with Conceptos Plásticos continued to generate considerable interest from donors, notably through UNICEF National Committees. However, this innovative social enterprise faced challenges in 2021 as it sought to transition from small-scale production to larger volumes. The plant experienced power cuts and struggled to meet CO demand for the production of recycled plastic bricks. In response the CO provided support, including technical assistance for the development of a business plan and production dashboard and the provision of generators for use during power cuts. In line with its management plans, the CO established a dedicated construction unit under the supervision of the Deputy Representative for Operations to ensure supervision of the quality of construction using plastic bricks.  
Key result for children 4: An assessment of the distance learning programme “Mon ecole a la maison” (My school at home) launched in 2020 revealed the limitations of learning via radio and TV broadcasts. In 2021 the MoE decided to put the programme on hold and develop a digital platform with the full content of each programme for each grade of primary and secondary education. The CO supported the MoE in this effort. While considerable progress was made, some issues should be highlighted. Putting the official curriculum online takes time. For example, 11,000 lessons need to be transformed into adapted digital resources, including a fact sheet, a video capsule and corrective self-tests. The two main recommendations are to: (i) mobilize a national team dedicated solely to producing these resources and getting them online and (ii) prioritize the content to be developed and phase-in the platform accordingly, to enable it to go online as soon as possible - even if not entirely finalized. 
Key result for children 5: Setting up a pool of ‘champion’ social workers was an innovative initiative for bringing value to frontline workers and for mobilizing social workers more broadly. The pool, consisting of designated social workers from each of the 33 regions of Côte d’Ivoire, contributes to UNICEF’s efforts to further decentralize funding and key initiatives in support of social services. 
Key result for children 7: Birth registration services are functioning well at most maternities, but birth declarations through immunization services require further support to capture children born at home and close the gap with immunization rates. Accountability mechanisms could also be developed to allow communities to report irregularities in service delivery.
In addition, the CO contributed to the acceleration of key result for children 8 – ending open defecation. The sub-prefecture approach launched jointly with the government, which aims to cover all villages within the targeted sub-prefecture, led to the first sub-prefecture to be awarded open defecation-free status in 2021.

WCAR,Democratic Republic of Congo,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"From a pilot humanitarian cash transfer to a shock-responsive social protection system 
To address the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19, UNICEF and WFP co-implemented a humanitarian cash assistance programme in N’sele, a peri-urban area of Kinshasa. Over a period of nine months, 19,100 vulnerable households received cash, supported through financial contribution of the United State agency for Humanitarian Assistance and the UK Foreign Commonwealth Development Office. The objective was to alleviate financial impacts of COVID-19 on vulnerable families in the immediate and medium-term.
The value of the monthly injection was calculated according to the survival minimum expenditure basket - the minimum amount required to cover lifesaving needs. This was intended to provide families with the capacity to start up small businesses, and access food, healthcare, and education.
The phased process applied facilitated the transition between humanitarian response, and longer-term development programmes, shifting from the coverage of immediate needs during the first three months, to building resilience of communities and systems, led by the Government. This “triple nexus” approach includes additional elements of social cohesion and peace.
The remaining six months of the programme, aimed at transitioning towards a social safety net model, covered 16,000 of the more vulnerable households identified by the communities themselves through Community-Based-Targeting. Progressive involvement of the Government reinforced its capacity in working with communities to identify beneficiaries and facilitated the development of tools such as the Social Registry, used to enroll families into social protection programmes. Support was further provided by a private sector partner to establish a Management Information System for managing lists of beneficiaries, monitoring transfer payments, and progress of activities.
It was integral during this project to engage with communities as active partners, ensuring their ownership. Community Animation Cells (CAC) and a network of 1500 community health workers were supported to manage the registration of families, as well as receive and communicate feedback from community members.
To ensure that gender dynamics were considered, UNICEF partnered with a local women-led organization to promote the use of cash to encourage women's empowerment through their integration into the labour market, by investing in small businesses. This partnership also increased the participation of women in family and community decision making, resulting in female representation within local CAC increasing from 30 to 80%. This pilot was implemented in settings where UNICEF was already actively supporting WASH, health, and other services for children. The integration of financial assistance with basic social services, a “cash plus” approach, was crucial to maximize the socio-economic impacts for improved well-being of children.
Capitalizing on these successes, in collaboration with the Belgian Government, over the next three years, UNICEF will work to further invest in institutional capacity and systems. The “cash plus” approach will be used to orient the implementation of the Government-led social safety net programme. Building national capacities and facilitating institutional and community ownership are central factors to ensure sustainable development, for maximum impact on communities and best outcomes for children.
Scaling up Gender, Gender-Based Violence (GBV) and Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) Interventions 
Building on the four-year Gender Strategy developed in 2020, last year was marked by the complementary scale up of PSEA and GBV response capacity. To translate the interconnection of these themes and planned interventions into action, an operational and programmatic tool - the Gender, GBV, PSEA mechanism (GGP) was developed, funded, and piloted. Principally, the tool addresses challenges highlighted through contextual issues, particularly faced by women and girls, such as the use of GBV as a weapon of conflict, and the increased risks associated with large humanitarian presence during emergency response.
To ensure sufficient financing in the operationalization of the approach, the UNICEF country office decided to allocate 1% of all resources mobilized in addition to some available core funds. As a result, an investment of approximately $3,200,000 has so far facilitated the increase in the number of GBV and PSEA partnerships, from three to eleven, including organisations lead by women in five provinces. This has improved the coverage of UNICEF services with the objective of addressing the specific needs of women and girls, ensuring their participation at all levels. As a result, women and girls are now consulted in programme design, and in some instances acting as safe reporting channels for cases of GBV and SEA, encouraging use of services by those in need.
Evidence generation through operational research has captured interlinkages between Gender, GBV and SEA. Two studies were conducted in collaboration with the Integrated Analytics Cell, exploring gender dynamics around malnutrition in Tanganyika province, and the underlying causes of anaemia in girls in Nsele. Findings highlighted barriers to women in accessing basic goods and services, limiting their capacity to care for children, adopt optimal feeding practices, and reach antenatal care services. Based on this evidence, adapted approaches will be integrated into UNICEF and partners’ response in 2022.
As a positive reflection of the use of this innovative mechanism, at the onset of the 13th Ebola outbreak in Beni, North Kivu, Gender, GBV and PSEA were for the first time integrated into the response of UNICEF and partners. This resulted in improved PSEA accountability across UN agencies, partners, and the Government, through the nomination of PSEA focal points, and an increased recruitment of female frontline workers. Also, to improve access to safer, community-based reporting channels and services for survivors, UNICEF partnered with a local women’s platform, and trained girls from a local youth council on PSEA and GBV. Finally, and of principal importance, data are now systematically disaggregated and analyzed by age and sex to ensure gender inclusiveness throughout responses.
Moving forward, the UNICEF DRC office will build on the key achievements and lessons learned highlighted through this report to strengthen the delivery of multisectoral services that best serve the needs of women and children. Ensuring gender-responsive and evidence-based decision making, partnerships with other UN agencies and civil society groups will continue to be leveraged to further invest in community-centric interventions which will best facilitate the transition between short-term humanitarian response and sustainable solutions."
WCAR,Equatorial Guinea,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Accelerating routine vaccination in the pandemic

Factors linked to COVID-19 impacted the supply and demand of essential services. From the demand side, there was a decrease in demand for immunization services due to transportation constraints; from the supply side, health workers for routine vaccination were assigned to vaccination against COVID-19. Almost 50% of the parents who participated in the survey of the multi-country evaluation on UNICEF’s contribution to immunization coverage, reported having experienced restrictions to access health services during the pandemic, especially in the rural areas. 

To mitigate these challenges and increase vaccination coverage, UNICEF and WHO supported the government in conducting an equity analysis to identify bottlenecks at the district level and address them. This analysis contributed to identifying unvaccinated children and allowed a more efficient allocation of UNICEF’s resources to reach them. The CO used this analysis to support the target districts by increasing the number of outreach visits and reinforcing the fixed vaccination posts with more staff. According to the multi-country evaluation findings, parents reported the following as main barriers to access vaccination services: their deficient quality (70%), transportation (69%) and other costs (66%). In response, UNICEF will collaborate with the MoH and partners to identify alternatives to overcome these barriers. 
 
The overestimation of the target population according to the last census also influenced the low immunization coverage. UNICEF, in collaboration with WHO, Medical Care Development International, and Fundacion de Religiosos para la Salud (FRS), updated the target population in 78% of the 18 health districts. This allowed some districts with very low coverage to achieve coverage of over 80% and contributed to avoiding vaccine stock-outs. 


Improved Learning Outcomes

UNICEF’s advocacy on the importance of measuring children’s learning to ensure foundational skills bore fruit; there were substantial progresses in improving the learning outcomes. Through UNICEF support, 14,032 primary students (7,136 from Grade 3; and 6,896 from Grade 6; 52% of girls and 48% of boys,) participated in the summative assessments to evaluate their learning outcomes primarily in Spanish and Mathematics. The Grade 6 students were evaluated on two additional subjects, Science and Social Science. The assessments were strategically conducted in two districts (Malabo and Bata) covering a significant number of Grade 3 (68%) and Grade 6 students (75%) in the country. The long-term vision of the government is to scale up the learning assessments to benefit all children in schools. 

To this end, UNICEF will continue to advocate and strategize for increased government financing to improve learning outcomes. While UNICEF provided support to launch learning assessments in the two major districts, the Ministry of Education used its own resources to pilot similar learning assessment exercise in other districts with the aim to re-introduce the concept of evaluating children to support better learning outcomes. While the learning assessments in other districts were somewhat rudimentary and lacked the same rigorous quality control in the procedures due to the limited resources, it was a significant step forward for the government to increasingly invest in education.  

The effects from the COVID-19 pandemic and school closures underpinned the importance of measuring learning outcomes for the government. It created an opportunity for the Ministry of Education to take an important decision in generating evidence about the realities in schools which is a comparatively courageous one given the context. 

Strengthening the Birth Registration System  

Despite the need to prioritize emergency responses in 2021, the CO achieved progress in modernizing the birth registration system. UNICEF's advocacy and technical support to the government benefitted from the existence of international and regional commitments. 

Although the Ministry of Justice remained as the principal counterpart to strengthen the birth registration system, UNICEF engaged with other stakeholders, such as the national authority in charge of the system of databases (CNIAPE), local governments and community leaders which proved to be beneficial. The role of local stakeholders was instrumental in removing access barriers for improved national coverage. The use of mobile units, capacity-building strategies and regular monitoring visits enhanced the government performance. 

The CO will continue advocating for the inter-ministerial collaboration to increase birth registration accessibility and coverage. As reported in the multi-country evaluation on immunization, there is room for improvement regarding synergies between the ministries of justice and health to keep the registry on live births integrated into the Immunization Plus Programme, starting from increasing the interoperability of their systems. Additionally, UNICEF will resume high-level dialogue with decision-makers to leverage birth registration as a priority in the national agenda.

Turning Emergencies into opportunities

The CO’s experience in responding to two emergencies concurrently (COVID-19, in 2020-2021 and the Bata explosions) was a valuable opportunity for innovation, technical dialogue, political advocacy, and for gaining influence in public-policy making process.

Among the innovations, UNICEF’s social protection response in emergencies included the country’s first design and implementation of a HCT programme. Other innovations supported by UNICEF were the strengthening of the RUS. The RUS was not only used for targeting, and monitoring but also for transparency and accountability purposes. Building on the CO’s lessons learned from 2020 regarding the use of mobile money, the HCT programme used the same modality to reach beneficiaries with limited or no access to bank services. Through the successful use of these tools in the field, the government has recognized them as key components of a social protection system. 

As recommended in the MTR, the CO will systematize this experience and include it in a broader but integrated advocacy strategy for policy. This systematization will be carried out with a participatory methodology and support the CO’s shift towards a system strengthening and policy formulation approach.  

Looking ahead

These lessons learned along with reflections held during the mid-term review will inform UNICEF’s programme priorities and actions leading to the next country programme in 2024. In the meantime, the CO will continue its efforts to accelerate results particularly in immunization, learning outcomes and birth registrations while using social protection, advocacy for data and for increased financing for children and innovative partnerships, as key strategies to accelerate progress and achieve results.

WCAR,Gabon,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Innovation programmatique  
Captage, stockage, traitement et utilisation des eaux de pluie : Une solution innovante, simple, coût-efficace, adaptée à l’environnement local pour le contrôle et la prévention des infections en milieu scolaire. Sa mise à l’échelle nécessite une appropriation nationale, une approche de communication favorable et un cadre de financement flexible et adapté aux capacités des écoles.

L’enquête sur la situation de l’eau dans les écoles au Gabon indique que 15 % d’écoles n’ont aucun point d’eau, 12 % ont un point d’eau non amélioré et 36 % ont un point d’eau, mais non-fonctionnel. Alors, UNICEF a collaboré avec le Gouvernement et la Banque Mondiale pour proposer des solutions innovantes adaptées au profil des écoles. 
 
Pour des établissements en milieu rural ou péri-urbain non desservis par le réseau conventionnel, l'initiative de captage, de stockage, de traitement et d’utilisation des eaux de pluie s’est révélée être une solution simple, écologique et coût-efficace dont l’appropriation constitue une innovation programmatique prometteuse et susceptible d’être portée rapidement à l’échelle. 

Pour y parvenir, le Bureau a développé une preuve de concept et deux prototypes qui ont été expérimentés dans 5 établissements scolaires au profit de 1 872 élèves et enseignants. Cette solution s’appuie sur des facteurs de succès suivants : une pluviométrie exceptionnelle (3 000 mm par an) ; l’utilisation d’un matériau disponible sur le marché local ; un coût raisonnable (14 fois moins cher qu’un forage), la mise en place de comité de gestion ayant des responsabilités dans la sécurité sanitaire (formation au traitement de l’eau), le suivi de la qualité de l’eau et de la maintenance des équipements.

Pour le passage à l’échelle, il est important d’investir dans la communication de changement sur le modèle de « Changement Social & de Comportement » autour des normes sociales positives et la promotion des solutions locales adaptées. Pour cela, il sera nécessaire de mettre en place des mécanismes de contrôles périodiques et de tests physico-chimiques de l’eau produite afin d’en garantir l’utilisation au-delà des besoins de lavage de mains, nettoyage et assainissement, et couvrir possiblement des besoins d’eau de boisson.

Cette expérience à petite échelle, montre que des solutions simples et souvent très accessibles peuvent être de bonnes alternatives aux réponses complexes et coûteuses. Une possible réplication permettrait de résoudre les problèmes d’accès à l’eau dans les établissements scolaires et les structures sanitaires qui souffrent des problèmes similaires.

Enfin, ce type d'intervention ciblée représente l’avenir du modèle de coopération de l’UNICEF dans un pays à revenu intermédiaire de la tranche supérieure à faibles indicateurs sociaux (comme le Gabon) : modéliser des approches simples, innovantes et coût-efficace pour répondre aux besoins concrets tout en recherchant un engagement politique des décideurs et l’influence des dépenses publiques pour faire avancer les droits de l’enfant.


Leçons apprises
Accélérer la vaccination à travers une co-création stratégique et opérationnelle impliquant des acteurs au-delà du secteur de la santé et budgétiser au-delà de l’achat des vaccins et des campagnes. Depuis environ une décennie, la vaccination des enfants au Gabon connaît de nombreuses difficultés. Elle est caractérisée par la stagnation et des reculs dont les conséquences sur la survie des enfants pourraient être les faibles progrès dans la réduction du taux de mortalité des enfants de moins 5 ans. Ne pouvant pas bénéficier des avantages des pays GAVI, le Gouvernement du Gabon a maintenu ses efforts pour assurer la vaccination par l’achat des vaccins et des intrants. 
 
Toutefois, les analyses conduites par l’UNICEF et d’autres partenaires montrent qu'en plus de budgétiser pour le renforcement de la vaccination dans toutes ses composantes plutôt que pour le seul achat des vaccins, d’autres acteurs comme la société civile, le secteur privé, le monde politique au niveau national et déconcentré devraient être impliqués dans la gouvernance de la vaccination. Ils devront jouer un rôle dans les différentes activités stratégiques (développement des plans pluriannuels, discussions budgétaires) et opérationnelles (engagement des communautés, micro-planification et discussions des performances de chaque département). L’application de cette démarche – soutenue et portée par l’UNICEF et l’OMS - a déjà permis la mise en place d’un comité de coordination de partenaires (y compris la société civile, le Parlement, la Banque Mondiale, l’AFD, le FMI, le Rotary Club…) autour de la vaccination sous le leadership du Ministre de la Santé. Ce cadre de dialogue constitue une grande première au Gabon et dénote de la prise de conscience d’investir dans la vaccination – pilier essentiel du capital social de l’enfant.

Par ailleurs, il ressort que la faiblesse des soins de santé primaire, le niveau d’urbanisation, l’importance des centres privés de soins et le système de santé hospitalo-centrique exigent de repenser complètement la stratégie de vaccination.

S'appuyer sur des interventions - effet de levier - à couverture limitée pour démontrer des résultats et engager des partenariats pour des réformes, le plaidoyer et des allocations budgétaires en faveur de résultats à plus grande échelle. Le programme conjoint « Citoyenneté et Protection Sociale » dont l’UNICEF est le chef de file a permis de confirmer l’importance d’intégrer - dès la planification - des stratégies transformatrices dont la vocation est d’apporter des solutions concrètes aux besoins de populations, et de travailler en même temps pour des solutions politiques, légales et budgétaires plus larges. C’est ainsi que des résultats probants pour garantir une existence légale et l’accès à la protection sociale à 23 000 personnes (environ un tiers de la population sans acte de naissance) ont facilité la modification du délai de déclaration de naissance et la consécration de la gratuité des certificats d’accouchement dans les formations hospitalières. Ces réformes structurelles [1] aident à lever un important goulot d’étranglement et de repositionner stratégiquement l’offre de ces services dans le portefeuille du Gouvernement.

WCAR,Gambia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Programme implementation in 2021 during the country programme’s penultimate year corroborates that GCO is moving in the right direction and that the outcome areas are still relevant and responsive to the situation of children in The Gambia.  The year has also produced key lessons that will influence the new country programme development exercise in 2022.  The lessons learned speak less of the need to change priorities, but rather how to work differently and more strategically to improve children’s rights in the country, including through new change strategies, accelerators and innovations. Underlying this approach is the long-term impact that COVID19 continues to have on the social and economic fabric of the country. 
 
Strengthening the convergence between the policy and legislative framework and service delivery is fundamental to secure sustainable results for children.  For example, in the area of child protection, existing legislation to curtail harmful practices against children, such as FGM and child marriage, is not accompanied by the necessary enforcement mechanisms to hold perpetrators accountable, nor with the required interventions to generate stronger community awareness that translates into more effective local detection and prevention mechanisms.  Also, whilst the National Early Childhood Education Policy calls for a multisectoral approach involving multiple sectors dealing with young children, there is no mechanism to enforce an adequate and common platform for inter-sectoral coordination and collaboration, which has a detrimental effect on the efficient use of scarce resources.  Compounding the lack of integration between policy frameworks and social delivery is insufficient fiscal space, thus leading GCO to accelerate the integration of the PF4C and social protection agendas with the relevant social sector agendas. 
 
GCO has been involved in developing a number of models that have demonstrated relative success, but it is important to determine whether their proof of concept can help to reach children at scale.  For example, the innovative approach of focusing on a set of critical health seeking and child protective behaviours has demonstrated that ensuring a holistic and integrated approach to social and behavior change communication helps to achieve sustainable results and outcomes for children by ensuring that communities are reached with common messages and are empowered to take action.  Other innovations, such as the low-cost Mother Mid-Upper Arm Circumference project that empowers women with the knowledge and skills to monitor child malnutrition at the household level, or the use of the bottom-up community engagement approach (Nsa Kenno) through decentralized community structures, are examples of models that can be taken to wider reach and scale, especially if they can be normalized into the existing policy and programmatic framework.  For this effect, GCO will need to improve the theories of change related to these areas and take corrective actions regarding resource allocation, institutional collaboration and partnership development. 
 
The situation analysis validation exercise which kickstarted the 2023-2027 country programme exercise confirmed the important role that GCO plays in filling key data and evidence gaps related to children.  The validation permitted an exhaustive review of the scope and quality of sectoral data production and underscored the availability of comprehensive routine and survey datasets, especially in health, nutrition and education, but less so in child protection.  However, there is a dearth of evaluative information in key sectors and an absence of certain types of data to illustrate cross-cutting and mutually reinforcing causes that could help to produce a more precise picture of who are the most vulnerable and excluded children.  Whilst available data points to children with disabilities, living in poor rural households, out-of-school, unemployed youth, undernourished infants and victims of harmful practices and violence as the most vulnerable, it is more difficult to identify drivers of inequity within and between these groups and GCO will need to prioritize this as part of the new country programme cycle.  In turn, this will strengthen evidence-based public advocacy as a change accelerator for children, as documented in interventions such as reaching ODF status, identifying households with severely malnourished children, combatting harmful practices and improving learning outcomes. 
 
Despite the fact that multi-sectoral coordination and implementation is a strategic accelerator in the current country programme, progress has not been strong.  In 2021, however, positive experiences are starting to illustrate the potential to achieve a paradigm shift to address multiple childhood deprivations.  For example, strengthened collaboration between the child survival and protection teams on birth registration presents a platform to accelerate birth registration rates whilst simultaneously strengthening the health care delivery system through capacity building thereby narrowing the gap between vaccinated children and children without a birth certificate.  GCO will continue intensifying this model, ensuring that it is adequately informed by a theory of change and documented for high-level advocacy, and apply the lessons learned to other potential collaborations.  
 
Youth aged 15-25 years represent more than 35% of the population and GCO’s excellent work with partners such as the National Youth Council and U-Reporters, as well as consulting them in key programming milestones, confirms the need for a more robust youth empowerment and development strategy.  Of particular importance is the need for GCO to delve more into areas such as climate change, the environmental crisis, mental health and other emerging areas and to mobilize this cohort to innovate solutions for accelerated results for children and leverage networks for increased social accountability and improved national and local governance.  
 
COVID19 has forced shifts from traditional ways of delivering services for children and uncovered new realities and limitations.  For example, looking beyond the in-class mode to addressing the weakness of distance and digital learning platforms has made it even more urgent to recuperate learning loss, especially for those children living in remote locations without electricity and internet.  Vaccine hesitancy, whilst quite specific to COVID19, suggests that non-traditional social and behavioural change and communication strategies, including more person-to-person engagements, will need to be amplified.  COVID19 also exposed weaknesses in social protection as well as critical child protection services, such as the situation of children in juvenile wings of prisons highlighting the absence of alternative modes of correction.  These are new opportunities for GCO.  

"
WCAR,Ghana,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The country office invested in several research and evaluation products in 2021, generating valuable lessons learned, which were considered in the development of the next country programme of cooperation. For example:
 

The UNICEF-supported research entitled “Citizens’ knowledge and perceptions about poverty, vulnerability and social protection in Ghana: a baseline study” examined understanding, perceptions and attitudes about poverty and vulnerability, and participation in social protection programmes. The study, which was nominated for the Best of UNICEF Research 2021, recommended better public sensitization about the causes of poverty and vulnerability. It sought to address what was suggested to be a common confusion that poverty and vulnerability are synonymous, and to highlight circumstances at various stages in life, which could render anyone poor or vulnerable. The study also identified the importance of securing an adequate institutional and legal basis for reliable financing, rights-based messaging, grievance, and redress mechanisms. It highlighted the need to secure the quality of existing programmes, the adequacy benefits, expanded coverage, and streamlining targeting mechanisms to reduce inclusion and exclusion errors. It also suggested developing universal social programmes in the long run, while in the short run ensuring adequate coverage for citizens considered more vulnerable or prone to poverty. The study also recommended that social protection strategies should be specific to the needs of urban and rural populations, and that poverty and vulnerability are not mainly a rural phenomenon.
 

In Ghana, high levels of neonatal and maternal mortality are prevalent despite high antenatal care attendance, skilled delivery and post-natal care coverage. UNICEF therefore supported an assessment of Emergency Obstetric & Newborn Care (EmONC) to explore possible causal links behind mortality and quality of care. The survey was implemented by GHS across 1,713 facilities in all 16 regions, and revealed that only 136 facilities (less than 10 percent) were compliant with EmONC standards. Over 60 percent of facilities lacked adequate supplies, equipment & drugs and 99% of facilities designated as delivery points were missing at least one signal function. Similarly, an assessment of Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) standards across 25 districts of the Ashanti Region showed that only 40% facilities had dedicated space for KMC, and 88% of health staff had no formal training in this area. Moreover, 60% of newborn care units had no handwashing and toilet facilities. Both assessments highlight the improvements needed to improve quality of care levels.
 

A formative and summative evaluation of the Government of Ghana and UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme (2012-2019) was finalized in 2021. Stretching across two programme cycles, the evaluation covered implementation at national and sub-national levels, collecting evidence of changes in the child protection system, and working backwards to determine whether and how UNICEF contributed to those changes. The evaluation aimed to clarify the changes in child protection in Ghana that have been brought about by UNICEF’s programming, and to determine whether the current programme has the right strategic focus to contribute to strengthening the child protection system moving forward. It identified three key lessons. 
Firstly, building a fully functioning child protection system involves not only the introduction of a legislative framework, but also effective governance structures; a continuum of services, human, financial and infrastructure resources; robust data collection and monitoring systems; minimum standards and oversight and mechanisms for child participation and community engagement. These require long-term commitment to raise public awareness, train stakeholders on new policies, laws and practices, and ensure their full implementation. It can take over three or more country programme cycles to strengthen systems and reach a level of maturity.
Secondly, the identification and appropriate referral of cases is essential to the systematic delivery of effective response services. This requires both effective referral processes and widespread training and awareness raising over time. Education and health services are the most likely to encounter children who have suffered or are at risk of suffering from violence, abuse, neglect or exploitation. These services therefore require repeated and continued training to understand and utilize the referral process. 
Thirdly, significant improvement has been made over time in attitudes and practices across a range of issues, such as the placement of children in residential care or in boarding schools. There has been less attitudinal change regarding the use of corporal punishment and towards child marriage in rural and less educated communities. The latter lesson was also supported by the ‘Multi-Country Evaluation of Community Engagement to End Child Marriage in Ghana (2016-2019)’, conducted in 2020-2021, which noted that community mobilization, capacity building for the social service workforce, and referrals between services remain a challenge and require additional investment. More targeted interventions will be needed, especially in the regions showing slower progress towards ending child marriage.
 

An operational research titled ‘Understanding the impacts of a targeted toilet subsidy in Ghana’ was undertaken by UNICEF and WASH Partnerships and Learning for Sustainability (WASHPals). It reviewed the appropriateness and effectiveness of targeting criteria for the ‘pro-poor’ grant component of the District Sanitation Fund (DSF). The DSF is a revolving loan scheme that provides small loans to households and sanitation businesses with flexible payment terms and subsidized interest rates. Its social support scheme enables households from the poorest quintile to build household latrines at no cost. Eligible households are selected based on a comprehensive ‘ground truthing’ criteria intended to identify only the households that would be unable to build latrines without external support. The research tested the reliability of criteria, finding that of the 508 households identified for support, 444 (86 percent) met the eligibility criteria. It also found that of the 444 households, 441 (99 percent) built toilets and sustained their use. The research found therefore that the targeting criteria was adequate, and funds were utilized for the outcome intended. It also showed that only a small proportion of the poorest households require subsidies, and that the majority of household can avail of small capital loans where available and affordable. The research also strongly supported advocacy for the establishment of a national revolving fund to support access by households to affordable sanitation. 

"
WCAR,Guinea,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The political unrest and health crises in 2021 exacerbated vulnerabilities and exposed gaps in national systems, thus highlighting the need for system strengthening. The epidemic outbreaks also presented opportunities for innovation, as well as strengthening of existing approaches to include response measures.  
 
Lessons from the first Ebola epidemic facilitated a rapid response to multiple epidemics in 2021 by tapping into existing laboratory, surveillance and treatment infrastructure, as well as adopting the ‘no regrets’ approach as soon as the epidemic was declared. UNICEF responded by mobilizing all programme sectors to deliver a coordinated response. UNICEF’s ongoing knowledge sharing with the Democratic Republic of the Congo Country Office on managing multiple epidemics also strengthened the response in Guinea. Thanks to effective coordination for diagnosis, isolation, case management, vaccination and community mobilization, the outbreak was controlled within one region hence and was not as devastating as the first epidemic. In addition, community engagement with religious and community leaders, women’s groups and youth associations were also key actors for maintaining the continuity of social services. 
 
UNICEF supported the digitalization of social services to improve quality and accountability. There was a major shift in the monitoring of immunization services through the digitalization of the vaccination registry and the operationalization of the SMS vaccination reminder programme in Conakry city and two prefectures (Labé and Boffa). This programme improvement sends automated voice messages in local languages to remind mothers and caregivers of vaccination appointments. ¿¿In 2021, UNICEF began developing a system for monitoring violence, rape and sexual harassment through a digital platform and mobile application.
 
Digital solutions were deployed to improve the education information and management system, thus making quality and timely data available to decision-makers, and improving the relevance of the education system for the 21st century. UNICEF also supported the use of a digital application to collect school statistical data. This innovation made it possible to compile the necessary data within the time required to finalize the school yearbooks, which is a remarkable improvement from previous years.
 
UNICEF focused on sustainable innovations to improving access to drinking water using mixed solar water supply technology at-scale in the hardest-to-reach areas. Through the construction of 63 solar water systems in Kindia, Kankan, Labé and Boké regions, 48,010 people gained sustainable and safe access to water. This approach strengthened capacities of the private sector and the National Water Point Service of Guinea (SNAPE) to advocate for this approach. 
 
Supporting community engagement and strengthening the availability of services at the community level is essential to building approaches which are resilient to the challenges faced. Debates with women’s groups and youth associations regarding harmful practices such as female genital mutilation and child marriage nurtured new agents of change for social norms who better understand social pressures and can convey essential messages for behavior change. 
 
Given the political insecurity that prevailed in 2021, UNICEF’s approach to co-create strategies with ministries, service providers and other stakeholders was critical to advancing key results during the transitional period. This was applied for the case of developing the digitalization roadmap with the Ministry of Education and education partners. However, it should be noted that the high turnover of Ministry teams following the recent political change proved to be a major constraint for the ownership and timely implementation of the country programme’s annual workplan. The Government’s commitment to ending violence against children (December 2021) presents a major opportunity to jointly develop child protection interventions and reinforce strong, inclusive institutional and community protection systems. UNICEF will expand partnerships with key private sector and civil society stakeholders to maintain support for children during this transitional period. UNICEF’s technical assistance for strengthening local development and investment plans, as well as performance-based financing mechanisms, has shown promise in the targeted convergence municipalities for increased allocation for promoting women and children’s rights.
 
In 2021, UNICEF strengthened cross-sectoral collaboration to maximize both resources and opportunities to reach the hardest-to-reach children. UNICEF integrated a three-pronged approach linking the vitamin A supplementation campaign to birth registration and child malnutrition screening. As a result of this one-week campaign, 98,000 additional births were registered, and 72% (2,074,341 children) of supplemented children were screened - leading to 78,480 children identified as malnourished (including 39,240 with SAM) and referred to health centres. This promoted efficiency and cost-effectiveness, and shows promise for scaling up and expanding to additional multi-sectoral interventions. The involvement of women's groups was also an important approach to deliver integrated nutrition, health, WASH and social protection services for children and women in their communities. Cross-sectoral evidence generation, including the gender dynamics of COVID-19 and UNICEF’s study on menstrual hygiene management, are key resources for improving gender-sensitivity, addressing bottlenecks and promoting a comprehensive package of services for women and girls.
 
Based on the progress and lessons learned in 2021, in the final year of the Guinea-UNICEF country programme (2018-2022), UNICEF will focus on integrating and scaling up humanitarian-development nexus programming to maximize results for women and children, while ensuring alignment with the roadmap of the transitional government. Digital innovations will continue to be developed across UNICEF’s programmes to promote quality services, improve accessibility, address accountability and enhance sector management. The cash transfer approach will be explored for other UNICEF programmes, including nutrition for promoting dietary diversity.
 
Improving data quality will be emphasized, including real-time monitoring for health and the deployment of the Child Protection Information Management System (CPIMS+/Primero). UNICEF will analyze the success factors and limitations, build strategies to leverage these results, as well as generate evidence to inform programme approaches.  
 
UNICEF will pursue opportunities to implement cross-sectoral approaches to maximize the impact for children and to enable an integrated and continuous delivery of services. Additionally, greater emphasis will be placed on geographical synergies. To capitalize on these opportunities, UNICEF’s resource mobilization strategy will focus on expanding the funding base – including private sector partnerships, and leveraging domestic resources to accelerate results for children.

"
WCAR,Guinea Bissau,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Key lessons learned during the course of programme implementation point to the need to enhance coherence in programme delivery, improve results-based and partnership management, and stewardship over resources. Greater accompaniment of implementing partners, including for judicious financial management in addition to technical capacity strengthening are necessary conditions to emphasise for the new country programme to kick-off in 2022 with the best chances of improving outcomes for children.

Reprogramming of government and partner resources to the COVID response, and the focus on COVID-19 vaccination campaigns has been detrimental to the provision of other health services, disrupting the continuity of mother and child health care provision. Towards the end of the year, UNICEF greatly advocated for a rationalization of support to primary healthcare provision which became central to the agenda of the COVID-19 coordination meetings. It will be important going forward to reinforce the key message of integration of COVID-19 response actions into opportunities for strengthening primary health care in the country and for full commitment by stakeholders. Coordination between the MoH and the High Commission in addressing will need to be reinforced to avoid the existence of parallel intervention tracks and build on opportunities for strengthening supply chains and service delivery. 
 
Vertical implementation of components of the community health programme (CHP) financed by different partners undermines systematic provision of maternal, new-born and childcare. The UNICEF supported evaluation of the national community health programme highlights the need for improved efficiencies in the delivery of interventions. This will require strengthened leadership for tighter coordination between interdependent components and health partners and more technical support to planning, budgeting, and execution of the CHP in tandem with PHC systems strengthening.  In this regard, UNICEF will push for more concerted action in the implementation of the recently concluded 2021 -2025 CHP Strategic Plan.
 
WATER, SANITATION AND HYGIENE
Physical presence is key to the adaptations necessary on the ground. Real-time monitoring in the distribution of critical WASH supplies to schools and hygiene promotion provided important avenue to apprehend the adequacy of supplies and their utilisation, facilitating transportation and stock management. This equally helped understand the dynamics and manage the effects of teacher's strikes where schools and communities adopted alternative solutions to enable the delivery of assistance.  The UNICEF developed mWater platform is an innovation can be expanded for use by other sectors to support real-time monitoring and information management for better programme delivery.
 
UNICEF Guinea Bissau needs to more forcefully leverage partnerships and resources for the elaboration and implementation of a costed plan to reach the last mile to be Open Defecation Free. Whilst a solid strategy exists towards the elimination of open defecation which has enabled arrival at 10.3%, the lack of contributions from the national budget and development aid for WASH will not facilitate sustainability of the current momentum needed to reach the target.
 
EDUCATION EQUITY AND QUALITY
 
Development of alternative pathways for children’s learning under the COVID-19 emergency response offered the possibility of addressing long-standing challenges with access to education for out-of-school children. It accelerated the development of distance learning programmes and improved chances for learning continuity, even with other types of disruptions to fragile education system, notably teacher strikes. The multifaceted response needed to address the impact of the COVID pandemic provided opportunities to focus efforts on multidimensional barriers. 
 
Communication with donors on flexibility to fund cross-sectoral interventions is primordial in a resource-strapped context. GPE funding facilitated social protection, child protection and WASH interventions, allowing the continuity of learning during the height of the COVID-19 crisis. Cross-sectoral engagement allowed improvements to the school environment, through the provision of resources and training to address inclusion, corporal punishment, school-related gender-based violence (SRGBV), menstrual hygiene management (MHM). Cross-sectoral engagement for a shock-responsive social protection scheme for families and children, relieved families from financial constraints, allowing children to continue schooling, especially at-risk girls. 
 
The crisis and the ensuing response provided UNICEF the opportunity to accelerate reforms through mentoring and technical assistance to the Ministry of Education, particularly in relation to the development of a national strategy for distance learning to benefit out-of-school children and the implementation of catch-up programs to minimize the loss of learning due to the impact of COVID on children's education over the past two years.
 
CHILD PROTECTION
 
Although efforts were made to strengthen information and data gathering on child protection, the inter-operable management system to support incident monitoring and track case management is still a major constraint and will be a key priority for the new CP programme, starting in 2022. In view of this, the harmonization of data gathering efforts will be supported to avoid parallel systems. A well-developed information management system is a key starting point for an effective child protection case management system. 
 
The quality of community dialogue and outreach to families and influencers needs to be improved with better design of the Social and Behaviour Change communication (SBCC) strategy for child protection, in order to make progress in ending FGM, child marriage and other harmful practices in a more impactful manner. This needs to be based on improved understanding of communities and the deployment of innovative approaches to sustainably shift behaviours.
 
SOCIAL POLICY, PLANNING, MONITORING AND EVALUATION
The high number of national policies and strategies which need updating provides a unique opportunity for influencing the development of child-centred costed plans at the national and sub-national level. Improved capacities in public finance management for children will be needed. Partnerships with financial institutions as a result including, the African Development Bank, IMF, UEMOA and the World Bank should be strengthened in this regard.
 
Weaknesses in national and sub-national data collection and management systems of priority social sectors that UNICEF supports have proven to be a major handicap for evidence generation for planning, management, and reporting, particularly during COVID emergency response. Data gaps further impede implementation monitoring of key interventions. More investments will need to be made to data management systems to support the tracking of progress on results and the establishment of accountability systems.
"
WCAR,Liberia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In managing emergencies (both the COVID-19 pandemic and other recurrent humanitarian emergency threats), the main lesson learned by the Liberia Country Office (LCO) is the need to be better prepared in terms of human resource capacity for emergency coordination. Emergencies at LCO level are managed by a pool of focal points. The absence of dedicated staff (Emergency Specialist) is mainly due to limited financial resources. The LCO benefited from a stretch assignment to support in building the capacity within the office as well as of key national counterparts. 
A lesson learned across programmes was that the success and sustainability of interventions depends on sustained engagement with communities. UNICEF For example, direct involvement of people living with HIV was key to case identification through the Family HIV Testing model. Community engagement also ensures their sustainability WASH projects and played a critical role in sustaining demand creation for education. It also influences the development, implementation and oversight of systems, policies and initiatives that aim to achieve improved outcomes for children. Increased focus on multi-sectorial programming has demonstrated success in reaching results for children at scale. 
Another lesson learned was the benefit of closer and more detailed engagement with government partners. To achieve an impact on Key Results for Children, implementation modalities were patiently worked through with partners. This entailed a balance between implementing quickly and implementing with laser focus on results for children. Providing ample time for discussions, negotiations on modalities, and rescheduling where necessary for smooth implementation. 
In Education, for example, close engagement with MoE enhanced trust and cooperation. LCO engagement in Joint Education Sector Review discussions and technical support provided an avenue for a holistic view of education sector planning and implementation, and an opportunity to align Liberian education standards with best practices from around the region. 
Integrated programming and using campaign (partners’) logistical resources to support routine health services during campaigns was also a lesson learned: e.g. delivery of health commodities along with vaccine delivery and the integration of BR with the nOPV campaigns helped reach the most vulnerable children with health care. Mainstreaming BR interventions in adolescent empowerment programmes helped increase demand for BR services, while mainstreaming child protection messages and interventions in the context of both emergency and development proved effective. 
Innovations
Innovations used to improve health campaign coverage included use of mobile phone service providers to disseminate campaign messages to subscribers; UNICEF supported the MoH to establish a misinformation platform to monitor rumors around the introduction of the nOPV2 vaccine and used of community radio stations to dispel rumours and misinformation; and involvement of local government authorities to resolve vaccine hesitancy. 
Development of Real-Time Monitoring Tool that gets information directly from 245 schools across all counties is an innovation that has great potential for expansion. The Tool tracks information reported weekly on dropout and how parents are managing the learning experiences of their children. The Tool can be the basis for developing a database that can generate much-needed information on administrative issues at school level.
Establishment of community-based ECD centres to be run by women in the communities and mothers of the children in the centres is an innovative way of strengthening ECD centres and ensuring age-appropriate enrolment. 
Emerging opportunities
To address entrenched inequities, including geographic disparities, UNICEF has established a partnership with the Ministry of Internal Affairs which is mandated with decentralization in Liberia to enhance better programming for children at subnational level.  In 2021, to deepen engagement with communities and county governments, UNICEF established an outpost at Zwedru in Grand Gedeh County. In partnership with the Ministry of Internal Affairs, UNICEF intends to develop local government capacity in planning and budgeting child-friendly programming, leveraging resources and monitoring child rights. 
The National Multisectoral Plan of Action for Nutrition currently being costed will guide a multisectoral approach to reducing stunting and preventing all forms of malnutrition. It will engage food, social protection, WASH (apart from health) and education systems. An SBCC strategy is being developed and will help accelerate behaviour change and adoption of optimal nutrition practices. Adaptation of the complementary feeding bowl by Liberia and its piloting will help caregivers identify ways to improve both the quality and quantity of children’s diets. 
UNICEF’s positioning with ECOWAS and GoL in signing an MoU for the operationalization of the ECOWAS Framework on child protection system strengthening will help Liberia create an operational multisectoral strategy to prevent and respond to violence, abuse and exploitation of children in both emergencies and developmental programmes. UNICEF supported GoL and CSOs to undertake a social service workforce mapping and assessment. This will inform the development of a national capacity-building strategy and plan for developing the social service workforce.
A costed national Road Map to end OD by 2025 was launched in November 2021. It is pending endorsement by the President of Liberia, but implementation should begin in 2022. In light of the results achieved through community mobilization, both Education and Child Protection have developed robust SBCC strategies to expand community engagement in 2022, and work is ongoing on a Nutrition SBCC strategy. 
UNICEF Liberia embarked on a Data Landscape Diagnostic and developing a Strategic Action Plan of data for children. A concept note and terms of reference were finalized. The Strategic Action Plan will guide future investments to address data gaps, forge partnerships, mobilize and leverage resources for improved data in Liberia, and accelerate implementation of the Leave No One Behind approach.
UNICEF initiated conceptualization of the mid-term review of the current country programme (CP) 2020–2024, due in mid-2022. The review includes undertaking an evaluability assessment, updating the situation analysis of children, review of progress on implementation of the country programme  undertaking revisions responding to changes in the programming environment including pandemic-related implications, evolving risk to child rights programming, and integrating the new Strategic Plan 2021–2025. The MTR will also build on the recommendations of the peer review exercise and the audit undertaken in 2021.  
"
WCAR,Mali,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The life-cycle approach places the child at the heart of programming, making it possible to cover the full spectrum of needs by age group, reinforcing UNICEF’s comparative advantages and building strategic and operational partnerships for greater impact for children. 
Specific lessons learned across interventions:  
The integrated multi-sector (health-nutrition-WASH, Education and Child Protection) and multi-agency (FAO, WFP, UNICEF) programs have strengthened the resilience of communities, accelerated key results for children at scale and improved the living conditions of vulnerable populations. The coordination included synergies between health and civil registration services to ensure that all births are registered, providing support for parents and caregivers on responsive care and early stimulation through existing health-nutrition services, and building systems’ capacities and food chain as well s the accountabilities for the most deprived children, adolescents, and women. 
Alternative learning via solar radios is relevant in the Malian context where humanitarian and structural challenges affecting education are intertwined. In the context of crisis and insecure roads to school, education in the home via the radio can be a complementary approach that allows children to maintain a learning routine, to catch-up on lessons and to be prepared to return to school. Child protection messages included in the radio learning programs contributed to the creation of a child-sensitive and protective environment. 
The intensification of the armed conflict and insecurity in the center of Mali (regions of Segou and Mopti), limited access, needs of children perceived as vulnerable. Accelerating children’s access to justice along the humanitarian-peacebuilding-development continuum, including for survivors of violence, will remain crucial. The agile approach with mobile teams should remain a key ending VAC and GBV result accelerators. It allows social workers and psychologists to visit families and communities to provide recreational psychosocial support to the most vulnerable children through individual or small-group activities.
The COVID-19 response in Mali has highlighted the need to reinforce both humanitarian and development financing to strengthen systems, and further enhance the role of beneficiaries in emergency preparedness and response. The national social protection system was identified as a powerful tool to meet humanitarian needs for the most deprived children, meanwhile also spotlighted the need to implement risk-informed cash transfer modalities that can effectively preempt and respond to shocks, and to the impact of displacement in the conflict zones.
Findings from ""Change Childhood project"" shown overwhelming majorities of young people think childhood has improved in most area in Mali. 70% young are more at ease with the role of digital technology in children’s lives, seeing greater benefits. The digital awareness and skills for both staff and partners to facilitate full utilization of newly deployed technologies in programming should be considered a priority.
Innovations
UNICEF strengthened mechanisms for accountability to affected communities through the development of technology platforms as an enabler for monitoring results in emergency. Whilst consolidating its technology for development (T4D) portfolio across programs to map the most deprived communities for interventions, UNICEF has developed protocols for data collection and analysis in emergency such as WASH-FIT, CAPI (Computer Assisted Personal Interview), ODK (Open Data Kit) platforms for real-time monitoring of interventions.
The Regional Solar Technical Initiative made it possible to provide specialized technical support on all aspects related to solar water systems and to build capacities of 35 WASH actors in Mali. The introduction of new technologies, such as DOSATRON, a new water chlorination pump that supports proportional dosing and operates without electricity. 
Interoperability between the health and civil registry systems has progressed. UNICEF supported the integration of birth registration in the 13-essential family practice, sensitization tools and DHIS-2. UNICEF has also provided Government and partners with Rapidpro, a digital tool for the efficient collection and transmission of BR data.  Use of Rapidpro has provided the country with data on the number of children registered at birth in each municipality, district, and region, in relation to the number of children who have a birth certificate, and to the number of children registered within and outside the legal timeframe. 
As part of “greening-the-office “, 170 kWp solar system is installed in the main UNICEF Office in Bamako. All air conditioners were replaced with more eco-friendly inverter type and the Country Office uses multi-function printers. 
Taking forward the lessons learned
In 2022, UNICEF will continue providing a comprehensive package that is gender-responsive, shock response and tailored to each stage of a child’s life. Maintaining a solid footprint on the ground, focus will be on delivering KRC to reach the legging behind CPD and UNSDCF child related indicators. UNICEF will actively be engaging young people in exploring solutions to the problems they face can contribute to the sustainability of solutions and vital for positive social norm change.
Capacity building for KCR at scale will be shifted to the sub-national l level. In partnership with the Government, UNICEF will build on local facilitators and community-level leaders for comprehensive and integrated approaches to accelerate eight targeted key results for the most at risk children. 
UNICEF will invest on digital platforms for distance learning such as learning passport. It represents an incredible opportunity to adapt schooling and sustain learning. UNICEF will promote value-for money thinking and secure the most cost-effective means of engaging with the most disadvantaged children and families across community platforms to increase accessibility for targeted end-user.
To fully realize UNICEF’s outcome objectives, a continued focus on several innovative partnerships will be established, maintained, and further supported by the management. Efforts to support resilience to humanitarian crisis and climate change will similarly be prioritized throughout the remainder of the current CPD and will be supported by evidence. 
Systems strengthening and implementing the development program while continuing to support the humanitarian response will be strategically and adequately resourced.  In 2022, UNICEF will continue to improve complementarity to achieve outputs without compromising either program. "
WCAR,Mauritania,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"L’année 2021 a été marquée par le renforcement de la convergence géographique et de l’intersectorialité à travers la promotion intégrée nutrition/hygiène/assainissement (KRC#2/8), la prévention des violences (KRC#5) dans le programme scolaire (KRC#3) en vue de renforcer la résilience des communautés.
Les groupes d’apprentissage de suivi des pratiques optimales d’ANJE (GASPA) ont confirmé leur valeur ajoutée au niveau communautaire à travers l’augmentation significative de l’allaitement maternelle exclusif. Ces groupes constituent des plateformes multisectorielles de coordination communautaire et présentent une solution possible pour la prévention durable de la malnutrition et de la mortalité maternelle/infantile. Cette approche sera soutenue à travers son intégration graduelle dans les plans stratégiques du Ministère de la santé, du MASEF, du Ministère de la jeunesse et de Taazour visant à terme à assurer son financement par des ressources nationales pour sa mise à l’échelle.  La qualité de la prise en charge de la MAS s'étant améliorée, il est important d’appuyer le fonctionnement de l’ensemble des USB et de maintenir un appui des ONG avec un objectif de renforcement de capacités du système de santé régulièrement évalué.
La mise en œuvre conjointe et intégrée du traitement/prévention de la malnutrition avec une meilleure couverture et qualité a été rendue possible grâce à la redynamisation de la coordination multisectorielle ; le développement d’un plan d’appui UN au Gouvernement pour le renforcement de la nutrition ; le partenariat avec 14 ONG (9 nationales/5 internationales) et le PAM et le renforcement des synergies avec l’action de la Banque mondiale (projet INAYA).
Malgré des avancées en termes de couverture, le nombre d’enfants en dehors de l’école reste très inquiétant, demandant des efforts soutenus par l’ensemble des acteurs. Des approches innovantes sont nécessaires pour répondre à la crise profonde de l’enseignement. L’expérience de la plateforme digitale d’enseignement du français à distance « AKELIUS », porte d’entrée vers des alternatives éducatives pour les enfants et les adolescents, se poursuivra en 2022 avec l’extension de son utilisation pour l’enseignement à distance et son arrimage à la plateforme du ministère. Des avancées sont notées dans le dialogue politique sur l’éducation non-formelles à travers la collaboration avec le Ministère de l’enseignement originel, et les partenaires pour : (i) le recensement et la classification des Mahadras, (ii) l'instauration d'un cahier de charges comportant les conditions minimales d'ouverture et d'exercice d’une Mahadra (iii) la mise en place d'un système de qualification des Mahadras, (iv) le renforcement de l'encadrement et du contrôle. Une approche pilote menée en synergie avec les acteurs de la Protection, auprès 22 Mahadras à Nouakchott est expérimentée en vue de formaliser ces Mahadras modèles et d’améliorer les conditions d’apprentissage des apprenants et générer des évidences. 
Le Centre SAFIA, fruit d’un travail collaboratif intersectoriel visant l’autonomisation et la participation active à la vie publique des jeunes filles ainsi que le renforcement de leurs compétences et employabilité, est devenu un espace incontournable de la commune de Dar Naim à Nouakchott. Ce projet bénéficie du financement de l’initiative « Innover pour émanciper les filles et les femmes par l’éducation », adoptée lors de la Conférence du G7 (Paris, juillet 2019), qui permet aux partenaires privés de s’engager aux côtés de l’UNICEF et de démultiplier l’impact de leur don à travers un accord de doublement des fonds mobilisés appuyé par la France. Les 1400 filles qui fréquentent le centre sont encadrées par des coachs en développement personnel issus de la communauté. Elles acquièrent des compétences et échangent leurs problèmes et solutions, tout en bénéficiant d’une permanence médicale, grâce à laquelle le centre bénéficie du label « Safe Space ».
L’autonomisation du secteur, la planification par objectif et le suivi-évaluation sont les défis majeurs du programme WASH. L’absence d’une stratégie post F-DAL consolidée est une contrainte sur laquelle l’UNICEF devra travailler en 2022. L’approche intersectorielle, coordonnée des interventions en zone périurbaine (politiques sociales, C4D) a été clé pour cibler les interventions WASH pour les ménages vulnérables. Dans le cadre de l’adaptation au changement climatique, des approches innovantes sont développées sur l’eau (dessalement solaire, infrastructures, systèmes AEP, postes/pompage d’eau solaires) et testées notamment sur le renforcement de la maitrise d’ouvrage communale et l’implication des jeunes promoteurs dans l’assainissement en zone péri-urbaine.
Le renforcement des systèmes de protection de l’enfant au niveau de 13 communes, la délocalisation des interventions de prévention et de réponse aux violences faites aux enfants, filles et garçons, au niveau des villages par l’intégration de la Protection de l’enfant dans les écoles (Education) et les GASPA (Nutrition), initiée en 2021, permettra de compter sur des ressources humaines formées qui contribueront à une plus grande identification et prise en charge des enfants victimes de violences vivant dans les localités où manquent les services de protection. 
L’intersectorialité Santé/Nutrition/Education/Protection/Protection Sociale sera renforcé en 2022 pour la prévention universelle des violences à l’égard des enfants (plan stratégique Protection 2021-2030).
Le bureau a démarré un processus d’élaboration d’une feuille de route et d’un plan d’actions pour renforcer les capacités de l’UNICEF et du Gouvernement en matière de Finances Publiques pour les Enfants (PF4C). A la suite de l’identification en 2021, des priorités des ministères sociaux relatives aux réformes en cours dans le domaine des finances publiques, les prochaines étapes en 2022 sont notamment l’analyse des goulots d’étranglement, la définition des axes prioritaires et le développement des partenariats stratégiques pour accélérer l’atteinte des résultats clés pour les enfants.
Dans le cadre du programme Renforcer la résilience au Sahel mis en œuvre conjointement avec le PAM, la définition des deux modèles d’intervention (école résilience et nutrition) sera finalisée et leur mise en œuvre concrétisée dans des sites résilience. Le bureau a produit un modèle d’approche communautaire participative intégrée (ACPI) qui favorise l’appropriation et la durabilité des résultats de développement qui sera expérimenté en 2022 avant un passage à l’échelle 2023. La modélisation des ACPI devrait être une composante forte de la nouvelle stratégie nationale C4D-SBC.
Les travaux analytiques en cours, le bilan des réalisations et les leçons apprises de la mise en œuvre du programme 2018-2022 informeront le processus de développement du prochain programme pays, UNSCDF (2023-2027)."
WCAR,Niger,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Pour atteindre les enfants les plus vulnérables, l’UNICEF fait face à des défis majeurs tels que la démographie et à l’accès aux populations dans les zones d’insécurité. En effet le Niger présente la croissance démographique (3,8%) la plus élevée au monde. Les efforts du pays pour avancer les indicateurs sociaux sont démontrés en chiffres absolu et toujours plus positifs, mais les ratios se heurtent aux besoins sociaux toujours plus importants. De plus, les tensions électorales et le délai causé par la mise en place des nouvelles autorités a aussi retardé la réponse humanitaire et le programme régulier. 
L'accès aux populations affectées est resté le principal défi en raison de l'insécurité, des restrictions gouvernementales et de l'imposition d'escortes armées. Les populations déplacées par les conflits ou vivant dans des zones insécurisées ne reçoivent pas les services essentiels dont elles ont besoin et elles n’ont pas accès à des mesures de protection sociale. Ces multiples chocs accentuent la vulnérabilité générée par les impacts socio-économiques de la crise COVID-19 et testent chaque année les capacités de coordination du gouvernement et de ses partenaires. Face aux chocs (2.5 chocs en moyenne sur les trois dernières années), la majorité des ménages font recours à des stratégies d’adaptation négatives avec des effets défavorables pour leur bien-être et celui de leurs enfants (ECVMA 2019).
En 2021, le manque de données fiables a motivé l’UNICEF à investir dans les questions de redevabilité, de contrôle citoyen et de prise en compte des risques. La mise en œuvre de l’outil « Open Data Kit » dans la gestion logistique du nouveau vaccin Polio pendant la riposte vaccinale a permis la remontée des données de tous les centres de santé avec une promptitude de 90% en 24 heures permettant ainsi des prises de décisions en temps réel. Cette expérience a ouvert la voie à une révision du facteur de perte de 1.67 à 1.25 dans les pays qui utiliseront pour la première fois le nouveau vaccin Polio. Dans le domaine de la santé, l’UNICEF donnera la priorité sur l’atteinte des enfants en zones d’accès difficile avec leur géolocalisation dans le but d’un meilleur suivi, le plaidoyer pour une allocation suffisante de la ligne « achat des vaccins » du gouvernement et à l’amélioration de la qualité des données pour la prise de décision.
Face à la crise de sécurité alimentaire prévue en 2022, et en cohérence avec le plan de réponse du gouvernement, l’UNICEF poursuit la mobilisation des fonds pour éviter une interruption de services pour la prise en charge de la malnutrition aiguë sévère et les contributions potentielles en protection sociale et en EHA sont en exploration. Un focus particulier est mis sur le renforcement du nexus humanitaire/développement afin d’adresser les problèmes structurels profonds par des investissements plus importants pour la prévention de la malnutrition à moyen et long terme.
En 2021, la pandémie et les crises devenues structurelles ont aussi constitué une opportunité pour une prise de conscience collective des acteurs sur la nécessité d’adresser la crise des apprentissages à travers des actions de remédiation et de relance pédagogique ainsi que la promotion du numérique. Dans le domaine de l’éducation, le renforcement des données à travers les initiatives GIGA et Data Must Speak ont permis une géolocalisation de 103 écoles et fourni les données clés pour guider la prise de décision pour le secteur. 
Le RapidPro s’est également avéré un outil essentiel dans la planification et le suivi de la réponse humanitaire. En 2021, un total de 15 336 rapports quotidiens (61,5%) de cas potentiels de paludisme et de choléra sur les 24 900 rapports attendus ont été collectés. En outre, 4 076 rapports de surveillance communautaire (71%) sur les 5 750 rapports attendus ont été reçus sur l’épidémie de COVID-19. Les données collectées ont aidé le Ministère de la Santé Publique et ses partenaires dans la réponse à l'épidémie principalement pour la gestion des cas et des stocks. Durant ce dernier trimestre de l'année, RapidPro a atteint un record d'alertes sanitaires pour le Ministère de la Santé Publique de la région de Niamey. 
L’UNICEF a lancé le processus de mise en place d'une approche communautaire participative et centrée sur l’humain intégrant comme acteurs majeurs les communautés dans le déploiement des interventions et bâtissant sur les capacités endogènes. L’approche de l’éducation par les mères, leaders communautaires, religieux, et jeunes s’est montrée plus effective dans la dissémination d’information que par des professionnels ou autres agents dans la promotion des bonnes pratiques auprès des communautés. De même, l’implication des leaders traditionnels et des leaders religieux a eu plus d'influence sur l’adoption des pratiques par les communautés que la promotion faite à travers les media et services techniques. La génération des évidences (recherches, enquêtes, suivi, supervision et évaluations) relatives au changement social et comportemental a également contribué au renforcement de la planification basée sur des évidences dans plusieurs domaines.  
L'autonomisation et le renforcement des capacités d’influence des jeunes, y compris les jeunes non scolarisés, auprès des leaders a constitué un catalyseur pour le lancement d’initiatives globales (GenU Sahel). Cependant, le déficit de cadres de dialogue formels et réguliers entre les autorités locales et les groupes habituellement exclus (jeunes non organisés en milieu rural, femmes, groupes minoritaires, personnes handicapées et à besoins spécifiques, populations mobiles, populations déplacées, groupes à ascendance esclave) dans les instances de gouvernance reste un défi à part entière.
Malgré les progrès au niveau national, il a été constaté une faible coordination des interventions en faveur des jeunes dans le processus de planification, mise en œuvre, suivi et évaluation des interventions au niveau des communes. Une démarche a été initiée pour une meilleure implication des jeunes pour favoriser l’opérationnalité d’un cadre communal de concertation et de coordination des actions pour et avec les jeunes. Les différentes actions d’appui aux mouvements de jeunesse ont créé une augmentation de la demande d’appui technique et financier pour participer dans le développement, d’où la nécessité de la mise en place mécanisme de soutien et d’accompagnement au niveau du gouvernement en 2022.

"
WCAR,Nigeria,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In 2021, there were important lessons learned cutting across programmes, which will inform shifts in how we accelerate progress to deliver results for children in the future. These focused on shifting strategies to achieve more with less, driving the social behaviour change agenda, including gender norms, strengthening the response to outbreaks, innovative COVID-19 programming, and ramping up field monitoring.
 
Achieving more with less
Across programmes, a powerful lesson learned is that emphasizing prevention (Nutrition), sustainability (WASH), and shifting focus from coverage to targeting the most vulnerable (Health) will help UNICEF achieve more with less. 
 
In Nutrition, prevention is the least funded and attended to both internally and externally but the best buy. It costs US€10 to provide the complete package of preventive interventions during the 1,000 days window, whereas it costs US$120 to manage and treat a child with severe acute malnutrition (SAM). Therefore, UNICEF will focus both human and financial resources on prevention, by investing in generating evidence to diagnose issues, identify solutions, and unlock barriers from financing to service delivery. 
 
This year, focusing on sustaining WASH services rather than building new facilities proved cost-effective. UNICEF also learned that empowering communities to control and operate their water facilities makes them more willing to maintain and repair. UNICEF is encouraging statewide adoption of the revised Village Level Operation and Maintenance strategy, which is now community-owned and profit-oriented. So far, 12 states have adopted it, with more expected to come on board.
 
Since 2020, the health system in Nigeria has faced significant stressors (polio outbreak, COVID-19, cholera outbreak). Although there is increased political will and consensus around the health systems strengthening (HSS) agenda, it is not translating to progress in reaching those most vulnerable—children receiving no vaccinations (“zero-dose”). This year, UNICEF intensified routine immunization efforts in 90 zero-dose LGAs, and in the future, will explore the use of GIS mapping to locate even more hard-to-reach communities. 
 
UNICEF has learned that using a multisectoral approach to target these zero-dose communities with essential integrated primary health care (PHC) services (acting as a one-stop PHC for maternal health, immunization, and nutrition) will potentially yield better results.
 
Driving the social behaviour change agenda
This year highlighted the need to generate multisectoral evidence and collect qualitative formative data to address barriers to socio-cultural and gender norms, financing, and promoting attitudes and practices to reduce the high prevalence of violence against children. A gender program review of the program and a gender snapshot analysis of relevant indicators was completed. UNICEF will invest in the most impactful and realistic priorities, shifting from Communication for Development (C4D) to social and behaviour change communication (SBC). 
 
UNICEF is developing an SBC strategy to strengthen community engagement and promote behaviour change, especially with regards to:
•               focus on first 1000 days - priority sectors are WASH, Nutrition, CP, and Education
•               improving uptake of COVID-19 and polio vaccines 
•               promoting positive masculinity in boys, empowerment of adolescent girls and adolescent parenting
•               boosting demand for birth registration services and ending FGM
•               addressing gender drivers for school dropouts and uptake of health care and WASH services
Additionally, UNICEF will map and strengthen community engagement platforms to address behaviour change initiatives holistically. This year, recruiting young U-Reporters as vaccine champions was an innovative strategy, and UNICEF will engage more young people and explore different digital platforms for SBC.
 
Strengthening response to outbreaks
Poor sector coordination affected the preparedness and response to the widespread cholera outbreak in the country in 2021 which resulted in at least 3,600 fatalities. UNICEF is taking measures to improve sector coordination, strengthen emergency preparedness and response and build the capacity of stakeholders to manage WASH-related public health emergencies like cholera. This will begin with cholera preparedness training in the first quarter of 2022 and a robust emergency preparedness mechanism.
 
In health, although funding diminished after the polio-free status and a major cVPPV2 outbreak followed, the consensus on the way forward is to respond based on granular data, integrate community structures, and boost polio routine immunization targeting LGAs with existing outbreaks.
 
Innovative COVID-19 programming
Across programmes, UNICEF has leveraged opportunities from the COVID-19 pandemic to improve service delivery and accelerate results for children:
•          Health: Although the COVID-19 pandemic affected routine immunization services, it provided an opportunity to strengthen the system, including cold chain storage capacity and oxygen supply systems. Supplemental immunization activities, including COVID-19 vaccination, will be integrated with routine services to maximize resource utilization and reduce missed opportunities.
•          Child Protection: The COVID-19 crisis facing Almajiri children – children sent away to Islamic schools – led to UNICEF developing a programme for children in street situations, including adolescent girls, to access formal education, life skills, and social protection schemes to be rolled out in 2022.
•          Education: A key lesson learned was diversifying learning opportunities for children in Nigeria in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent learning losses. UNICEF deployed several remote learning options, including low (radio and community-based learning) and high-tech digital learning solutions (Nigeria Learning Passport), to ensure continuity of education reaching at least 1,426,762 children.
 
Field monitoring
This year, UNICEF invested in developing a monitoring framework to strengthen field office governance, results’ planning, and monitoring. The aim is to delineate accountability and responsibilities across levels and support field offices to focus on monitoring activities contextually.
 
UNICEF piloted the monitoring system and accompanying tools in some field offices, utilised lessons learned to refine the process, and will scale this up countrywide in 2022. The new monitoring framework guides the planning of activities in the context of the field office. It enables course corrections to improve performance and support program delivery.
 
In 2022, UNICEF will expand on several emerging innovations that have the potential to make a difference in the lives of children and young people in Nigeria: digital birth registration, the Child-Friendly Communities Initiative, the Primary Health Care Leadership Challenge Fund, and Generation Unlimited, fostering public-private partnerships to empower young people with education (Learning Passport), skills training (YOMA), employment, entrepreneurship, and empowerment.

WCAR,Republic of Cameroon,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF interventions were implemented in a challenging environment marked by two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic and multi-sectoral impacts of the pandemic on people’s lives and livelihoods. Successes achieved and constraints faced enabled UNICEF to learn important lessons for the new cooperation cycle. 
Lesson 1. Interventions delivered to children at decentralized level are still highly dependant on resources from external donors. Combined with limited allocation of public resources to social sector ministries, this does not secure sustainability and limits scaling-up of Country Programme achievements. To address this, UNICEF implemented several actions: (i) advocacy to decentralized authorities on the importance of nutrition and the high stakes for development; (ii) technical support for the creation of a mayors’ platform on nutrition; (iii) support for designation of a mayor as local champion and key influencer of peers; (iv) advocacy to the Special Council Support Fund for Mutual Assistance (FEICOM) to leverage resources for mayors who agreed to allocate 1 per cent of their council’s annual budget to nutrition interventions; (v) support for the creation of the mayors and parliamentarians networks for nutrition. Together these actions have helped mobilize US$ 1 million for 33 councils in East region. From this initiative, UNICEF learnt that when local decision-makers access the right information, they understand what is at stake, they come together in networks and influence allocation of domestic resources. To replicate this approach to other sectors, there is a need to build on robust evidence, map stakeholders, engage in one-to-one dialogue, identify champions, gather all possible influencers, and build strong functional partnerships at all relevant decision-making levels.
Lesson 2. Humanitarian needs in Cameroon exist along a continuum from immediate to protracted needs. This requires an adaptive humanitarian response that is well-prepared and agile. There were 72 ‘lockdown days’ in the North-West and South-West regions in 2021, preventing access to populations in need. To address these challenges UNICEF pursued a Child Risk Impact Analysis to inform programming, which was finalized in December 2021 with broad stakeholder consultation (including with 7,000+ U-reporters). UNICEF also championed the localization agenda with UN OCHA to enhance the capacity of local organizations (recommendations to be rolled out in 2022) to reach inaccessible communities. With the implementation of these solutions, UNICEF together with other United Nations agencies have the knowledge to address key emergency challenges in the field in North-West and South-West regions in line with the Core Commitments for Children. From this initiative, UNICEF learnt: (1) Early planning and early identification of partners are critical to a quick response to humanitarian needs. The preparation of contingency and long-term standby agreements should be pursued through a structured process that includes early issue of calls for Expression of Interest and the use of the United Nations Partnership Portal. Emergency Preparedness needs improvement, informed by Risk Analysis, and the capacity of partners (including UNICEF) to respond requires strengthening; (2) Build a strong network of local organizations and seize the opportunities for international NGOs to transfer their competencies to local NGOs; (3) Adapt UNICEF internal procedures to fit into the needs of community-based organizations and local NGOs; (4) Overall knowledge and skills of programme and operational staff to lead and support the development of Programme Documents and Humanitarian Programme Documents must be strengthened.
Lesson 3. The UNICEF – UNHCR Blueprint initiative enables optimization of interventions in the field through harmonization of strategies and complementary mandates. This initiative was constrained by: (1) difficulties in mobilizing additional resources to support implementation of the Joint Action Plan; (2) existing differences in partnership management between both agencies, which prevented a reduction in operational costs; (3) existence of separate monitoring frameworks (Regular programme/Blueprint). To address these challenges, the two agencies agreed to recruit for a dedicated position to manage Blueprint implementation. In addition, a joint field monitoring visit with the government was conducted to ensure that Local Council Development Plans integrate Blueprint interventions. As a result, Manjou and Garoua-Boulai councils in East region benefited from Blueprint packages. Lessons learned: (1) joint action with sister agencies strengthens United Nations credibility; (2) integration of Blueprint interventions in Local Council Development Plans guaranteed ownership and sustainability of the interventions; (3) by improving access to basic social services, Blueprint interventions reinforce social cohesion and peaceful cohabitation between refugees and host communities. Blueprint values integration between programme sectors and agencies and is a model for facilitating resource mobilization, as successfully demonstrated for “Education cannot wait” in the East and Far North regions."
WCAR,Sao Tome & Principe,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Evidence-based Advocacy: 
    
Evidence has demonstrated to be key for effective advocacy and strategic planning. In 2020, UNICEF supported government to conduct an Epidemiological Study of HIV Transmission which findings were used in 2021 to update policies and guidelines on mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT). The update of the guidelines, based on reliable evidence, lead to improved and harmonized processes which contributed to achieve the milestone of 0 vertical transmission in 2021. Based on this success and considering the challenges faced to successfully advocate for the update the National Child Protection Policy and its Action Plan 2016-2017, UNICEF STP, with HQ support, conducted a Secondary Analysis of MICS6 on child protection. The results will be used in 2022 as advocacy entry points to encourage an analytical revision of the outdated national action plan for child protection and to inform programming and strategic directions in the new UNICEF Country Programme.

The country felt short from achieving results in Ending Open Defecation (ODF) and Nutrition. In relation to ODF, regardless of UNICEF investments on community-led total sanitation program approach (CLTS), adherence has been weak and only two more communities were declared ODF in 2021. To have better understanding of the root causes and find adequate solutions, UNICEF will implement a Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices Study on VAC and ODF as well as a SBCC strategy as previously mentioned. Development of Budget and Policy Brief for both, WASH and VAC will lead to enhanced evidence-based advocacy to influence effective interventions and funds allocations in these areas.    

Systems strengthening to leave no one behind: 
    
Results on cold chain improvement and vaccine co-financing commitments can be partially attributed to UNICEF focus on having a clear and realistic costed plan for immunization and adequate capacity building of health staff.  Leveraging on these good practices and to achieve the 100% DTP-Hib-Heb3 coverage while ensuring compliance of the vaccine schedule (Percentage of children 12-23 months fully immunized decreased from 66% in 2019 to 41.5% in 2021), UNICEF will invest on evidence-based planning, using routine information systems (DHIS2) to identify where the most vulnerable are and ensuring that limited budget is strategically allocated to implement effective interventions. This approach will be also applied in Child Protection in relation to Birth Registration interventions using administrative data to identify where the 1,6% of children not registered are.

On this regard, UNICEF STP is advocating and providing technical support to strengthen and foster the regular update and analysis of administrative data, as key source of information that can be readily accessed and used to complement large-scale surveys. In 2021, the case management to respond to children victim of violence, haven’t succeed in creating an operational multi-sectorial referral system. One of the causes is the lack of coordination among sectors at the district and central level, due to the lack of integrated information systems. In 2022, UNICEF will focus to foster a multisectoral utilization of administrative data, with a focus on VAC. Ensuring that information retrieved from cases that were identified, reported, registered, and handled by authorities, or by service providers from different sectors is properly integrated, UNICEF and counterparts will understand whether services are effectively delivered, where the constraints are and plan adequate solutions. As such, UNICEF will continue its support to ensure VAC data regularity, completeness, and reliability across sectors, as well as promoting its use to influence programme planning and budget allocations . 
Constraints have been identified in the area of nutrition due to limited human resources capacity, lack of funding and absence of partnerships. Considering the structural lack of capacities, a more integrated approach centered on child survival and development with the potential to integrate nutrition into health and into education programmes, could address these constraints. 

The relevance of innovation and digital technology to increase learning opportunities for all:
    
With COVID-19, the fragilities of the education sector (poor infrastructure, overcrowded classrooms and inadequate pedagogical content and low learning outcomes, especially among the poorest) have been exacerbated and those more vulnerable have been negatively more affected. This has provided an opportunity to rethink strategies that can make the system more resilient, which is key, given the country context. UNICEF is supporting the Government to define the national strategy for the development of the Digital Learning Program through a pilot intervention in the island of Principe. In this regard, UNICEF has been developing strategic partnerships to implement the pilot that will introduce the Learning Passport as a national digital learning platform and will include a comprehensive blended/hybrid teaching approach, combining traditional face-to-face teaching and digital tools accessible to both children and teachers. 

Leveraging on the important investment UNICEF did in providing IT equipment and improving internet connectivity within social protection in 2021, UNICEF supported social protection to deliver online trainings for social workers as alternative to the in-presence trainings. However, the social workers engagement in such trainings hasn’t been high and the expected training objectives were not met. Among the identified challenges, was the limited digital literacy and outdated training methodology among the social workers and the social protections experts. In 2022, UNICEF STP with support of Mozambique Country Office, will implement a 100-hour blended remote training for case management and psychosocial support. The blended modality offers social workers the opportunity to reach mentors and peers to clarify doubts and exchange knowledge on daily work experiences at any time. Before the training, the participants will receive an introductory course on how to use the eLearning platform and how to obtain informatic support when needed. Mentors will be identified in country (Government, partners and UNICEF specialists in child protection case management) to support the learning process, monitor case management in practice and respond doubts.
"
WCAR,Senegal,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Use of COVID-19 response as an entry point for systems strengthening 
Senegal has a strong track record in enabling access to oxygen in primary health care facilities through the innovative SPRINT initiative. Early lessons from its implementation have laid the groundwork for a large-scale deployment of oxygen equipment for the COVID-19 response and strengthened maternal and newborn care delivery. The preliminary data shows that SPRINT increased communities’ trust in the quality of care and resulted in a higher demand for services. The whole health system was thus strengthened as many patients with COVID-19, pneumonia, and other illnesses were treated in health posts, with only severe cases referred to higher-level health facilities. This public-private partnership will be further scaled up in 2022, with increased investment and ownership by the government.
 
Efforts in addressing the pandemic’s impact on education have diverted attention and resources away from initiatives benefiting pre-existing out-of-school children
Significant government efforts were geared towards safe school reopening, keeping vulnerable pupils in school, and learning loss catch-up. However, due to resource constraints, the government delayed responses to the largely unmet learning needs of pre-existing out-of-school children. UNICEF, World Bank, USAID, and the Canadian government partnered to counter-balance this trend by supporting reinsertion models and alternative education strategies while advocating for the government’s increased attention. UNICEF will also continue to accelerate learning interventions for out-of-school children and adolescents based on a planned programme evaluation, which will inform the achievement of key results for children in education for the remainder of the country programme.  
 
Stronger national leadership is essential in tackling social norms for the protection of children against violence and harmful practices
For the past decade, civil society organizations and frontline workers have been at the forefront of grassroots engagement to change existing beliefs, attitudes, and behaviour around the prevention of violence against children and gender-based harmful practices. Efforts to increasingly engage with political and institutional actors have, however, proven critical to influence public opinion, accelerate law reform and enforcement, and stimulate and sustain change in social norms. Joining forces with partners, different faith-based opinion leaders, media professionals, and women and youth organization representatives has enabled UNICEF to successfully engage in consensus building and political engagement to implement ambitious national communication campaigns on violence and harmful practices. This positive development, coupled with enhanced capacity development investments in community social work, will be pursued to accelerate the achievement of key results in child protection, in particular prevention and response to sexual violence. 
 
Enhanced duty of care
One of the most important lessons learned in 2021 was the need to continuously focus on staff wellbeing through the different waves of the pandemic, in order to best pursue the achievement of key results for children. Highly flexible working arrangements and the investment in numerous wellbeing initiatives – in particular for colleagues in the Kolda sub-office – helped reduce stress and burn-out. The emergence and embracement of the ‘new normal’ of remote and hybrid working was also critical during peak pandemic periods. Acknowledging the key influence of managers on staff morale and a positive office culture, and based on an external diagnostic of staff wellbeing complementing the most recent Global Staff Survey, UNICEF Senegal rolled out an ‘appreciative inquiry’ approach to team and individual coaching, focusing on a strengths-based and positive outlook to leadership development and organizational change. This office-wide initiative was complemented by actions prioritizing professional development, with close to 30% of staff benefiting from stretch assignments and promotions in the past two years. The office will continue to prioritize advancement opportunities for all staff, especially in the General Services category, and initiatives to increase psychological safety, respect of UNICEF core values and standards of conduct, gender equality and women’s empowerment. 
 
Innovations with, and for, young people 
The engagement of young people as actors of social and gender normative change was strengthened through innovative youth participation approaches in the UNICEF mid-term review. UNICEF staff engaged directly with young people to co-create interventions and solutions to emerging issues such as gender-transformation, climate action, and mental health. The outcomes of this process are helping to accelerate the achievement of key results for children for the last two years of the country programme. 
 
The Youth Consortium of Senegal – the Senegal Chapter of Generation Unlimited championed by UNICEF – was recognized as an innovative and strategic youth-led public-private partnership by global Generation Unlimited partners. Its composition of youth-led, non-governmental, and private sector organizations, with the involvement of government institutions and development partners, is inspiring other countries engaged in initiatives benefiting young people’s access to learning and employment opportunities. 
 
Young people have also been involved as partners in programmes designed to fight violence against children, end FGM and child marriage, and produce WASH-related product innovation linked to entrepreneurship and employment. For the remainder of the country programme, the engagement of adolescents and young people will be further institutionalized in all thematic areas as a major strategy for the country programme.  
 
Innovations in decentralized planning and programming
UNICEF started implementing a programmatic convergence approach articulated on priority key results for children in regions with the highest levels of child poverty and vulnerability. It is based on a new way of approaching multisectoral operational planning by targeting communities and authorities already benefiting from the UNICEF’s supported Child Friendly Municipalities initiative. These communities offer an entry point for accelerating the decentralized delivery of a package of services for children. The approach provides an opportunity to design, plan, and implement innovative, locally-appropriate, and locally-supported interventions for children and adolescents by communities, local elected officials, technical services, and children and adolescents themselves. 
 
The above encapsulates how programmes can be adapted, scaled-up or re-envisioned in 2022 and 2023 to accelerate results for children. Recommendations from the 2021 country programme mid-term review will be used to immediately adjust programme interventions for the remainder of the current country programme and will also inform the next country programme 2024–2028 preparations.
"
WCAR,Sierra Leone,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Considering the strategies deployed to drive programme implementation and achieve results in 2021, several lessons were learned. 
UNICEF adopted a different approach to training partners in 2021. With the increase of online trainings, UNICEF deployed its quality assurance team to conduct a cascade of trainings in the most hard-to-reach districts of the country over the course of three weeks. Thus, instead of the pre-COVID-19 approach under which only one or two focal persons from IPs attended training events, entire teams were able to receive pertinent information on ethics, risk, fraud, and financial SOPs and directly ask questions. Importantly, the quality assurance team was able to give on-the-ground guidance to IPs on how to improve their systems to strengthen risk management. This new approach facilitated a compilation of recommendations and best practices that have been shared with partners for guidance and reference purposes.
A UNICEF-supported bottleneck analysis of health and nutrition services and practices was undertaken within the framework of Appreciative Inquiry and a Caring for the Caregiver (CFC) pilot implemented in 2021. This revealed that in addition to the well-known physical, social, and financial access barriers, there are psychological barriers associated with patriarchal and other power structures which drive perpetuation and reinforcement of gender norms that discriminate against women and girls. This calls for gender transformative programming directed at root causes, including proactive mental health support for marginalized people, and use of innovative approaches, technology-based solutions to break through psychological and social barriers and norms.
A summative evaluation conducted on the WASH initiative ‘Accelerating Sanitation and Water for All Programme, Sierra Leone (ASWA-SL)’ with support of UNICEF Regional Office for West and Central Africa, captured lessons to inform future WASH programmes.

It was noted that there is a need for better understanding of behaviour change dynamics and barriers faced by the most vulnerable population, particularly persons with disabilities, in accessing WASH services. Secondly there is a need to work with them and their communities to find constructive ways to eliminate these barriers.

Another important lesson learned was that achieving sustainable benefits in health and living standards requires combining programming on access to safe water with sanitation, hygiene practices, and behavioural change in line with SDG6. The evaluation report recommended focusing on communities in a more comprehensive synergistic approach ensuring that a target community receives all three WASH components (water, sanitation, and hygiene) rather than attempting to reach a maximum number of communities with only partial services.
UNICEF underwent an internal audit of its CPC with GoSL during the reporting year. Based on the findings, recommendations were agreed for follow up by the office. In 2022, the office will continue to follow up on the recommendations to streamline various processes including for selection of IPs and the use of UNICEF’s tools for tracking quality assurance activities, which are essential in ensuring effective and robust programming.
Innovations
Given the restrictions that were in place on travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF experimented with its donor visit modality from in-person visits to virtual tours. This was done through a combination of videos of a project and discussions with the end recipients and with UNICEF staff. This, for instance, provided an opportunity for the Swedish National Committee for UNICEF to view work and challenges in Sierra Leone. This modality has been found to be cost-effective, participatory and will be increasingly offered as an option for future donor visits.
As a response to the global learning crisis exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the widening learning gap, UNICEF has scaled up the face to face UPSHIFT model through digitization of the UPSHIFT curriculum. The digitized approach facilitates scaling up informal learning opportunities for adolescents in Sierra Leone thereby contributing to the GoSL’s strategic priority on building human capacity at all levels.
Leveraging Resources and Looking Forward
 UNICEF Sierra Leone is increasingly leveraging investments under specific initiatives to achieve results in one or more other areas with funding challenges or to take programming and results to scale. To this end, this report has already shown how the network of health workers across Sierra Leone is being leveraged to expand birth registration. In some cases, such leveraging is only just being tapped into. This is the case with the Reimagine Education initiative to address the learning crisis demonstrated by the fact that millions of children and young people are not developing the skills they need to break out of poverty. The initiative is reimagining education as an enterprise to build not just reading, writing, and mathematics skills but also skills in problem-solving, creativity, and critical thinking that young people need for work, to start a business, and to engage productively in their communities. Another opportunity is provided through the GIGA programme aimed at connecting every school to the internet and thus expanding options for reimagining education in Sierra Leone. 
Thirty-five UNICEF staff were trained on Business for Results and the office engaged business leaders who responded positively to UNICEF’s initiative to create a business forum on child rights in Sierra Leone. This is a huge opportunity for greater sustainable progress on child rights, not only through direct private sector and business support for UNICEF’s work but also indirectly with businesses and private sector operators embedding child rights standards and considerations into their work.
The above lessons learned and their implications for programme strategy adjustments, along with emerging opportunities especially regarding leveraging and use of innovations as discussed above, will boost results starting in 2022 when they will be integrated into the new biennial GoSL-UNICEF Rolling Workplans for 2022-2023. The CPC’s approach to WASH, for example, based on lessons learned from the WASH evaluation discussed above, will transition to a strategy under which communities receive all three WASH components (water, sanitation, and hygiene) as opposed to single interventions to drive more sustainable results in WASH. GoSL’s mid-term review of its MTNDP and the UNICEF-supported Strategic Moment of Reflection scheduled for 2022 will contribute additional lessons that will help shape the next CPC (2024–2028)."
WCAR,Togo,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Leçon apprise : Accélération vaccinale et interopérabilité des services de santé et état civil 
 
La recherche action sur l’accélération vaccinale et l’enregistrement des naissances a été conduite par l’Université de Lomé, le Ministère de la Santé et l’UNICEF en 2021. Elle a prouvé que la recherche active des enfants difficiles à atteindre maintient, voire augmente dans certaines régions, la couverture en vaccination et en soins maternel et infantile. Il a été démontré aussi que l’interopérabilité entre les services de santé et les services d’état civil constitue une solution idoine pour identifier et rattraper les enfants les plus vulnérables. 
 
La pandémie de COVID-19 a eu un impact négatif sur l’accès aux différents services sociaux de base, notamment une baisse de la couverture vaccinale et de l’utilisation des services de santé maternelle et infantile.   
 
Pour renforcer le plaidoyer auprès des différents acteurs, il a été jugé nécessaire de disposer d’évidences pour mieux comprendre les mécanismes et les dysfonctionnements en cause et identifier les solutions devant permettre la réduction des disparités dans l’accès des enfants aux services de santé et à l’enregistrement des naissances. 
 
Au total 2.394 parents/tuteurs et 2.273 enfants de 12 à 59 mois ont été enquêtés. En 2021, la couverture vaccinale complète chez les enfants au Togo en 2021 était estimée à 75 pour cent. Elle était plus élevée dans les régions de la Kara et des Savanes avec une même couverture estimée à 83 pour cent. La région Grand Lomé présentait la plus faible couverture avec une proportion de 64 pour cent. Un des points forts de ces initiatives a été l’instauration d’un dialogue stratégique entre les Ministres de l’Administration territoriale, de la Santé et de l’Action Sociale pour une institutionnalisation de l’approche multisectorielle sur la base des évidences observées et partagées aux membres du gouvernement. 
 
Bien que le Togo ait un taux d’enregistrement de naissance d’environ 80 pour cent, des disparités régionales ont été observées et des actions sont nécessaires pour atteindre la couverture universelle, notamment les enfants les plus vulnérables. Le délai de 45 jours n’est généralement pas respecté par les plus démunis qui ont alors besoin d’un jugement supplétif, source de frais supplémentaires.  
 
Concernant l’interopérabilité entre les services de santé et les centres d’état civil, globalement, en 2021, 89 pour cent des centres d’état civil se situent à moins de 5 kms d’une formation sanitaire (FOSA), contre 49,5 pour cent en 2012. Par ailleurs, près de quatre FOSA sur cinq (81,5 pour cent) ne disposent pas d’un centre d’Etat civil en leur sein. L’extension des services d’état civil au sein des FOSA serait un atout pour ne laisser aucun enfant de côté et leur assurer ce droit fondamental.  
 
L’interopérabilité permet de rattraper tous les enfants en utilisant comme porte d’entrée les services de santé (accouchement, vaccination) et en évitant les silos internes dans les secteurs clés. Cette expérience a permis de mobiliser de nouveaux partenaires, facteur favorable à un passage à échelle.
 
Leçon apprise : Contribution à la lutte contre toutes formes de violences faites aux enfants, cas de la justice juvénile
 
L’évaluation indépendante du projet « Amélioration de l’Accès à la justice pour les enfants au Togo » coordonnée par le Ministère de la Justice, en collaboration avec l’UE et l’UNICEF a montré que les services de protection conviviaux de proximité préservent la dignité des enfants. Ces services multisectoriels ont été essentiels pour garantir la protection des droits des enfants en contact avec la loi y compris la réinsertion familiale. 
 
Les approches centrées sur l’individualité de chaque enfant avec la participation communautaire, combinées avec l’utilisation des services juridiques de proximité ont permis d’améliorer la performance dans la gestion des cas depuis 2019.  
 
La non-activation du décret sur l'assistance juridique demeure un défi et implique que les enfants en contact avec le système judiciaire ne reçoivent pas d'assistance juridique dans les délais et selon les standards requis; sauf pour les cas où l’enfant est accompagné par un avocat et sa famille.
 
L’analyse a souligné que le renforcement de l’approche systémique dans la justice juvénile a favorisé le changement de paradigme dans le processus de traitement des dossiers des enfants. Cette approche se fonde sur trois piliers: (i) l’amélioration du cadre légal et stratégique; (ii) le renforcement des compétences techniques et opérationnelles des acteurs de protection et; (iii) la mise en place des services juridiques et sociaux au sein de la Brigade des mineurs (juge, avocat(e)s, assistant(e)s sociales). Comme résultats, la privation de liberté des enfants a été réduite de près de 75% et la durée du traitement des dossiers de 12 à trois mois, en ligne avec la Convention des droits des enfants et les standards internationaux sur la justice. 
 
Innovation : Technologie du BioGaz, catalyseur de l’Assainissement Total Piloté par les Communautés
 
Pour assurer la durabilité de l’approche Assainissement Total Piloté par les Communautés nommée par le gouvernement TOGO-SANDAL, la technologie innovante de latrines à biogaz a été introduite en milieu familial et scolaire en 2020. 
 
En plus de la disponibilité des latrines durables, l’utilisation de biodigesteurs a démontré un potentiel important pour la résilience des communautés au changement climatique et de nombreux avantages sur le plan socioéconomique: les latrines durables permettent une amélioration de l’état de santé des enfants; l’utilisation du gaz de cuisine remplace le bois de chauffe et limite la déforestation tout en générant des revenus; le temps dégagé de la collecte du bois et de la cuisson est ainsi dédié aux enfants; l’application du digestat sur les cultures sous forme d’engrais favorise la production agricole. 
 
La réalisation de 14 latrines familiales à biogaz et cinq latrines scolaires à biogaz a suscité un réel intérêt auprès d’autres agences des Nations Unies, des maires et de plusieurs ministères. La mise à l’échelle est en cours avec le Gouvernement, les communes, les leaders communautaires, le SNU, la société civile et le secteur privé à travers la réplication du modèle par les petits opérateurs formés, le partenariat avec les institutions de microfinance pour l’octroi de crédits latrines préférentiels d’un à six pour cent aux familles.

WCAR,"WCARO, Senegal",Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Significant yet Insufficient Progress towards the KRCs Calls for Recentering on Acceleration Strategies 
 
Since 2018, the Key Results for Children have galvanized UNICEF teams across the region, working through alliances and partnerships, to drive transformative change for children through a common agenda.
 
Yet, at the close of the final year of the UNICEF Strategic Plan 2018-2021, it is apparent that too few of the top-level KRC targets were met, as longstanding bottlenecks prevailed, exacerbated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing conflicts in the region. 
 
In order to augment the pace of progress, the RMT’s commitment to prioritize a set of acceleration strategies will be crucial to overcome bottlenecks. The RO is well-positioned to play an enabling role in this endeavour, notably by supporting the integration of acceleration strategies into a cohort of 17 new Country Programmes that are expected to be developed over the next two years.
 
Fostering Cross-Functional Collaboration in Favour of Multi-Sector Integration and Multi-Country Action 
 
The ROMP 2022-2025 is predicated on an agile and fit-for-purpose business model. This involves customized, context-responsive and coherent RO technical assistance, cross-functional working modalities and multi-country co-creation of a common agenda, while securing efficiency gains across the region.
 
In particular, a shift to cross-functional teams within the RO, focused on the KRCs, is expected to contribute to steering COs towards more deliberate multi-sector approaches – a potential game-changer, whereby child deprivations are addressed in a holistic manner, with complementary social sectors pooling their knowledge and assets to amplify the scale of results. Cross-functional teams are well-positioned to foster the uptake of the KRC acceleration strategies across contributing programme areas, such as public finance, advocacy, innovation, evidence generation, social and behaviour change, social protection and shared-value partnerships.
 
Cross-functional RO teams have also proven to be pertinent vehicles for delivering coherent support to multiple countries to address complex common issues – a hallmark of Regional Office value addition. A frontrunner has been a team focused on the Sahel, which has successfully channeled the expertise of multiple subject-matter areas towards driving sharp strategic support to COs in the Sahel as well as high-level advocacy at the regional-level. The response to Ebola outbreaks in 2021 is another notable example of multi-country RO support to be built on in the future.
 
Harmonizing Humanitarian and Development Planning 
 
With 14 countries having issued a Humanitarian Action for Children (HAC) appeal and 12 countries having initiated the development of a new Country Programme in 2021, WCAR COs recognized the potential benefits of harmonizing humanitarian and development programme planning. 
 
In 2021, harmonized planning was promoted through a series of thematic clinics, convened by the RO, during which COs developing a new Country Programme had the opportunity to share experiences and innovations related to such cross-cutting topics as conflict sensitivity, UNICEF’s new Core Commitments for Children in Humanitarian Action, risk-informed programming and programming in the Sahel with a focus on localization. With RO support, the RMT provided further impetus towards harmonized humanitarian and development planning, monitoring and implementation, through a dedicated session during which actions were identified to advance this priority. 
 
Looking forward, the region will continue to spearhead harmonization of humanitarian and development planning for more efficient and impactful programmes.
 
Expanding Participatory Programming among Young People
 
RO support to initiatives, such as Generation Unlimited Youth Challenges in 15 countries, has contributed to expanding the demand for participatory programme design and implementation in the region, using human centered design techniques. Efforts to support the sustainable recovery from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to continue to serve as a key opportunity to leverage the reach and influence of young people to improve access to testing, promote healthy water, sanitation and hygiene practices, spread accurate information, conduct research, harness technologies for scale and champion mental wellness, while claiming their rights and holding governments to account.
 
Broadening the Scope of the Duty of Care Agenda as an Essential Enabler to Stay and Deliver for Children
 
The region’s commitment – supported by the RO through the ROMP 2018-2021 – to fully discharge its duty of care for personnel and promote a positive organizational culture, as a key enabler of results for children, remained at the fore in 2021 with the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on UNICEF personnel, particularly the most vulnerable and those in the most insecure and remote locations, with a focus on gender equality. 
 
Building on an initial focus on improving the living and working conditions of personnel and enhancing organizational culture, and informed by regular personnel surveys, the RMT placed heightened emphasis on diversity, equity and inclusion to foster ever greater openness, mutual understanding and respect within offices – as an essential ingredient of dignity and high-performing teams. The RMT equally underscored the importance of promoting psychological safety among personnel, through measures to improve self-awareness and probe unconscious biases, in a manner that is sensitive to context and culture. Flexible work arrangements at the duty station, guided by the imperative of achieving results for children, continued to be recognized as an opportunity to support the well-being of personnel while   staying and delivering in complex settings and when faced with sudden-onset crises. 
 
Moving forward, the orientations of the RMT in relation to the foregoing areas will continue to steer the priorities and approaches in the region. 
 
Looking Forward to 2022
 
In 2022, WCARO will build on the successes and challenges of 2021 and take forward the lessons set out in this report. The RO will be well-positioned to pursue the Key Results for Children in WCAR with renewed vigour, as it embarks upon the implementation of the KRC-focused ROMP 2022-2025. 
 
Through strategic, close-proximity support to Country Offices, catalytic partnerships and alliances, leveraging resources, high-level advocacy and policy dialogue among regional institutions and leaders as well as engagement of adolescents and young people as agents of change, the Regional Office will embody UNICEF’s unwavering commitment to the rights enshrined in the CRC, for every child.
