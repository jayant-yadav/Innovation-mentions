EAPR,Cambodia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Four crucial lessons came to light this year: i) the need for adaptive and flexible programming; ii) the importance of capitalizing on emerging opportunities and strengthening programme convergence; iii) the invaluable nature of strong partnerships with government, UN agencies and CSOs; and iv) technology as an enabler for results. 
 
Notwithstanding the negative impacts of school closures, COVID-19 allowed for the escalation of learning programmes, streamed online and broadcast via TV and radio. MoEYS commitment to digital education advanced in 2020, which lays a solid foundation for UNICEF to enhance future innovation in support of the MoEYS digital education vision.
 
Key achievements:

Supporting safe school reopening through provision of hygiene supplies to all public schools, benefitting 3.2 million children.
Development and implementation of a monitoring plan, leveraging MoEYS participation for monitoring 700 schools. The use of the KOBO tool for supply monitoring allowed building of national capacity and use of technology to gather and analyse data for action.
The development and dissemination of a ‘back to school’ booklet, an important tool for all school directors and teachers. This booklet was informed by global guidance and input from multiple sectors to highlight messages beyond health.
The Launching of ‘Back to School Healthy and Safe’ with MoEYS that reached children, parents and teachers with targeted messages on handwashing and hygiene, and broader health and safety behaviour. TV and radio spots and social media content reached more than 10 million people.
 
Key lessons learned:

Strong relationships with government and development partners allowed for leveraging of existing government systems and resources to achieve scale in emergency response.
Establishing regular internal UNICEF coordination meetings allowed for timely follow-up across sectors to identify priorities and resolve bottlenecks in the roll out of of back-to-school work.
Partnership with the World Food Programme allowed for timely and proper storage of supplies in preparation for distribution.
Use of the Kobo tool to combine UNICEF and MoEYS monitoring across all 25 provinces allowing streamlined data management and visualization. 
Digitization of learning underscores the importance of improving connectivity for schools and communities.
 
 
UNICEF supported MoI to operationalize guidelines sub-nationally, while MoI and the police helped ensure RCCE materials reached the most remote villages. Existing strong private sector relationships brought 10,500 businesses on board, and UNICEF’s ‘open source’ materials enabled organizations without their own resources to disseminate assets. Crucial partnerships with Facebook and major mobile companies further increased the reach of these assets. RCCE messaging was incorporated into ongoing campaigns – Cambodia PROTECT and the Adolescent and Youth Reference Group’s social media. 
 
Key lessons learned:

The lack of established community feedback channels limited the ability to obtain and respond immediately to valuable feedback. The office is working with the regional office to identify suitable technological solution for for communication and programme delivery.
An RCCE study in April revealed important information on RCCE message penetration (99 per cent of respondents received RCCE messages), impact on behaviour change (80 per cent agreed that public messaging was their main reason for practicing precautionary behaviours) and key information channels (Facebook is the most popular source of information). Some findings revealed gender differences, with women being more likely to practice protective behaviors. These and other findings continued to inform RCCE interventions, especially during the community transmission phase.
 
The above points will inform UNICEF’s RCCE strategy for the COVID-19 vaccine rollout and underscore the importance of developing an overarching Communication for Development Strategy in 2021. 
 
 
UNICEF supported the RGC to rapidly deploy the first-ever national COVID-19 cash transfer programme targeting poor households. This highlighted the importance of strong partnerships with government and partners, and the use of technology. The programme reached more than 665,000 ID poor households, with $168,648,555 of financial assistance from 25 June to 15 December.
 
UNICEF provided support to MoSVY to link the upgraded management information system to the ID poor database for beneficiary targeting, and to the private payment service provider (WING). Some 1,640 communes were trained to use dedicated tablets and software applications linked to the management information system to register beneficiaries and maximize efficiency. This included deployment of a mobile device management (MDM) solution to facilitate updating of the MIS.   Beneficiaries were enrolled in about 10 minutes and were able to immediately access funds using the services of the national payment service provider. 
 
MoSVY was supported to develop applications for data collection and to do a series of surveys on the effectiveness and impacts of cash transfer programmes in the COVID-19 context. The key findings indicate high level of satisfaction of the programme (over 90 %), with households using transfers primarily for food and health expenses.. It is expected that this approach to M&E will be strengthened for routine cash transfer programmes. The evidence collected significantly impacted the government’s decision to continue the emergency COVID-19 cash transfer programme in 2021, and will inform the acceleration of the National Social Protection Policy Framework 2016-2025, focusing on the Family Package of integrated social assistance for pregnant women, children, people with disability and elderly people to address immediate financial needs and build families. 

"
EAPR,China,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF China exhibited resilience in coping with the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. UNICEF China’s early and effective sharing of information and experiences with HQ, EAPRO and other country offices was useful to UNICEF’s overall response to the global pandemic, learning from China’s experience. 
 
During the pandemic, UNICEF coordinated its digital communication with government counterparts, and optimized the use of social media for RCCE to reach a wider audience. The synchronized use of social media platforms across partners in the health, education and child protection sectors helped reach millions of children, adolescents, parents and caregivers with information and key messages on COVID-19. Social media platforms also offered opportunity for feedback, allowing UNICEF and partners to enhance and tailor key messages, and adjust messaging as the situation evolved. UNICEF’s digital communication has thus adapted to include innovative Communication for Development approaches, with ways of listening to children and their caregivers, including learning from social media discussions and trends, and online Question and Answer sessions with adolescents and parents. 
 
In terms of development programming, several lessons learned and innovations have been identified. Firstly, UNICEF’s education programming in China needs to be technology-enabled, agile and flexible, especially during emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic when children’s education was significantly disrupted for an extended period of time. Secondly, UNICEF needs to strengthen existing and new government and private sector partnerships to address the evolving and emerging needs of children, such as working closely with the Internet industry and government partners on policymaking related to online child protection, and collaborating with private companies on promoting innovative technologies related to WASH. Thirdly, given the pandemic has created momentum to promote social protection as a means to strengthen resilience, especially among vulnerable populations, UNICEF should continue to invest in this area.  
 
UNICEF completed a gender programmatic review to identify good practices and lessons learned from the current cycle.  Gender-integrated approaches, embedded across programmes to address norms, behaviours and practices that lead to inequalities, will be strategized and adopted in order to: remove gender stereotypes in childcare practices, skills learning and education; tailor interventions to address adolescent health challenges in a gender-responsive way; and, incorporate gender considerations in child protection and social protection solutions.
 
Experience has also been drawn from UNICEF engagement in South-South cooperation and partnerships. China increasingly promotes cooperation with developing countries under the framework of South-South cooperation. Better advocacy of UNICEF’s value proposition for South-South cooperation and partnerships, as well as communication on results achieved through support from South-South cooperation is needed among policymakers and influencers in China. 
 
UNICEF’s “pilots to policy to results at scale” approach has been shown to be appropriate. Pilots have provided evidence, insights and innovative solutions to development challenges and informed the Government’s programmes and policies. UNICEF will continue to provide advice on Government pilots, concentrate efforts in underserved counties, expand upstream support on policy development, and share practices in child development, in line with international norms and standards, between countries.
 
In 2021, learning from experience, UNICEF will focus on: 1) improving quality of care and support for child health and development by addressing the triple burden of undernutrition, inadequate sanitation, environmental health issues, adolescent mental health, and preventing child deaths and injuries; 2) enhancing quality and inclusive learning through improving childcare and education in kindergarten, strengthening quality and relevance of education, and promoting learning and skills development for out-of-school children; 3) creating a protective environment for children with reduced violence and abuse and improved care and protection, including protection from bullying, violence and online exploitation; and 4) ensuring child-centred social policy that advocates for multidimensional child poverty reduction, child-sensitive social protection, and affordable, specialized and integrated essential social services. UNICEF China will also strengthen partnerships  in both public and private sectors to enhance investments to benefit children in China and beyond for the implementation of the CRC and 2030 Agenda.

EAPR,DP Republic of Korea,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Operations

2020 was an unprecedented year for the DPRK CO necessitating constant innovation and adaptation of the modus operandi to overcome new challenges and obstacles in the context of an unpredictable and rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation and response. 

Coordination was particularly complex given that the travel ban had reduced the international staff footprint in DPRK for most of the year to just three international staff (Representative, Deputy Representative for Operations and the Immunization Specialist) with the remaining team including section chiefs spread out around the world, working remotely across a multitude of time zones. The travel restrictions prevented newly appointed staff from assuming their duties in DPRK and presented additional obstacles in fully settling into their roles and striving to grasp the complexity of the country context. As of November 2020, all international staff have been officially out-posted to Bangkok, Thailand as the return to the duty station in Pyongyang is not possible soon.

Despite these challenges, the CO managed to adapt the regular schedule of staff meetings to accommodate a wide range of time zones and fully embraced online tools including seeking special permission for national seconded staff to use digital communication channels. Remote technical assistance by sections, facilitated through support from national staff, worked well in keeping essential services in Health, WASH and Nutrition running despite limitations on face-to-face meetings and online communication platforms with the government counterparts. 

Uncertainties around border openings and the return of international staff further complicated the operating environment, leading the CO into new and unchartered territory. The lack of field monitoring necessitated developing an innovative remote monitoring approach based on photography, telephone spot checks to be validated against an asset registry, and triangulation of data sources between routine indicators and supply distribution plans. To continue remote management of the CO operation after the remaining international staff left in early December, an innovative Remote Operations for Business Continuity Plan was developed and is currently operational with support from seconded national staff. 
 
The COVID-19 situation, in addition to implications of the sanctions regime on banking and financial flows, further exacerbated shortages of local cash availability. UNICEF successfully advocated the MoPH to take over the transportation costs of Nutrition supplies to reduce the financial burden to the CO, which is operating on an extremely cash conservation mode. 
At UNICEF premises, the installation of a Solar Energy System reduced the expenditure on electricity in 2020 compared to 2019 when it was completed. This reduction of costs can be attributed to reduced running of the diesel generator. 

The effect of the COVID-19 restrictions on reduced international staff presence, delays on importing supplies, lack of in-person field monitoring and the data and evidence gap is likely to affect resource mobilization efforts significantly. UNICEF has therefore commissioned a new Resource Mobilization Strategy for 2020 - 2022 to diversify partnerships when the humanitarian needs of children have increased. Many partners have highlighted that the lack of monitoring by international staff as an area of concern impacting future contributions and the credibility of UNICEF’s programme implementation. It is, therefore, critical that UNICEF’s international presence in DPRK is restored as soon as possible. 

Programme

Faced with the suspension of supply routes, UNICEF innovated the vaccine supply chain which had relied on air transportation. With support from UNICEF China, vaccine transport by air from China to DPRK was replaced by road transport. UNICEF China contracted a local freight forwarder to transport the vaccines (BCG and Penta) from China directly to DPRK using special refrigerated trucks. A total of 3 batches of vaccines were brought through this route in the first half of 2020. This innovation prevented vaccine stock-out while the airport is closed, thus enabling routine immunization services in health facilities to continue. MoPH with UNICEF support is expanding its cold chain capacity using solar direct drive refrigerators to address electricity shortage and improve resilience. 

In general, vaccine security remains a concern. Despite achieving high immunization coverage, DPRK is still dependent on external support from Gavi and other donors for the provision of most routine vaccinations and has yet to introduce the new vaccines against ROTA virus, Japanese Encephalitis, Human Papilloma Virus and Pneumococcal Pneumonia. This is also likely to be the case for potential COVID-19 vaccines procured through the COVAX facility. 
In the first quarter of 2020, UNICEF was able to distribute emergency WASH supplies from previous stocks to emergency affected children, women and vulnerable people. Due to border closure causing delays in the delivery of offshore supplies, stocks could not be timely replenished. However, it underscores the importance of maintaining contingency supply stocks as part of the emergency preparedness efforts instituted by UNICEF globally since 2016. During COVID-19, this practice allowed for uninterrupted programme delivery given the unprecedented challenges faced when bringing supplies. In 2021, this practice will be further strengthened. In support of climate resilient WASH, UNICEF has supported MoUM with technical proposals for the construction and improvement of WASH facilities in three county hospitals (Kangnam, Junghwa and Munchon Counties), including solar water pumping and heating system and DEWATS.
 
With shortages of essential nutrition supplies (RUTFs, therapeutic foods) for treatment of SAM and MAM cases, The MoPH and the Technical Working Group on Nutrition (TWG) are exploring alternative ways of supporting under-five children with SAM using locally available foods in addition to providing nutrition education messages to caregivers on optimal care practices while keeping young children at home. 

The COVID-19 situation has highlighted that the use of telemedicine and online capacity building activities is increasingly more important in the context of DPRK. UNICEF’s strong relationship with the Government should be leveraged to find solutions for the use of digital communication platforms by national counterparts and national seconded staff for training purposes. During 2020, the MoPH enhanced the use of Telemedicine System to disseminate relevant nutrition information to healthcare providers in provinces, counties and Ri’s. UNICEF will seek to further capitalize on these new avenues to scale up capacity development across programmes.

"
EAPR,Fiji (Pacific Islands),Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been a major catalyst for innovation, creating significant opportunities for programmatic learning and improvements beyond the immediate emergency response.
 
 The Health Care on Air initiative utilized an innovative way to train health workers during COVID-19 response, combining old (radio) and new (RapidPro and Internet of Good Things) technologies. UNICEF, the Fiji Nursing Council and the Fiji Higher Education board developed 41 made-for-radio training episodes on providing health and nutrition services during COVID-19, making them available to 14 PICTs, so far introduced in 6 countries. Once completed the course, the nurses will receive full accreditation for one year. Three important lessons emerged during the implementation:
 
o   Introducing RapidPro to health workers in the Pacific as part of the feedback and accreditation system has been challenging, requiring significantly more time and human resource investment than originally anticipated. However, once understood by health workers, RapidPro offers a flexible and versatile platform for future initiatives. 
o   Efforts to promote listenership need to be a core element of programme design and should begin before the first episodes are aired. Promotion should be conducted across several platforms, including chat groups, SMS text messages, direct phone calls, government notifications and radio. 
o   Integrating accreditation fulfilment into the initiative incentivized health workers to participate, including responding to assessment questions.
 
Since WASH played a critical role in the response to the pandemic, there was an opportunity to accelerate the promotion of hygiene practices. In Vanuatu, one provincial capital drafted a by-law requiring permanent handwashing stations at all institutions, including businesses, schools, government buildings, churches and restaurants. Other jurisdictions followed this example, with two other provincial capitals drafting by-laws. As a result, the number of durable handwashing stations, with piped water supply and drainage, is rapidly increasing in the country. 
 
The pandemic also highlighted the need to revisit preparedness and response approaches to ‘compounded’ emergencies of COVID and two severe tropical cyclones. It is crucial to coordinate risk communication with governmental and NGO to ensure that messages are consistent and do not cause negative impacts within schools and communities. 
 
The RCCE response to COVID was guided by the information from complaint mechanisms, such as dedicated hotline numbers, radio talkback/call-in discussion programmes and social media campaigns on Facebook. UNICEF successfully advocated the for the use of new technologies and qualitative research to generate evidence on audience behaviour.
 
There has also been an increased understanding that a more comprehensive approach to risk-informed planning, disaster risk reduction (DRR) and education in emergencies (EiE) work is required. EiE and DRR activities should include attention to COVID-19 and other disease outbreaks, noting that COVID-19 is not the first instance of school closures due to outbreaks in the region. Preparedness efforts must also shift away from a supply-focus and look at system readiness to keep students safe and ensure continued access to quality learning opportunities.
 
There is unprecedented demand for national and sub-national data related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The demand involves a wide range of data to better understand the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 and the consequences for children and families. Rapid data collection will help countries guide response and recovery efforts, including policy advocacy and programme planning to address children’s needs. At the same time, COVID-19 containment measures have constrained both national management information systems and face-to-face surveys, the two main traditional sources of data on the situation of children (although some of these activities are gradually returning). Therefore, additional support to strengthen the capacity of NSOs to rapidly collect data during emergencies through modern technologies, such as phone surveys, MICS Plus and online platforms, is critical. 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic also highlighted the need for increased programme focus on building a breadth of skills among youth. The potential of empowering youth to take the lead on WASH and hygiene promotion within communities and schools in the context of COVID-19, as shown in FSM through the U-Report partnership with the College of Micronesia, is a good example. Moreover, the partnerships with national parliament in Tonga on youth parliament and ministry of youth in Fiji on youth engagement in the development of national policy, are critical to ensuring the meaningful participation of children, adolescents and youth in national development and political processes on issues that concern them. 
 
UNICEF has partnered with the Pacific Conference of Churches (PCC) to integrate child protection in church activities with children, youth, women and men, and in priest/pastor training through the development of resources based on Christian scriptures, and to develop church child safeguarding policies. PCC membership includes all mainstream national councils of churches, thereby reaching 75 per cent of the Pacific population.
 
Health workers are often designated as change agents, yet they commonly lack the skills, motivation and interest to go beyond clinical care. Key innovations highlight the importance of investing in health worker behaviour and motivation to accelerate behaviour change in communities and contribute to the efficient use of scarce resources. A simple ‘how-to’ guide for health worker engagement with communities was designed in Kiribati. Its implementation demonstrated the importance of strong mid-level management leadership in building robust engagement systems that include communities, local governments and multi-sectoral referral pathways to co-create health outcomes. This contributed to 54 per cent of caregivers with knowledge of five essential family practices, exceeding the annual target by 34 per cent. 
 
UNICEF continues its partnership with Pacific Kids Food Revolution through a children’s cooking show in an innovative way that uses the power of reality television to share messages on healthy eating using fresh, local food that can be grown in backyard gardens. This edutainment show airing throughout the Pacific has led to an explosion of interest in the importance of healthy eating for young people.


"
EAPR,Indonesia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"As a result of the new Country Programme development process, including the mid-term review, programme strategy notes development, a risk-focused analysis of the situation of children in Indonesia and thematic evaluations, a set of important lessons learned was drawn and shifts implemented for the next programme cycle 2021-2025.
 
Evidence-based programmes at-scale
The 2016-2020 country programme focused on upstream modelling and replication through capacity-development at national and local levels in planning, evidence generation and knowledge management, reflecting the use of limited resources for maximum impact. This resulted in the establishment of good practices and proven models that the Government can take to scale. 
Systematic documentation, monitoring and evaluation of these models provided the evidence-base of “what works” for children. Already, local governments adopted and replicated learnings from the twelve models piloted in the areas of Nutrition, Education, WASH, Health and Child Protection during the 2016-2020 country programme. The design, financing and delivery of social service policies will replicate solutions derived from over fifty evidence generation activities during the current programme. Going forward, UNICEF will continue to systematically evaluate its programmes with Government and utilize lessons learned to provide policy and legislative advocacy for leveraging government ownership and resource allocation for programming at scale. 
Subnational implementation through field offices
Indonesia is a vast and diverse archipelago with challenges in connectivity and access. Decentralized governance sees a large share of public resources directly allocated to districts, each with autonomous decision-making structures, but often with weak fiscal and human capacity for planning and delivery of quality services. A review of UNICEF field presence in East Asia and Pacific substantiated the continued relevance of subnational engagement to secure and support commitments to child wellbeing by local governments. 
UNICEF will continue to operate with a country office in Jakarta and seven field locations, which contributed to achieving 2020 planned results at subnational level. In line with the 2020 Office of Internal Audit and Investigations audit recommendations, field presence will be more systematically linked to evidence generation, advocacy and policy advice. Government ownership will be strengthened through additional coordination and joint monitoring mechanisms with local governments and UNICEF field offices under the leadership of the Ministry of Home Affairs. 
To facilitate focus and programme convergence for results at scale within targeted provinces, the new country programme has reduced the number of focus provinces from eleven to eight. At the same time, programmes implemented across the focus provinces were harmonized and capacities of the chiefs of field offices were strengthened in crucial areas such as public financing for children. Under the lead of a newly created Chief of Field Operations position, field offices will drive engagement with provincial governors on the replication of proven models with local budgets and advocate for adhesion to a comprehensive capacity development platform spanning all UNICEF-supported sectors. A specific focus will be put on improving data quality and availability for local target setting and programme performance monitoring, including through the localisation of the National Statistics’ SDG Dashboard supported by UNICEF and use of local administrative data sources. 
Risk informed programmes and climate change
Key programme risks relate to natural disasters and climate change. To prepare for improved risk mitigating measures, UNICEF conducted a multi-hazard risk assessment and a risk-focused situation analysis of children before designing its next country programme. To advance risk-informed programming in the humanitarian to development continuum, emergency preparedness, disaster risk reduction and management, and climate action for and with children will be incorporated under the programme planning and monitoring function in the next country programme. 
Experience and collaborative relationships gained from the response to the 2018 earthquake/tsunami emergencies in Lombok and Central Sulawesi, as well as from piloting child-centered contingency planning related to one of Indonesia’s most active volcanoes, will be fed into the ongoing revision of the national disaster management legal and regulatory framework. In strengthening emergency preparedness and response capacities for multi-hazard risks, including public health emergencies and those induced by environmental and climate-driven threats, UNICEF will leverage its leadership of four humanitarian clusters at inter-agency level, its network of field offices, new Core Commitments for Children in Humanitarian Action and will regularly analyse and synthesize national administrative data sets, early warning systems, online polls and big data, including from the perspective of gender-specific vulnerabilities.
COVID-19
The COVID-19 response has required an ‘all-of-government’ effort, supported through high-level cross-ministerial partnerships. This has required UNICEF to play an important ‘bridging role’ to ensure technical input from conventional ministry partners and guidance from national emergency coordination mechanisms translated into effective sub-national implementation. The response has been facilitated by UNICEF staff embedded within Government’s coordination teams at the national and provincial levels. 
Given physical distancing measures, UNICEF Indonesia adopted remote modalities for capacity development, programme coordination and monitoring. Use of technologies like Interactive Voice Recognition (IVR) for training of health workers and volunteers in remote areas helped fill capacity gaps for services. The good practices will be systematized after the pandemic to support a green recovery, with less travel and hybrid physical/virtual meetings for inclusion of wider stakeholder groups in programme mechanisms. Design and remote dissemination of COVID-19-related guidance documents has been a critical innovation to ensure rapid resumption of essential services and will inform the COVID vaccination roll-out in 2021. 
Equally important has been the use of innovations in data and analytics which has provided critical information on where service disruptions pose the most serious risk. Real-time data collection through mobile platforms provided critical information on the operational status of health and nutrition services; the availability of basic infrastructure such as hand-washing with soap stations; public perceptions regarding safety and willingness to resume service utilization; safe behaviour (mask use, safe distancing and hygiene behaviour); and critical issues such as acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines. IVR technology has also been used both for polling and for dissemination of information through ‘chatbots.’ Finally, through partnerships with Facebook and Google, the use of ‘big-data’ have been central to understanding population mobility and its effect on COVID-19 transmission and informing major policy efforts in the country.  

"
EAPR,Lao People's Dem Rep.,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"2020 has been one of the most unusual years of our lifetime, with the COVID-19 pandemic changing lives like never. In Lao PDR, the Government took swift action to contain the virus and although no deaths have been reported, the socio-economic impact of the pandemic has been felt particularly among the most vulnerable children and their families pushing the organization to design and implement innovative approaches to respond to the urgent needs of a population at risk. The pandemic has also affected UNICEF’s working modalities in Lao PDR which shifted drastically, from a traditional culture promoting physical presence to an online presence, affecting also the way UNICEF’s partners work.  
Programme innovation/lessons learned:
During the initial lockdown in Laos, life came to a complete halt. Schools were closed, and about 1.7 million children were affected. UNICEF Lao PDR worked hand in hand with the Government (MoES) to prioritize the safe reopening of schools and learning continuity after a three months’ closure. For all students in the country, from pre-primary to secondary, a new television station was quickly set up, serving about two million children below 18. For those who did not have television, radio and online options were also available, benefiting from an estimated 92 per cent of households with access to mobile phones and 20 per cent with access to radio.
UNICEF launched the ‘Safely Back To School Campaign’ with key messages on COVID-19 prevention, reaching out to 3 million people with access to internet. Guidance was shared on social media as part of the campaign, and platforms like WhatsApp were used to get key messages across among teachers. In addition, media throughout the country were engaged and shared trustworthy information on COVID-19 for children, parents and teachers. Safe school operational guidelines, including information on water and hygiene, cleaning schools, mental health and psychological support; and a framework for reopening schools were disseminated. 
In addition, before the reopening of schools, the Ministry of Education and Sports reviewed the curriculum and prioritized what should be taught when students returned. The school calendar was extended by two months to make up for the weeks lost during the lockdown. These measures helped minimize the disruption in their learning path. 
A second campaign for the start of the school year 2020-21 was launched at the end of August and had over 8 million impressions and reached over 3.5 million people via social media platforms. Messages around parenting, mental health and psychosocial support were integrated to ensure that all children return to school. UNICEF mobilized the support of key partners, such as USAID, EU, DFAT/BEQUAL, UNESCO, WFP, ChildFund Laos and Save the Children, to help the MoES mount and execute the national campaigns. Key messages were complemented with practical tools, such as the provision of posters to schools. Surveys targeting students, teachers and parents were launched as part of the #SafelyBackToSchool campaign and used to inform other COVID-19 education interventions. Lao PDR’s first ‘Back to School Campaign’ for the reopening of schools after the lockdown was globally recognized by UNICEF as “inspirational” and “compelling” for its evidence-based and participatory design and nationwide reach. A case story was published online to showcase how Lao PDR has ensured the safe reopening schools during COVID-19, and how Lao children were “Heading back to school in the pandemic.” 
 
Innovations in working modalities: 
Following the COVID-19 outbreak and the lockdown, UNICEF Lao PDR activated its Business Continuity Plan (BCP) from March until August. Working from home arrangements were the preferred work modality, with enhanced messages on the importance of continuation of preventive practices conveyed to all staff, and with the office accessible for critical staff. To support the UNICEF team during these challenging times, the office gave utmost attention to staff wellbeing, including daily virtual all staff meetings during the first weeks of the BCP activation, and later two to three virtual all staff meetings per week. Moreover, virtual tea/coffee hours with the Representative a.i. two to three times per week for colleagues to call in and touch base on a voluntary basis, or to raise any issues of concern were organized. The office also developed internal UNICEF Laos COVID-19 guidelines and produced and disseminated daily internal bulletins for all staff. In addition, regular updates for internal staff on IP specific issues, like transnational teleworking for colleagues in need were provided. 
Senior management had regular consultations with the staff association to assess the situation and wellbeing of staff and to discuss the expansion of Peer Support Volunteers (PSV) pool as well as virtual training for new PSV by the regional staff counselor. Staff was encouraged to maintain work live balance by exercising leave, flexible working arrangements and flexible UN holiday options. Furthermore, the office provided accelerated ICT support and equipment to all staff in support of teleworking arrangements. A key lesson learned is that team communication and transparency are crucial at all times, but even more so in times of crisis. Staying connected while practicing physical distancing and the continuous availability of the Representative and management team to address any potential issue proved to be critical for a successful programme implementation and staff wellbeing.

"
EAPR,Malaysia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Malaysia’s lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic has provided significant learnings to help ‘reimagine’ a youth engagement strategy in these current circumstances. Key learnings include: (1) the importance of integrating ‘inclusive communication’ measures from the onset of the design process to help strengthen and promote the participation of young people with disabilities, and utilising accessible technical functions on video conferencing platforms for online engagements; (2) and, due to the lack of data and information available on remote MHPSS services for adolescents,  utilising digital platforms and innovations as a social listening tool and engagement channel to better understand adolescent concerns remotely, helped to inform the creation and dissemination of vital MHPSS adolescent friendly information. Digital engagement needs to go beyond posting information on UNICEF social media channels. During movement control order, UNICEF has learned that our digital engagement needs to foster two-way communication and meaningful participation beyond disseminating information and avoid fatigue in an overcrowded space. UNICEF Malaysia has strengthened its online engagement by creating a new platform (KitaConnect) to engage young people meaningfully online, as well as utilized online platform to provide tele-MHPSS services for children with disabilities and their families. 
 
With COVID-19 lockdown and school closures disrupting learning for five million students, UNICEF pivoted existing programmes by forging strategic partnerships and accelerating innovations for alternative and remote learning for both mainstream and marginalised groups. The partnership with the Ministry of Education (MOE) via the Digital Educational Learning Initiative Malaysia (DELIMa) has led to the initiation of new partnerships and building of networks with technology giants such as Google, Microsoft and Apple, and instrumental in Malaysia being one of the priority countries for Reimagine Education. Additionally, attempts to mainstream innovation has led to the introduction of future skills on TikTok i.e. ""Guru Future Skills"" which has resulted in almost 11,500 followers and a total of 2.36 million views of the videos posted, and the showcasing of young people's reflections during COVID i.e. “Voices of COVID Generation” via Google Earth tour and a 3D virtual exhibition. The work on Teacher Digital Learning Community, with a prospect of being sustained into the regular pre- and in-service teacher training programmes, capitalizes on the inclusive use of technology with Google accessibility features for teacher and children with disabilities. 
 
While technologies have facilitated mass messaging, their use has highlighted serious challenges, including the propagation of misinformation, deepening digital exclusion, issues around data privacy and the struggle to hold technology providers and users to account. In the context of Malaysia, despite the high digital penetration, MOE reported that more than one third (37%) of students lacked access to online learning due to limited devices and access to Internet. Only 15% of students have access to a computer, 5.8% to tablets, and 46.5% to smartphones which means that even those that have access are limited by the devices they use. The situation for marginalized students is undoubtedly much worse. This an important lesson learned and area that requires further attention by UNICEF and partners.
 
Due to weak and not-well defined roles of Social Welfare service providers, UNICEF brought the issue of weak Social Welfare service providers to the political agenda with special focus on advocating and promoting strengthening the position of a social worker. The success of remote case management tips for social service workers demonstrated the importance of partnerships with the Malaysian Association of Social Workers in supporting the frontline workforce during COVID-19, and the need to disseminate information in flexible ways, including through webinars. Issues concerning children affected by migration continues to be a sensitive topic. Xenophobia and discrimination increased during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, this situation created opportunities for renewed advocacy and engagement with the public on the situation of children affected by migration; including child immigration detention and access to social welfare and child protection services. To navigate the challenges of a changing government climate and COVID-19, there is a need to be flexible, and patient, but also persistent and prepared to act at short notice.
 
Parents and Practitioners needed capacity building as well as guidance in order to appropriately use online platforms to deliver and access services, and to effectively support children (especially children with disabilities) with online learning. Fathers’ engagement in supporting children with learning at home is limited, greater investment is needed in fathers’ support groups/networks to encourage such engagement. Ultimately, equal fathers’ engagement in caregiving and children’s education at home enables empowerment of women and girls and increase gender equality in the home. It is critical to develop partnerships with father/male support organisations/religious leader groups, or in their absence the development of a father’s support network to encourage greater involvement in caregiving and father responsibilities at home.
 
A suggested way forward is to ensure that all programmes include a gender analysis (as part of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation) to identify any gender disparities or negative gender norms and propose programme adaptations to mitigate these. In addition, all programme indicators need to be gender sensitive and disaggregated by age, sex and disability. Many homes do not have access to any devices, only a mobile phone or one digital device capable of accessing online therapy/education content. In future, programme interventions need to incorporate data packages, internet bundles and access to digital devices to increase engagement particularly for the most marginalised groups what would require further strengthening public-private partnerships in ITC areas. 
 
With COVID-19, evidence generation had to quickly adapt methodologies to largely unexpected and changing scenarios. Research and studies had to be conducted almost completely remotely, while taking all necessary precautions keeping in mind the ‘do no harm’ principle. This required more time, to accommodate changes in design that were not foreseen at onset. It had resulted in delays as data collection strategy to be rethought and readapted to the COVID-19 scenario given large challenges in accessing key informants. However, many opportunities emerged which helped to further strengthened design and methodologies which in turn, resulted in enriched learnings. Flexibility has allowed for completion and for learning.

EAPR,Mongolia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons learned
Facing new challenges created by the pandemic, including the multiple impacts of preventive measures on Mongolia’s economy and child well-being, UNICEF adjusted its operation strategies. Because of the restrictions, most capacity-building activities switched to virtual mode and programme monitoring was completed remotely. UNICEF Mongolia also expanded its interventions to adapt to the emerging needs of the most vulnerable children and those of newly identified affected groups, e.g. children stranded abroad and domestic violence survivors. This included RCCE messaging designed for children with disabilities; joint support to the Ministry of Education on remote learning; child feeding and nutrition interventions; and supporting Government social protection interventions for vulnerable groups. These correspond to the findings of multiple studies identifying socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19, such as: (a) herder households’ and with persons with disabilities’ income loss, (b) food price increases, and (c) school closures.
Innovative e-learning practice
When schools and kindergartens closed in February 2020 due to COVID-19, the Government responded swiftly, maintaining educational services via the mammoth task of making all levels of classroom teaching televised. Although this was the first substantial move towards distance learning within the general education sector, many vital aspects of the distance learning environment were still absent. To ensure continuity of educational service to children during this time, UNICEF, UNESCO and UNFPA jointly implemented an initiative to strengthen the e-learning system and online learning content for pre-primary, primary and secondary education. E-learning is relatively new in Mongolia, particularly for the pre-primary and general education sectors. This initiative is thus a pioneer and innovative practice in this area for Mongolia, and contributed significantly to/created the basis for digital transformation in the education sector.
As part of this initiative, 104 pieces of exemplary interactive content are to be developed, of which 54 have been completed and made publicly available since December 2020. Schools and kindergartens were closed again in mid-November due to local transmission of COVID-19. Through the interactive content, children and parents can access additional support in the most interactive and interesting way. Themed as ‘Digital Adventures’, the interactive content is designed to support existing television lessons. The content transforms the traditional learning objectives of classroom teaching into two-dimensional cartoon animation. Each ‘Adventure’ starts with a unique plot-driven story that leads to a problem-solving activity which immerses the student in the learning process. Since its December 2020 launch, children, parents and teachers have used and benefited from this online content cumulatively over 106,000 times. This approach is proving itself highly effective for its target audience of pre-primary, primary and general education children, as shown by the initial reactions and feedback from users. According to a MoES rapid assessment, over 94 per cent of 268 teachers surveyed agree that the interactive content is age-appropriate and interesting, supports creativity and meets the learning needs of children.
Haze Gazer
‘A Public Eye on Air Pollution’, a joint initiative with UNDP, was selected among the top five projects out of 196 participating countries in the Innovation Challenge call. Air pollution causes serious health risks to children and mothers in Mongolia and is always on the agenda of the Government and many development partners and NGOs. However, although data and evidence exist, it is insufficient for thorough analyses and its quality needs validating. To fill the gap, non-traditional sources and big data were seen as an alternative to be used to effectively evaluate air-pollution-related interventions and programmes. UNICEF, in partnership with UNDP, supported the development of ‘Haze Gazer’, an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered, social-media-based web application to monitor the collective impacts of air pollution on human health and safety, communities’ socioeconomic situation, and public perception of interventions to improve air quality in Ulaanbaatar. Funding for this initiative was secured after UNICEF and UNDP Mongolia staff jointly applied for the Innovation Challenge in 2019.
Under the slogan, ‘Clean air is a human right’, the partners launched the Haze Gazer platform on 10 December 2020 (International Human Rights Day) via Zoom. Over 100 audiences participated in the event and eight international and national guest speakers were invited to discuss air pollution and human rights issues. The platform, published in English and Mongolian, provides an AI-estimated, location-specific air quality map, coupled with socioeconomic impact reports collected through an automated social media messaging service. In addition to the web platform, the ‘Call to Action’ campaign reached over 396,000 unique profiles, including 45,000 post engagements (clicks, comments, messages, likes and shares). Over 1,600 contributors helped create community reports on the platform.
More layers of information need to be added to the platform and an air pollution alert system needs to be built to warn the community of spikes in respiratory infections, COVID-19 cases and air quality levels. This can be based on the machine learning prediction models developed as part of the Haze Gazer platform.
MICS Plus
To align with the principles of evidence-based decision-making even during emergencies, UNICEF supported the National Statistical Office in nearly real-time situation updates, critical in rapidly evolving humanitarian situations, including the COVID-19 pandemic. A computer-assisted telephone interviewing team reached over 2,200 households nationwide and derived updates on different socioeconomic indicators. High telephone penetration and close collaboration with bagh and khoroo (smallest administrative units in rural and urban areas) governors, allowed the operationalization of probabilistic random sampling, unlike many other telephone surveys. The MICS global team and East Asia and Pacific Regional Office were critical in bringing in timely high-level technical expertise.
A model-based (propensity score matching) substitution technique was applied that allowed a response rate as high as 97 per cent to be reached. This approach thus enabled a nationally representative longitudinal household survey while significantly reducing its cost compared with face-to-face interviews. Two rounds of data collection were completed in September and November and the third round will start in January 2021.
"
EAPR,Myanmar,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"COVID-19 has created a favourable backdrop for several programmatic innovations and lessons learned, enabling the UNICEF Myanmar Country Office (MCO) to focus and scale up its approach to preparedness and response. 
 
To support the continuity of children’s learning, home-based learning materials for primary school children were developed, while working with the GoM to ensure students and teachers have a safe learning environment when schools reopen. COVID-19 highlighted the lack of WASH facilities in schools nationwide as a stark need. Children have shown increased stress due to the uncertainly and change in routine, requiring psychosocial care and support. To address these issues, MCO developed a multi-sectoral approach to support children’s learning in a comprehensive manner and promoted sustainability by working to build the GoM’s capacity in these areas. With funds from the GPE and other sources, UNICEF stepped up work on WASH in schools and MHPSS as part of the education’s COVID-19 response. UNICEF supported the roll out of MHPSS and referrals training targeting 72,000 teachers in 65 ‘COVID-19 hotspot’ priority townships across the country. This ongoing MHPSS teachers’ training includes awareness raising on the social, mental and personal effects of COVID-19 and seeks to promote positive coping skills amongst teachers and students. 
 
Community-based, adolescent-led activities in Rakhine, initially focusing on the prevention of violence against children, were repurposed to address issues of mental health, violence and abuse exacerbated during COVID-19 because of the enforced isolation. Adolescents and youth were empowered to take control of the situation and become leaders in raising awareness and educating their peers and communities about the pandemic and its relationship with increased issues of child protection; they were also encouraged to care for and protect each other, supporting help-seeking behaviors. The initiative communicated through multiple ‘touchpoints’ including adolescent leaders’ Facebook pages, closed Facebook groups, chat bots, interactive voice responses (IVR) and surveys reached over 4.5 million people by end of August. UNICEF launched two toll-free MHPSS helplines: one providing direct support for children, adolescents and caregivers while the second offering a dedicated helpline targeting frontline workers addressing their self-care needs. 
 
To facilitate scale up of handwashing stations, UNICEF used performance-based criteria to hire several local suppliers to install a variety of stations appropriate for local conditions. Using this new modality, as well as by working through partners and providing additional funding to the GoM, more than 7,500 handwashing facilities were installed within the first several months of the response reaching more than 1.9 million people.  To track installation and functionality of the handwashing facilities, a RapidPro-based tracking tool was developed using Viber. 
 
Evidence from social sciences and use of data were critical to inform decisions for effective actions and interventions. Each month, UNICEF through surveys and focus group discussions, collected gender disaggregated data to understand how the public experienced COVID-19. Over 9,300 respondents were consulted. The findings have informed several stakeholders in their creation of infographics, printed materials and audio messages to address the misperceptions identified. Sharing culturally adapted messages through multiple channels has proved critical for all sectors, including education, nutrition and WASH. Audio messages on COVID-19 prevention were developed and translated into 87 ethnic languages, and printed materials into 57 languages, aimed to provide timely and accurate life-saving information to affected populations. As such, over 38 million people were reached through multiple platforms and approaches with COVID-19 prevention messages, including in hard-to-reach areas. According to national monthly surveys commissioned by UNICEF, 74% of respondents, including youth, could recall at least three protective practices in October, and up to 80% in November.
 
Simplified approaches [including reduced frequency of follow up visits for treatment of children with acute malnutrition and family mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) screening] were used to maintain life-saving nutrition services. In collaboration with the GoM, standard operating procedures were developed for the provision of nutrition services and the promotion of breastfeeding using pictorial counselling cards and posters. Around 300 health workers were trained virtually on simplified nutrition protocols to enhance their capacities for provision of quality nutrition services despite the pandemic. 
 
To boost purchasing power and mitigate the impact of COVID-19, UNICEF provided technical advice to support the vertical and horizontal expansion of the MCCT with a one-off payment to an additional 272,000 pregnant women living in States and Regions where MCCT is not being implemented. Using social and behavioral change communication approaches, UNICEF adapted guidelines for MCCT field-staff, focusing on Do No Harm and minimizing risk of COVID-19 transmission during implementation of the cash transfer. In addition, decentralized approaches were modelled in Kayin State: context-specific social programmes in response to COVID-19 were developed, thus optimizing limited resources, which were based on Child-Focused Township Profiles (CFTSP) providing localized data on children and Local Social Plans (LSP) mapping social needs.
 
Despite COVID-19, it was possible to ensure business continuity of the office through alternative working arrangements, including reduced presence of staff in the office to working from home under the stay-at-home orders for Yangon and Rakhine. Extended periods of work from home arrangements were enabled by enhanced use of mobile network technology. While recognizing the challenges that includes poor connectivity in some locations, the ability to sustain virtual operations for several months under an activated Business Continuity Plan was an achievement. Capacity for remote and virtual team collaboration increased significantly during the pandemic: staff learned to hold meetings on virtual internet platforms and got work done electronically, thereby reducing significantly the consumption of paper and accelerated certain transactions and processes. Furthermore, UNICEF participated in the implementation of the new Booking Hub software, managed by WFP, that provides for online booking of air travel and local vehicle transportation services.

"
EAPR,Papua New Guinea,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Through UNICEF PNG’s ongoing monitoring work, such as meetings, reports and other documentation, numerous lessons have been identified in all areas of work. A synopsis of these lessons learned is captured below. 
PROGRAMME EFFECTIVENESS
COVID-19 as an opportunity: Faced with implementing the polio vaccine with the already stretched health system, UNICEF PNG combined COVID-19 RCCE and the polio campaign in Eastern Highlands. 
Matrix management: UNICEF PNG has already been implementing matrix management. For example, the multi-country evaluation specialist is currently supporting both PNG and Fiji Offices. 
Extended benefits of local partnerships: Local partnerships continue to have wide-reaching positive effects; not only through strengthening local civil society, but also through programme efficiencies. For example, Ginigoada, a local partner, negotiated with a local hardware store to reduce the cost of materials for community-built water tanks and handwashing facilities.
Virtual field visits: The innovative use of virtual field visits opens new and exciting ways to engage with donors to promote advocacy opportunities.
Remote monitoring: Due to COVID-19 restrictions, regular monitoring was not possible. Instead, UNICEF PNG uses U-Report/RapidPro and KoboToolbox (including COVID-19 response) and has launched the Partner Reporting Portal on eTools. For example, implementing partners collected data on early childhood education using KoboToolbox on tablets and telephones. This innovative way to collect data is paperless and allows for real-time monitoring and analysis of the IECD project.
Regional/global partnership frameworks with other key development actors (i.e. NFIs):  There is a need for partnership frameworks with other key development actors to facilitate partnerships at the national level. Negotiating the World Bank Partnership took unexpected effort. As this partnership was so unique, the partnership and legal frameworks as well as the payment were all new to UNICEF and required consultation across several different regional and HQ UNICEF offices to gain approval (legal, partnership, statistics), all while concurrently being progressed through the World Bank mechanisms. 
Limited space for qualitative initiatives: COVID-19 restrictions had a considerable negative impact on data and evidence initiatives. Although UNICEF PNG was able to transition to remote data collection (i.e. Kobo Toolbox and U-Report), this meant limited space for qualitative initiatives to directly engage with participants/communities. 
Integrating the situation analysis as part of the Common Country Assessment: As the Chair for the Inter-Agency People Priority Working Group, UNICEF PNG led the integration of the UNSDF Common Country Assessment and the Situation Analysis along with WHO’s Country Cooperation Strategy. Through this integration, the different agencies can further streamline and complement programming with the same analysis. 
Inter-agency implementation vs. programme design: One challenge of joint programming is the coherence of implementation. Although the programme uses the UNDAF/UNSDCF results framework, there is divergence at the inter-agency implementation level. For example, limited field visits were coordinated for implementation or monitoring.  
SECTORAL
Cross-sectoral opportunities: A cross-sectoral hygiene kit was developed to improve hygiene practices and disseminate social messages on GBV to rural communities. PNG has some of the highest rates of violence against children and women. The hygiene kits were locally procured, making them more cost-effective and with a lower CO2 emission footprint, compared to the kits available at Supply Division.
Expanding mental health psychosocial support with U-Report: In a country with limited MHPSS during a time where the need is increasing, UNICEF PNG expanded the only national MPHSS response service in PNG, the ChildFund telephone hotline using U-Report.  
Training duty bearers vs. external suppliers: As UNICEF PNG continues to support the health system, the installation of new cold chain equipment will now be done by national and provincial biomedical technicians after they complete a UNICEF-supported training programme. This is more cost-effective than engaging a supplier that provides a service bundle, including supervision, and will support COVID vaccine cold chain needs.
Cold Chain Monitoring: To ensure no break to the cold chain for vaccines, temperature alarms and continuous temperature monitoring systems are being installed across the country, this will support the COVID-19 vaccinations. 
Value-for-money process in supplies: In the WASH sector, value-for-money processes led to the establishment of local long-term arrangements for supplying hygiene kits, which reduced costs and ensured timely availability during the COVID-19 response. A total of 6,000 hygiene kits were procured at US$53.58 per kit, including delivery at distribution points. 
WASH sub-national investment: The UNICEF-supported WASH service delivery arrangement endorsement meetings in focus districts were successful. Stakeholders in Goroka and Nawaeb planned their own investments to meet WASH plan targets.
WASH ODF external verification teams: Now that the teams have been endorsed by district WASH committees, the rate of ODF verification has greatly improved. In Goroka, the total number of ODF-verified communities increased from 9 to 35 in less than two weeks.
One key lesson to highlight has been community engagement to support communities/rights holders to become duty bearers. UNICEF PNG continues to emphasize that the involvement of community members is critical for expanding access to and increasing demand for quality services with appropriate administration, capacity development and supervision. In each sector, community members are supported to be meaningfully engaged in mechanisms – from joining education boards of management to WASH community mobilizers participating on district administration teams. 
This approach continues to yield long-lasting results in the health sector. In the very remote Koroba Kopiago district, VHVs saw for themselves that women who live two or three days’ walk from the nearest health facility were giving birth along the way. Following UNICEF training, the VHVs led an initiative to build three maternity waiting homes where women who live at a distance from health facilities can stay to await the birth of their child. The local community contributed cash and in-kind donations and built the homes, which are managed by the VHVs and the community.
Oil Search Foundation demonstrated their commitment by partnering with the community and VHVs to upgrade and build a modern maternity waiting home and a maternity ward in their health facility. This will greatly improve access to maternal, newborn and child health services in this very remote district."
EAPR,Philippines,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The pandemic required UNICEF to modify strategies and accelerate cross-cutting programming. UNICEF’s experience and capacity in both development and humanitarian programming allowed it to effectively engage the Philippine Government on both emergency response and service continuity. 
 
Shifting to online digital platforms: opportunities and challenges in public health emergencies
 
UNICEF supported the continuation of essential health, nutrition, education, WASH and child protection services by working with the government and communities. Given the restrictions on travelling to critical areas, the team quickly transformed implementation using online platforms to conduct training and information dissemination. UNICEF reached a significant number of people by making all services accessible online, including enlisting sign language interpreters, and developing ‘COVID-19 basics’ sessions for people with hearing impairment. 
 
However, online platforms are constrained in areas where Internet coverage is poor. It has also been difficult to monitor the impact of these initiatives on the participants, but UNICEF continues to explore methods to assess the results.
 
Risk communication and community engagement shifted online, with COVID-19 content published on UNICEF Philippines’ Facebook page reaching 60 million users by the end of 2020. UNICEF took advantage of digital media, as usage increased exponentially during the pandemic, to position itself as a trustworthy source of critical COVID-19 information. By the end of 2020, 8,100 young boys and girls in Mindanao signed up as U-Reporters and joined conversations about their lives and futures amid the pandemic on U-Report – UNICEF’s proprietary messaging tool for young people.
 
While shifting to online channels allowed UNICEF to reach more audiences, it is unclear how this contributed to sustained community engagement and behaviour change. Limitations of social media channels with disaggregated audience data also resulted in gaps in reporting.
 
Furthermore, disseminating technical content for niche audiences on UNICEF Philippines’ digital platforms might have fragmented UNICEF messaging, resulting in inconsistent or low engagement and views for certain content. There is also a need to standardize the reporting of website and social media data for programme activity results. As digital platforms continue to rapidly evolve, growing UNICEF’s digital ecosystem and improving its capacity for online advocacy, evidence generation/dissemination and connecting with new emerging audiences are the main opportunities in 2021.  

As public health emergencies in the country dominated 2020, UNICEF played a key role in supporting the government’s nationwide roll-out of the massive polio and measles immunization campaign at the same time the country is dealing with the pandemic.  
 
Looking forward, UNICEF’s experience with supporting the supply/cold chain management for immunization will be of significant benefit for the COVID-19 vaccine introduction in the Philippines. The Vaccine and Immunization Readiness and Assessment conducted by UNICEF with DOH showed critical gaps that require urgent attention in cold chain management to handle the COVID-19 vaccines. The COVID-19 vaccine preparedness will also support addressing the long-term bottlenecks in the supply chain for vaccines.

Advocacy and innovation for continued learning  

The Philippines ended 2020 as the only country in the region with face-to-face schooling fully closed without having ever reopened since March. Through much of 2020, UNICEF sustained advocacy for the safe reopening of schools which involved roundtable discussions with DepEd and key development partners, communications campaigns, and public statements. However, while sectoral leadership agreed to reopen schools, the decision to pilot face-to-face learning in low-risk areas was later reversed, reflecting a lack of clear public support for the re-opening of schools. This has shown the efficacy of evidence-based advocacy and UNICEF’s convening role at technical level, while at the same time brought to light the need to further influence public sentiment and other branches of the government. 
 
Even while the government was discussing face-to-face learning, UNICEF had already been supporting DepEd in rolling out its online platforms to ensure continuity of learning. Online digital technologies such as e-books and ICT4ALS reached millions of children and adolescents who would otherwise have been left out because of school closures. UNICEF also reached 2,636 students in 50 multi-grade schools in remote areas without Internet technology and supported them through the School-in-a-Bag, a joint project with a leading telco in the country to provide a package of ICT materials (laptop, tablets, etc.) with pre-programmed learning materials and mother tongue instruction. 
 
Strengthening the policy environment for children’s rights

The projected increase in poverty reinforces the importance of UNICEF and government collaboration to address all aspects of child poverty. Generating timely and relevant evidence on child rights deprivations can be used to inform government decisions on short- and medium-term policies and programmes to address the social and economic impacts of COVID-19. The UNDP-UNICEF assessment of the social and economic impact of COVID-19 (and other studies underway and planned) – conducted using innovative sampling and data collection methodologies to overcome access barriers – is recognized by the government as an important contribution to monitor and understand the evolving situation of children. 
 
To respond to the impact of the COVID-19 measures, UNICEF also led partners on business continuity planning to adapt child protection programmes to the new normal. For example, the SaferKidsPH Consortium rebranded online safety campaigns and highlighted the link between increased online risk and containment measures to inform shifts in strategies ensuring that child protection response is effective during the pandemic. 
 
Shifting to teleworking modality 

UNICEF Philippines has spent most of the year teleworking due to the quarantine protocols but has been able to continue its operations as seen in its achievements this year. This sudden, yet relatively smooth, shift was made possible by the agility and resilience of UNICEF staff and the excellent support by the ICT team at all levels.  
 
The Enterprise Content Management was already an established collaboration site for all staff before the pandemic and was a key factor in the new set-up. The all-staff collaboration site supported the transition to teleworking by facilitating efficiency, collaboration, knowledge sharing, remote accessibility, and transparency. This will continue to be important as strict lockdown measures remain in most of the country for the foreseeable future.

"
EAPR,Thailand,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Capitalising on the COVID-19 experience to improve preparedness for the future 
 
A large part of UNICEF’s efforts in 2020 focused on COVID-19 response. Experience gained reveals a variety of lessons learned across all portfolios and aspects of work. 
 
One key lesson learned from COVID-19, in terms of programme coordination and response, is that despite being able to scale up an effective response and adapt as needs grew and changed, UNICEF emergency preparedness needs to be strengthened. UNICEF’s response was successful, due in large part to a strong sense of direction, cohesion, shared sense of purpose and the cross sectoral approach adopted by teams, a practice that should be built into future programming. Programmatic flexibility in fast-evolving situation aided, not only a timely response to the crisis but allowed for adaptation and adjustment to regular programme plans without losing sight of priorities.
 
Consideration should be given to the establishment of an emergency network among local actors including government, NGOs, local health facilities and health volunteer networks to improve understanding and timely outreach to vulnerable populations. Feedback from partners, including the private sector, UN partners and young people, could help to identify capacity gaps to be plugged for the future. 
 
The COVID-19 crisis underlined the need to re-enforce children’s rights as key success factors for the achievement of the SDGs, and not a luxury to be dispensed of in times of crisis or economic hardship. A more proactive approach may be needed, based on increasing public awareness, such as communicating deprivations and the violation of children’s rights to the public, to ensure children’s rights remain a continued imperative to consider, both in policy, processes, and budgetary allotments. 
 
Accelerating private sector partnerships 
The rapid pace of change, the number of actors engaging with CRB stakeholders, and limited resources calls for anchoring key strategies in partnerships, aligned visions and clear medium-long term joint action plans.

In this respect, UNICEF Thailand progressed private sector engagement efforts under the Business for Results (B4R) initiative, including supporting corporate sector COVID-19 response and adaptation. This and other ongoing cooperation with the business community provides a platform for further engagement to contribute towards children’s rights.
Child Rights and Business training in partnership with the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), carried out online in 2020, saw 10 of 28 companies trained in 2019 put forward their children’s rights impact assessment in their public communications, such as corporate sustainability reports.

With EU funding, partnership with Baan Dek Foundation on the Chiang Mai Framework for Action (CMFA) was developed to address child rights in the construction sector continued, demonstrating application of CMFA tools in work camps. Work on Family Friendly Practices (FFP) also commenced in 2020, with research on prevailing corporate FFP standards and practices, including identifying industry leading cases for future engagement. UNICEF also engaged in consultations with business organizations and companies on digital education and skills development, and adolescent employability in the post-COVID-19 context, to help inform future programming in these areas.

UNICEF shared guidance for employers with key private sector partners, covering flexible working arrangements, childcare support, and other good workplace practices in the context of COVID-19 aimed at achieving a better work-life balance. 

Promoting child protection, UNICEF shared guidance for mobile operators and online content providers for keeping children safe online during the pandemic; a major mobile operator (DTAC) integrated this guidance into their child safeguarding activities. UNICEF also developed and disseminated communication materials on child online protection and played a convening role in efforts to develop an e-learning child protection curriculum with child protection and justice professionals. 

Digitalisation 
The experience of the past 12 months has shown that the trend of digitalisation is no longer emerging but has now consolidated and must be a central consideration in future programming. Learning to adapt, devising new ways to interact, is a key success factor, not only during a time of crisis, but also in the longer term.

Lockdown measures put in place to halt the spread and mitigate the effects of COVID-19 triggered an end to face to face contacts, affected learning for 10 million children and highlighted the need for digital access in homes across the country. The experience highlighted the need for better understanding of marginalised groups, those with little access to remote learning or government support measures, and the importance of a more resilient and inclusive education system which can respond effectively to changing circumstances.

UNICEF quickly moved to provide RCCE information online, setting an example followed by government agencies who adapted access to social grants to online registration. Young people were encouraged to access COVID-19 prevention information, health care tips and counselling online, addressing some of the socio-economic fallout of the crisis. 

Traditional data collection methods and analysis was no longer possible due to social distancing measures, so new online or remote methods were devised by leveraging partnerships. The timely release of results became paramount given the fast-evolving situation on the ground and necessary policy changes to adapt to the new reality. 

Leveraging policy and financing to benefit children
Developments in 2020 revealed the importance of working with line ministries, particularly their planning departments, to bring child-related issues to the centre of national plans and strategies, while advocating in parallel for child-related issues with the NESDC, as the body responsible for reviewing ministerial projects and proposals. Ensuring a consultative and coordinated approach across government to promote ownership of initiatives is key to success. 
Ensuring the long-term sustainability of initiatives for children at the local level is only possible with adequate national level financing. Advocacy for increased government commitment to create a fiscal environment which provides a secure commitment to the improvement of quality services for children, young people and their families, both at a national and decentralised level, will be crucial for the next Country Programme. A better understanding of changes in national policy processes, along with various funding pathways for policies and proposals, will ensure increased leverage to access further funding for children. 

"
EAPR,Timor-Leste,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"2020 was a challenging year for regular programme implementation. However, challenges encouraged out-of-the-box thinking, which resulted in several innovations in UNICEF’s operations and service delivery for children and families. 
 
As the pandemic dramatically changed the operating environment, with the closure of schools and more generally with restrictions on face-to-face interactions, it also created opportunities to re-imagine service delivery. Eskola ba Uma is a case in point: over a short amount of time, UNICEF developed online learning materials, brought together the three telephone companies to support dissemination of learning content, and initiated online training for teachers. There were obstacles to do this in a country like Timor-Leste, including its low digital literacy, limited internet penetration and no optic fiber. An attempt to push this prior to the crisis would likely have faced resistance. But the crisis helped UNICEF and partners push for the ‘impossible,’ and in turn this success inspired others to picture ‘what could be’ in other areas.
 
More generally, the crisis has compelled all stakeholders to consider the potential of technology for programme implementation, in a country with a multitude of remote villages and where the frequency of disasters is likely to grow due to impact of climate change. In the child protection sector, UNICEF provided tablets to residential care institutions, to facilitate information exchange and access to remote support. Another illustration is the support UNICEF provided to the Ministry of Health to regularly monitor immunization coverage using an online platform, which helped identify poor performers and plan outreach activities during COVID-19. The Google platform data collection tools developed for immunization has been considered a good practice, and the MoH has adopted it more broadly for maternal and child health data collection and reporting. UNICEF also conducted its first online survey, using KoBoToolbox, to fill an information gap on the impact of COVID-19 on adolescents and youth. The 400 responses gathered (55% from female respondents) showed that within the space of a few years, online surveys have become a viable means of collecting data, which opens up opportunities for direct engagement with adolescents and youth. 
 
The crisis also exposed systemic weaknesses that had previously received limited attention, which has in turn helped build political will for action. The preparation of the Government’s COVID-19 cash transfer, for instance, was slowed down by poor population data. This in turn helped build momentum for implementing the transformative Unique ID initiative, which would improve identity management and facilitate State planning, as well as for strengthening civil registration and vital statistics. Similarly, the crisis helped focus attention on some of the long-standing gaps in the WASH sector and led to upgrading and improving WASH in health care facilities and in schools, as well as in critical locations such as points of entry and markets. While these needs have long been evident, they were routinely underfunded due to budget constraints. This also provided an opportunity to build toilets that consider gender and disability issues, and to design innovative, child-friendly handwashing stations.
 
A major challenge to a rapid and strong response to the pandemic were delays in procurement of critical COVID19 medical supplies – personal protective equipment, oxygen concentrators, and ventilators. Transporting these emergency supplies to Timor-Leste, given the huge global demand and logistics challenges, took several months. This experience points to the need to preposition supplies, which the Country Office undertook in late 2020, in consultation with UN and NGO partners. Such health, WASH and education supplies will help UNICEF respond quickly to crises, whose frequency and severity is expected to increase due to climate change. Looking forward, small, isolated countries like Timor-Leste might benefit from global UNICEF measures such as decentralized procurement and logistics to the regional and even sub regional level.
 
In a year of unprecedented challenges, the dedication and flexibility of UNICEF staff was a critical success factor in 2020. While working from home was the norm for part of the year, many UNICEF staff, as secondary front liners, continued to participate in essential face-to-face meetings and support Government activities on-site. Some staff were caught outside the country due to the borders closing and had to telework from different time zones and the Country Office had to re-purpose some staff who were in-country to fill critical needs. Solidarity also played out as the Country Office integrated youth volunteers. The office found new ways to maintain a strong sense of solidarity, with weekly all staff Zoom meeting and an office wide Whatsapp group.
 
However, this special situation took a human toll, and stress levels were high in 2020. The difficulty of securing medevac and visa arrangements, for COVID-19 or other critical medical care, remained a key concern throughout the year. To allay staff fears, the UNCT established a UN wellness centre, staffed with medical personnel, and staff were encouraged to avail themselves of psychological support services. Staff is UNICEF’s greatest asset, and the organization will continue all efforts to ensure staff safety and well-being.

"
EAPR,Vietnam,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"COVID-19 highlighted the need for virtual approaches to learning and training. Due to COVID-19 travel restrictions and bans on social gatherings, traditional face-to-face training was impossible. At the same time, enhanced awareness, knowledge and skills on hygiene and infection prevention and control were more important than ever before. UNICEF therefore developed and conducted virtual training in these areas for essential workers in the health and education sectors. All courses achieved ratings of over 8.5/10 (from participant satisfaction surveys) and showed significant increases in knowledge between pre- and post-tests. Not only was the training appreciated, it enabled a broader, more inclusive and cost effective reach to many more frontline workers. Likewise, much of the year’s child protection training was conducted online, including for 130 master trainers on psycho-social support and case management from social welfare, education and health sectors. These trainers are now training front line workers in those sectors. Such online training demonstrated great potential to be further utilized in routine programming.

Beyond traditional training, COVID-19 boosted digital literacy and education system transformation, with the use of virtual platforms for ASEAN events, monitoring visits, youth consultations and training becoming the norm. The urgency of online working took UNICEF and the government’s digital learning agenda to a higher level, in a rapid and inclusive manner.

The value of pre-positioning of emergency supplies was recognized in 2020, when COVID-19 and two natural disasters hit Viet Nam. UNICEF implemented a major supply response to the 3 emergencies that struck Viet Nam in 2020 – drought in Mekong Delta, floods in the central coastal region and COVID-19.  Supplies were predominantly for WASH – water filters, water tanks, soap and hand sanitizers, and dignity kits. In addition, personal protective equipment, nutrition supplies (screening tools and RUTF) and ECD kits were procured over the course of the year. Procurement was done through a mix of direct local procurement, cash transfer to partners, orders from Supply Division (SD) and off-shore contribution in-kind (CIK).  The year provided some valuable lessons learned on ensuring a rapid emergency supply response in Viet Nam. Regardless of the procurement method, there were genuine difficulties in getting supplies to target beneficiaries in a timely manner. These included: low commitment of government agencies to activate emergency protocols to fast-track administrative procedures; UNICEF’s heavy dependence on offshore supplies, resulting in long transit times; capacity of local suppliers to quickly produce and deliver supplies; and limited flexibility of internal processes and procedures, even during emergencies. Based on these lessons, the office is now planning the pre-positioning of supplies for more efficient and timelier emergency response.

UNICEF successfully leveraged major work on data this year as one of its key change strategies. This is especially relevant and effective in a MIC country like Viet Nam. We have learnt through clear evidence collected from tracking our website and social media that the government and the public are using data and evidence from UNICEF as a key source for public awareness and policy advocacy on all issues related to children. Our work on data include technical and financial support for the National Survey on Nutrition and the SDG Survey on Women and Children (MICS 6). MICS 6, conducted for the first time through virtual training by RO and HQ resource persons, will provide substantial data for SDG reporting and monitoring on women and children in Viet Nam, with additional data on water quality, Demographic and Health Survey indicators and broader coverage of major cities and key ethnic minority groups. UNICEF supported the government to appraise and endorse the first National List of Children Indicators, in line with the SDGs. 
 
Delivering programming in minority languages is critical to effectively supporting and engaging with ethnic minority children and parents. This requires communication materials, training and learning programmes and social services are made available in ethnic minority languages and are delivered by ethnic minority staff and collaborators who speak the language and understand the local context. This was a key lesson of the holistic parenting programme, reviewed in 2020 and the COVID-19 response.

Some key factors drove this year’s growth in social media. Investment in the creation of innovative, engaging, fact-based professional multimedia assets tailored to platforms and targeted to specific audiences boosted engagement at a time when people were spending more time online and looking for trusted information. Adapting content to ethnic minority languages and sign language also ensured that messages reached and engaged the most vulnerable children.

Collaboration with influencers allowed millions of new users to be reached, and the influencers mobilized their fans to share life-saving information in engaging and entertaining ways. The combination of engaging content and strategic social media management positioned UNICEF as a trusted voice for children and enhanced the UNICEF brand. The 2020 Brand Barometer Survey in Viet Nam showed that UNICEF was one of the two best known and most trusted organizations in the development and humanitarian sector, with 93 per cent total brand awareness and a level of trust at 87 per cent. 

A strategic approach and investment in digital communication changed the way UNICEF Viet Nam works in the digital space and strengthened its presence in a highly competitive market. UNICEF reached, engaged, and influenced every day a fast-growing audience, consolidating its presence as a thought leader in the digital world. The integrated approach to communication proved effective in supporting C4D efforts, while also enhancing the brand, engaging an increasing number of supporters, and creating a favourable environment for policy advocacy. In a context where there is growing mistrust of information, UNICEF’s brand and high trust by the population contributed to reinforcing public health messages.

ECAR,Albania,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The complex programming environment triggered flexible, innovative and adaptable programming in Albania. Measures that restricted movement and gatherings to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus presented new challenges, as well as opportunities for programming.

Adapting safe outreach methods. UNICEF supported the government and partners with the introduction of mobile and rapid response child protection teams to reach the most vulnerable groups who were stuck at home. PPE was secured for teachers, health workers, and social and child protection workers to support continuation of service provision in a safe environment. Additional support provided to shelters for survivors of violence allowed for broader accommodation of survivors and the introduction of extra-hours of childcare helped Mothers with more flexible time arrangement at work. Child helplines and online counselling services became central as the need for such services rapidly increased and addressed movement restrictions and safety of helpline staff. UNICEF increased its support to the online professional MHPSS service, allowing more people to work in shifts. The number of beneficiaries tripled within 5–6 months.

Use of technology was applied in numerous ways. UNICEF supported key government partners at national and sub-national levels by facilitating access to and use of new technologies for coaching, communicating, organising online exchange sessions (including on breastfeeding, IPC and hygiene promotion), and online parliamentary sessions on the socio-impact of COVID-19 on children. UNICEF increased the use of the U-report platform to ensure engagement of adolescents in important processes and introduced telephone interviews. With the development and scaled-up digital, disability friendly, interactive learning platform (akademi.al) UNICEF secured the continued learning of more than half a million children.

Pioneering new approaches is another significant lesson learned. UNICEF championed the work programmatically in a barren and unexplored area of online child abuse. Having little overall in-depth experience, lack of reliable examples from other parts of the world and almost non-existent political buy-in nationally, UNICEF, by galvanising this particular area of child protection, worked and consistently invested in its exploration, gaining first-hand direct experience of the subject matter, gathering evidence previously explored, and as a result established itself as a knowledge broker and thematic lead nationally and regionally. Noteworthy that gender gap when exploring children’s online wellbeing, with girls being subject to more restrictive parenting than boys. UNICEF and the Municipality of Tirana introduced Bibliotech Talks to inspire girls and women in Tech. UNICEF’s thematic reports and expert feedback on Internet safety for children are fed into the analysis of the EU and the US and UK governments.

Continued focus on evidence generation and consistent use. Aligned with corporate policy requirements, the Evaluation of the UNICEF in Albania Programme 2016–2021 assessed UNICEF’s performance and contribution towards national development goals, including a thorough engagement of national stakeholders to contribute towards its completion. The strategic decision to keep it focused, targeting the most significant and outstanding issues under evaluation, helped to finalise the evaluation in time and for it to be used to inform the design of the Programme Strategic Notes and draft a new CPD.
UNICEF in Albania concluded the Evaluation of UNICEF’s contribution to the normative framework of social care services reform during 2013–2019. The evaluation process managed to trigger constructive discussion among various stakeholders working in the field. This was made possible also through the strategic composition of the Evaluation Reference group as diverse and extended, to include representatives of national and local governmental stakeholders (various sectors), EU and UN agencies. The interactions and discussions led to government consent for the revised UN Joint Workplan 2020–2021, where most of the evaluation recommendations are integrated. Following Corporate Guidelines, the Management Response Plan was compiled in coordination with relevant staff members, and its implementation closely monitored by CO management.

Partnering with the State Agency for Child Rights and Protection to finalise the Visualisation Platform for 58 child-specific Statistics, UNICEF transformed entirely the modality of how institutional (administrative) data are assembled, accessed and presented. The platform constitutes an innovation, considering that few Albanian authorities have invested so far in such tools. The platform and the stretched process for its development was converted by UNICEF and the State Agency into a journey of improving the quality of data reported.

"
ECAR,Armenia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing lockdown, forced offices around the world to shift to teleworking modality. UNICEF Armenia utilized different online platforms (Zoom, Microsoft Teams, etc.), as well as supported creating digital learning resources, which ensured continuity of regular and emergency programming. Such changes forced us also to move to digital signatures, which helped speed up work processes, and save paper. We introduced flexible working modalities which, to some extent, improved the work-life balance of the team. All these changes are expected to affect the office-work culture in the future. The preparedness investments made in previous years, including through the EPP, staff emergency trainings and contingency planning exercises, allowed the office to rapidly scale-up its humanitarian response to the impact of military hostilities in NK conflict zone. 
In cooperation with professional associations and CSOs, UNICEF introduced a new modality of continuous support to social service workforce (SSW) professionals – an online group psycho-social support (PSS), anti-burnout sessions and individual supervision for SSWs, as well as professional guidance through helpline and provision of coaching and mentoring. This modality allowed to cover a big number of professionals in a short timeframe, enhanced local mental health and PSS capacity and established support to networks of professionals at the community level, including hard-to-reach remote communities in borderline regions. 
Following a feasibility study on cash preparedness through the social protection system in Armenia in 2017, UNICEF raised awareness on shock-responsive social protection and studied other countries’ experiences and various outline modalities of support, including through the establishment of a dedicated Cash Coordination working group within DMCT. UNICEF, in collaboration with the Government and development partners, embarked on a series of workstreams aimed at strengthening elements of the social protection system, including policy and institutional frameworks, evidence generation, programme design and delivery systems, to prepare the system for future shock response. These efforts positioned UNICEF as a leading partner in social protection within the dual crises, and also informed our timely and sequenced actions of development and implementation of COVID-19 and NK response plans. UNICEF coordinated development partners’ COVID-19 responses through liaison with MoLSA, directly supported the Government to develop the tools and systems for rapid assessment (jointly with UNDP and WFP), and implemented complementary cash support measures for families of children living with disabilities through the Government’s Treasury system. UNICEF facilitated the design and compliance of Government’s NK response plan with planned responses of Cash WG and supported needs’ assessment of families. Reduced oversight of the performance of intervention and a reduced role in programme design decisions were the main challenges encountered. To mitigate these risks, UNICEF is negotiating on behalf of Cash WG to access the personal information of beneficiary households to implement post-distribution monitoring. As a result of all these efforts, UNICEF positioned itself as a credible partner both with the Government and development partners, securing a revamped social policy portfolio in the UNSDCF and crisis response plans.
Despite the dual crises, UNICEF succeeded in developing its adolescent portfolio in Armenia, using new and creative ways of engagement. UNICEF established an online platform for adolescent girls and boys to engage with experts and policymakers and finding solutions for climate change impact on biodiversity in Armenia, discuss the importance of climate change, environmental education and gender aspects, and how they can collectively contribute to reducing the impact of disasters and adopt measures to build resilient communities. In an interactive online PechaKucha format event, young advocates raised their voices for joint action on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning in line with the Sustainable Development Goals. On International Youth Day, over 50 adolescent girls and boys, including some with disabilities, presented strategies and suggested tools for meaningful participation in policy and community development through education. Voiced out questions and recommendations were consolidated into the recommendations for revised national education curricula to ensure its compliance with 21st Century skills and child-centred learning. Through these actions, adolescents practically applied the skills that they developed with UNICEF support overtime, including influencing decision-makers and education practitioners. As part of the COVID-19 response, adolescents from different regions were mobilized to share their stories on staying at home and keeping their mood up during COVID-19 lockdown featuring their stories online on UNICEF channels. UNICEF will build on these achievements to prepare a new generation of adolescents, including from disadvantaged families and those with disabilities, ready to engage, voice out their opinions to bring positive change in their communities. The past experience of advancing adolescent programming in Armenia identified the need to establish and capacitate a core group of adolescent influencers who can later lead on the adolescent advocacy and support UNICEF efforts in advancing the rights of young girls and boys and empowering them as community change-makers. This lesson learnt will largely shape CO programming in upcoming CPD cycle.  
Gender transformative programming emerged from the need to tackle gender stereotypes and narrowly defined roles of girls and boys, which was a key driver of gender-biased sex selection in Armenia resulting in the loss of over 4000 unborn girls in the last 8 years. Research revealed that the unconscious biases of men in terms of son preference drives gender-biased sex selection. It showed how unconscious processes can give rise to stereotypes that also pressure women to perform to these stereotypes. Programmes that effectively influence the gradual shift of norms and changes in behaviours have proven to be the best way of effecting a change in attitudes and beliefs which perpetuate these stereotypes and gender-based roles. Therefore, in partnership with Public TV of Armenia and Teach for Armenia Educational Foundation, UNICEF conducted a number of Communication for Change (C4D) initiatives, including the production of edutainment programming for changing gender stereotypes through gender transformative activities, and working with teachers as key agents of gender norm transfer and recycling and introducing gender-transformative teaching methods in schools. UNICEF will further advocate for integration of relevant modules to tackle gender biases in teaching within the reforms of in-service teacher trainings and education development policy.
"
ECAR,Azerbaijan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The unprecedented disruption to, and constraints upon, delivery of regular programmes that characterised the greater part of the year required a dramatic refocusing of UNICEF’s approaches in management, operations, programme delivery and monitoring.
 
The transition to full-time teleworking for all staff and consultants from March 2020 saw the Country Office utilise information technologies to support remote operations, including establishment of “mini-offices” for key staff with basic equipment to facilitate day to day administrative tasks. While electronic systems where used wherever possible, for example for routine signatories and bank processing, the global trend for electronic payments systems and administration did not always reflect local regulations and processes, requiring a flexible approach at the country level. Prolonged periods of quarantine combined with closure of schools and day-care facilities required a more flexible approach to staff working arrangements, with the Country Office introducing a weekly “housekeeping day” free of formal meetings, engagements or internal deadlines to allow staff to balance better their work tasks and household obligations. The office took full advantage of the technical support provided by specialists in the UNICEF Regional Office to enable staff to access professional guidance beyond the immediate team, and benefited from advice and one-to-one support from the Regional Staff Counsellor to mitigate pressures faced by colleagues during a nine-month period of isolated working.
 
Programme delivery was enhanced by new approaches to delivery, notably through the use of online platforms to, for example, connect social workers and vulnerable families, provide positive parenting and early childhood development initiatives for families at home, design and deliver remote basic and early learning programming, maintain life skills and related training opportunities for young people and accelerate vital public health information and communication. While the move of many programme activities to a virtual format ensured that most planned activities could be continued throughout the year, the digital divide experienced by many families – especially those in lower income groups – was highlighted and remains an issue that requires concerted focus if online programming is to become more commonplace in the future. While virtual programme delivery did enable many services and initiatives reach more people in some sectors, the challenges of equitable access and quality of programme content remain to be fully measured. 
 
The constraints created by the COVID-19 pandemic on face-to-face contacts with families and communities, with travel restrictions in place for most of the year, encouraged more use of digital approaches to collect data and evidence in support of programme design and adaptation. In particular, the timely establishment of audience telephone surveying in response to the pandemic enabled the Country Office to gather a wide range of up to date information on household perceptions and practices that was used not only for UNICEF’s own programming but was shared systematically with government and other partners to inform wider decision making. For the first time, UNICEF also introduced regular social media listening systems, which generated real-time insights to common and emerging issues being discussed across a broad public audience and created better opportunities to identify trends, pinpoint possible misinformation and gaps in knowledge related to COVID-19.
 
With limited physical access to communities, the Country Office also adapted its traditional direct field monitoring for quality assurance to a remote footing. Increased use was made of regular contacts with implementing partners through telephone calls and messaging groups, alongside regular “human interest” reporting that confirmed implementation status and impact on beneficiaries.
 
The investments made in previous years in emergency preparedness and response capacities within both the Country Office and several partners demonstrated its value, notably following the escalation of the conflict in and beyond the Nagorno-Karabakh region in the last quarter of the year. UNICEF was able to engage quickly with key partners to agree priority areas of intervention, especially in the areas of psychosocial support and mine risk education and begin implementation of responses in a relatively short timeframe. The response to both the conflict escalation and the COVID-19 pandemic did identify remaining gaps in the supply sector, with shortages in available stocks of basic humanitarian supplies within the local market. The experience of supply management during the year also highlighted the importance of a strong working relationship between the Country Office supply and administration team and the national customs authorities to facilitate rapid import of essential supplies. 
 
The overarching lesson learned from the challenging experience of programming in 2020 was the importance of flexible implementation approaches, and the supportive engagement of partners in enabling regular programming to be maintained through an emergency context. In many cases, UNICEF was able to continue delivering routine programming – for example skills training for young people, early childhood development, nutrition counselling for mothers and social worker support for vulnerable families – by utilising online and other remote structures and adapting programme content to the prevailing context. The willingness of donor and implementing partners to support the change in modalities ensured that overall progress against programme targets could be maintained, despite the constraints, and the approach represented an important step towards blending development and emergency programming – this will be significant as the country moves back towards a more regular developmental environment in the next year. The role of civil society took on growing importance in community-focused programming, with UNICEF increasing the number of its non-government partners by over 55 per cent compared to 2019.
 
The opportunity created by the COVID-19 pandemic to invest in strengthening of professional capacities in notably the health and education sectors will also contribute to longer term system reforms and enhancements. Similarly, the experience of transitioning some programming implementation to more online formats, combined with the inevitable increase in digital literacy amongst the general population resulting from the quarantine periods, will create new opportunities to expand outreach to key audiences in some programme areas longer-term, although the issue of accessibility and affordability of digital connections for lower-income households will remain a challenge to be addressed
"
ECAR,Belarus,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In 2020, the Country Office (CO) had to substantially change its programming, operations and resource mobilization due to COVID-19 and compounded by the political turmoil following the August elections.
While Belarus held digitalization as a key strategic development goal, defining it as an SDG accelerator, lessons from 2020 underscored the need to build sectors’ capacities on how to use technologies and revealed how technology can amplify opportunities for social inclusion and access to services.
 
With COVID-19, technology became a critical tool for people’s daily interactions from connection with relatives and friends to obtainment of services and information. However, a large portion of people did not have the skills to transfer quickly to online interaction. The office took significant steps to train partners on online approaches and enhance its own efforts through new online formats such as webinars, chatbots and talk shows. These experiences showed how amplified use of technology in information and services create opportunities for vulnerable child groups such as children with disabilities to be better included in their communities and among their peers. UNICEF promoted with partners use of technology as a key instrument for resource mobilization, as well as e-counselling in the health sector and introduction of online education approaches for blended learning in secondary schools.
 
Due to the difficult epidemiological situation of COVID-19, attendance at early intervention centres, providing medico-social services for young children with special education needs and disabilities, dropped by 60 - 65% over spring 2020. However, continuity of regular interventions for these children’s development remained critical. These families were becoming more isolated, dealing with their children’s issues on their own, avoiding traveling to the centres to reduce risks of infection. While the Ministry of Health’s Order No. 1270 (dated November 27, 2018) provided for the possibility of teleworking with families, ECI center specialists lacked the skills to implement such operational models, combined with a scarcity of the required technical equipment. The situation of COVID-19 magnified the need for this approach. 
UNICEF in partnership with lead ECI centres is now developing an e-counselling training programme with roll-out in 2021. While the approach will enhance accessibility of children with disabilities to the ECI services during the COVID-19 pandemic, it will also create the tools for greater outreach to families for ‘routine’ services where the children are supported in their daily environments (e.g. home, on playground, etc.).
The experience in schools revealed the potential role for remote learning. While schools did not officially move to remote learning, UNICEF surveys in spring 2020 showed that approximately 40% of children did not attend classes due to fear of COVID-19 infection. Towards the end of 2020, the Ministry of Education started working to create opportunities for distance and online learning opportunities in primary and secondary schools though the establishment of a specific educational platform. In this capacity, UNICEF has also initiated partnership with the Belarusian Academy of Post-Graduate Education to create a training programme to build teachers’ skills on online learning as this shift requires different approaches in presentation and interaction with students than in classes conducted offline. As with the integration of ECI e-counselling, enhancement of online learning tools could strengthen in the longer term the education system’s capacities for blended learning to respond to the challenges of delivering inclusive quality education for all children, as well as equip students and teachers with the 21st century skills and competences they need to develop their full potential. 
Increased parenting and adolescent-related programming in digital media platforms should also be applied in future to maximize outreach and impact. Digital outreach, blended with face-to-face services for primary healthcare (e.g. e-counselling) and education responses, can increase children’s and families’ access to services and foster greater inclusion.
The rapidly changing environment has highlighted the importance to equip adolescents and youth with online learning skills and access to information for coping in crisis situations. UPSHIFT methodology will continue to be used to build social innovation skills among adolescents and youth, motivating them for development of creative ideas on how to promote mental health and life skills through social networks, apps, online courses and e-platforms.
Another important takeaway from 2020 was the need for the office to have strengthened digital media presence and programme delivery. Social media has traditionally provided important platforms for child rights dialogue and advocacy, yet the COVID-19 situation reinforced the need for the office to use actively digital platforms to deliver programmes and enhance child-related messages to the public. The office’s diversification of online outreach resulted in a 35% increase in social media followers, in turn allowing amplification of messages during COVID-19. The office also advocated to government partners for greater use of digital tools for outreach on child rights, resulting in the Government’s prioritization of interactive, innovative technology approaches (e.g. online counselling or chatbots) within the 2021-2025 National Programme on the Health of the Nation and Democratic Security.
Overall, the necessity for accelerated digital responses for information outreach and services called for by the COVID-19 response created the lessons for future programming with a broader integration of technological solutions that can increase children’s and families’ access to an array of services that are critical for their health, well-being, social inclusion and development."
ECAR,Bosnia and Herzegovina,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"For 2020 the following key lessons learned and innovations are worth highlighting: 
 
1.     Delivering results even during the COVID-19 ‘new normal’
 
Since the first cases of COVID-19 were recorded in BiH in March 2020, UNCEF quickly adapted its working modalities. Most of the interaction with government and other partners went virtual as of March. After an initial phase of adjusting to ‘the new normal’, the majority of the planned activities for 2020 were adjusted to focus on the COVID-19 response, while at the same time many of the activities of the regular programme continued to be delivered, including also the support to refugees and migrants. Despite several delays the overall delivery of results remained efficient and effective in 2020. 
 
2.     Innovating and adapting to change rather than ‘business as usual’ 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic prompted a number of innovative approaches. Digitalization became new normal, and the application of online, hence low-cost and often more time-efficient working modalities proved to be generally effective in engaging with all partners and delivering programmatic results. However, there were many challenges, especially as government institutions were not prepared to switch to alternative working modalities such as in the education sector when schools were closed from mid-March to the end of June and teaching had to go online. While schools in some areas managed the online learning relatively well, others faced significant problems which affected children, in particular those that were already disadvantaged. Many partners will require continued support to adapt their working modalities. One of the opportunities is that online trainings allow a broader group of professionals to benefit from learning initiatives, while also significantly reducing costs.  
 
3.     Rapid data generation during the COVID-19 pandemic
 
Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF initiated several rapid assessments to generate evidence on how the pandemic affected children and their families. Most were designed in-house and in consultation with key partners, demonstrating that such assessments can be done within a relatively limited amount of time. The following assessments and studies were conducted: a brief Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) study on COVID-19 response; two Rapid Needs Assessments in the education sector (March and June); two rounds of Social Impact Assessments of COVID-19 through (virtual) household surveys in July-August and November-December 2020, in collaboration with UNDP; rapid impact assessments in the social protection sector in five cantons in FBiH. UNICEF continued to use U-Report to better understand young people’s views, ideas and experiences regarding the pandemic, such as about the quality of online education. 
 
4.     More recognition of the need for shock-responsive social protection
 
While the focus was on the COVID-19 response, systems strengthening was an integral part in all programme areas to address future emergencies. COVID-19 raised the importance and recognition of the need for a comprehensive shock-responsive social protection (SRSP) approach among government counterparts and other partners. This generated a renewed commitment for further investments in institutionalizing SRSP in the country, including multi-/hazard analysis and planning that covers a variety of risks including health risks. 
 
5.     Reimagining education for the future
 
As schools were closed in mid-March 2020 when the number of COVID-19 cases increased rapidly and ‘online learning’ became part of the common vocabulary. With all the turmoil that the pandemic brought along, it has become clear that this crisis may be a once in a lifetime opportunity to make a big leap forward in the education sector and improve the scope and quality of learning for children in BiH. The imperative of leaving no one behind means that the pandemic is a real opportunity for BiH education authorities to not only ‘build back better’ but to also make further efforts to reduce inequities by ‘building back equal’. Speeding up digital transformation in education is one key component of this. Broadcast media can be part of a multi-pronged approach to the alternative delivery of preschool education content and it already demonstrated several advantages during 2020. While TV and radio lack interactivity, parents and caregivers can address this shortcoming by engaging more with their children to discuss broadcast educational content, supplemented by printed materials.
 
6.     Continuing child rights monitoring in challenging times
 
While the COVID-19 pandemic and the November 2020 local elections delayed progress in several areas, UNICEF in partnership with the Ministry of Human Rights and Refugees, other government institutions, NGOs and children themselves continued to monitor the situation of children. Government developed a first-ever Action Plan for Monitoring the Committee on the Rights of the Child Concluding Observations for the period 2020-2024 and this will be implemented going forward. The Situation Analysis of Children, updated by UNICEF in 2019-2020, will be further updated in 2021. UNICEF conducted a number of rapid assessments to generate evidence on how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected children and their families. 
           
7.     Enhancing the nexus between the humanitarian and development programme in the response to the refugee and migrant situation
While the Balkan route has long faced management and protection challenges, 2020 exacerbated these difficulties through the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent border closures within and along the external borders of the EU, including between BiH and Croatia. The ensuing desperation among migrants and refugees, has fueled political tensions, exacerbated a shelter crisis, and led to a rise in violence and confrontations. At the same time, the fall 2020 EU attempts to introduce a set of legislative proposals that would address migration and asylum challenges comprehensively, has mostly stalled. UNICEF will need to continue assisting Government in the provision of immediate humanitarian assistance, while further strengthening the nexus between the humanitarian and development programme.
 
Going forward in 2021, the first year of the new Country Programme for 2021-2025, UNICEF will use the  evidence and lessons learned in 2020 to inform programme interventions and strategies for the COVID-19 response, including gender response, cross-sectoral work in different areas and the humanitarian response to the refugee and migrant situation. 
"
ECAR,Bulgaria,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"While acknowledging the significant challenges of the COVID-19 crisis globally and in Bulgaria the country office (CO) outlines several lessons learnt in the process of achieving the results in 2020: 
COVID-19 emergency:   
The COVID-19 crisis being a health emergency resulted in increased morbidity and mortality and stressed the health system and other institutions in Bulgaria. In addition, the response measures impacted various sectors of Bulgaria’s economy contributing to increased unemployment and exacerbating poverty. The crisis contributed to further marginalization of the most excluded and vulnerable children. Child rights monitoring was particularly challenged as most institutions and communities were inaccessible to civil society and other monitoring agencies.  To address the challenges, UNICEF mobilized resources and encouraged partners to apply innovative ways of gathering data and for information sharing including using remote channels and applying de-centralized approaches. 
Using different online platforms, the CO carried out several rapid assessments including collecting behavioral insights data which was a game-changer in informing a rapid COVID-19 awareness and prevention response,  policy development and service design and delivery. 
To closely monitor the situation of all children, institutions were supported to undertake more regular on-line surveys and inform on progress and bottlenecks. This unprecedented situation provided the engine to drive coordination and efficiency of information sharing resulting in a gradual adjustment to regular virtual meetings with service providers and authorities. Remote access, including complaints and case management, were strengthened and ensured through digital means like phone, email and online platforms. New telephone lines and chat-boots were introduced providing more accessible channels of information sharing, and were more attractive to adolescents and young people. 
Access to closed facilities remained challenging especially for children’s institutions and receptions centers for migrants and refugees. Partners reported that more refugees became unemployed and at higher risk of becoming homeless and/or victims of violence, including GBV and sexual violence. Mainstream education and access to state health services is still a problem for asylum-seeking children. UNICEF and partners will need to advocate for and find more reliable ways to monitor the situation of these often ""invisible"" children. 
Measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 including Lockdowns constrained the delivery of face-to-face parenting support activities. This highlights the need to define diverse approaches for ensuring continuous support for parenting and early learning of children, particularly those from the most vulnerable groups. 
The COVID-19 crisis fostered/energized the long-awaited digitalization, especially in education by enhancing technology-based innovations/solutions such as virtual classrooms, collaboration tools and development of online resources, including for children with disabilities through UNICEF support. 
The lock-down and closing of kindergartens and schools stimulated effective collaboration between teachers and parents, particularly of young children and children from vulnerable groups with limited access to online education.  UNICEF took every opportunity to engage the MoES and provided current evidence, global tools and advocated for reopening of schools and will continue to advocate for innovations to be maintained and improved beyond the COVID-19 response.
Services Modelling:
UNICEF Bulgaria has developed and evaluated various service models to demonstrate implementation of policies defined by Government and some activities have been mainstreamed and scaled using the state budget, however, it is necessary to develop joint exit strategy with relevant partners for the remaining services.  This should lead to gradual hand-over of model-services to Government while making efficient and relevant impact on the legislative framework, ensuring sustainability and national scale-up with guaranteed local financial resources.
The CO observes that in a dynamic political context with constantly changing priorities, modelling should be integrated into existing structures and provisions, strengthening and expanding their capacities to deliver support to children not establishing new services requiring additional financing. In that regard, as part of the EU Child Guarantee Phase III, UNICEF implements a project aimed at improving the living conditions and increasing access and use of integrated services for children with disabilities and children living in precarious family situations through building on existing services and expanding their capacities. 
In future no new models should be encouraged, and the office should consolidate results from the “field” and accelerate advocacy at national level with strong advocacy on investing in effectively public finance for children. 
In addition, partnerships with youth as agents of change and with Business as policy influencers is crucial for positioning and reimagining the relevance of UNICEF within an UMIC in the EU context.
 
Partnerships for results 
Engagement with the business sector requires a change in narrative from mainly fundraising to Shared-Value-Partnerships and co-creation with stronger positioning of UNICEF as an expert partner. In that regard, the office is exploring approaches of engaging with and influencing the agenda of business associations, the stock exchange  and chambers of commerce.
The economic instability in the country, the impact of the pandemic on the performance of companies and growing unemployment rate in combination with increasing competition on the local fundraising market and decreasing level of trust in charity organizations had a negative impact on the overall fundraising results.  However, businesses reacted rapidly and creatively to support the health sector and to partner with UNICEF to deliver in-kind donations to the most vulnerable children and families. The office used this opportunity to position UNICEF as knowledge leader providing trusted global information and advancing the business for result agenda. 
The crisis enabled the office to test the flexibility of Private Sector Fundraising  approaches and used this experience to mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on fundraising. Since F2F fundraising was curtailed an enhanced focus on supporters’ engagement and retention and diversification of fundraising channels including digital and direct mailing was applied successfully. Furthermore, improved planning, whole-office engagement and integration of advocacy and fundraising goals led to improved results from integrated campaigns, particularly raising visibility of UNICEF and advocating for children living with disabilities. However, acquisition of new major corporate partners and increasing individual pledges should remain the main strategy in 2021 with an innovative corporate fundraising strategy. Over 40 celebrities  and influencers were successfully engaged to advocate and support fundraising for UNICEF and  this experience will  be used for future efforts."
ECAR,Croatia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"As a result of advocacy activities within the business community and based on the newly established partnership with the Croatian Office of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and Croatian Chamber of Economy, the first-ever award for responsible business practices towards children “CSR Index” was introduced as part of the national CSR awards in 2020. It is based on UNICEF’s methodology for assessing the integration of CR into business policies and practices. It will help raise the visibility of children’s rights in business and serve as an inspiration to Croatian companies to implement responsible practices and initiatives focused on children.
Due to the epidemiological situation and earthquakes that hit Croatia in 2020, most of UNICEF programmes had to be adapted and moved to an online format. This also proved to be an opportunity for reaching the furthest behind children. As the burden of mental health conditions among adolescents has increased, programmes related to developing socio-emotional skills of adolescent boys and girls to build their resilience were not sufficient. In light of this, and taking gender needs in consideration, the CO initiated a programme for young people to promote positive adolescent development by expanding the quality of online support and adequate digital content for young people across Croatia. 
Thus, UNICEF supported the 12th Children’s Rights Festival, successfully redesigned to an online format, preserving and expanding its unique inclusive character and mainly focusing on COVID-19 pandemic, mental health, media literacy, enabling engagement of a record number of 27,107 children and adolescents (55% girls and 45% boys), which represented an increase of 130 % compared to 2019.  It also included 123 children with disabilities, who participated in offline and online events, workshops, debates and were able to watch films adapted for the visually and hearing impaired. Public awareness on children’s rights was increased through a media partnership with the Croatian National Television which broadcasted trailer-ads and 3 films from the Festival, 69 media articles and a social media campaign, reaching 272,000 people on Facebook (267% increase compared to 2019). The Media Literacy Days, also organized in an online format, focused on providing educational resources for distance learning and the national social media campaign, supporting parents, children, and educational professionals in understanding the media, critical thinking, recognizing fake news, tackling misinformation and online violence prevention. Media experts and educators produced 12 videos used for distance schooling and 4 new educational packages hence 4,731 children and adolescents participated in 69 offline/online events. Web platform reached a record of 339,000 users (300% increase in the age group 18-24). The educational content was used over 1 million times and 3,000 teachers applied to a dedicated Facebook group. UNICEF strengthened its position as one of the key stakeholders in media literacy education through the strong media presence and cross-border knowledge-sharing. UNICEF co-created educational materials were taken over by Agencies for Electronic Media counterparts in Serbia and Bosnia & Herzegovina, while the Croatian concept of Media Literacy Days was used in Montenegro.UNICEF also reconfirmed its readiness to respond to shocks, emergencies, and crisis – most of the communications, partnerships and external relations required innovations, quick decisions and adjustments to new circumstances hence they were all moved to the digital and online space.  Specific circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic prevented the realization of public events, which diminished opportunities for offline engagement, while media saturation with COVID-19 and earthquakes related topics made it challenging to penetrate the key media. To mitigate the negative impacts on advocacy and programme results for children, UNICEF developed concepts for digital campaigns, redesigned its online platforms, and established new partnerships with experts, media and public influencers to provide the most relevant content and support for families, children and adolescents in the COVID-19 context. Key public events were redesigned to virtual formats supported by expanded digital communication activities, which opened new pathways for growth. The best example is the virtual Milky Way humanitarian race, which created unprecedented public interest growing in the number of supporters by more than three times compared to 2019 and securing wide support of key national high-level decision-makers. Accordingly, the CO confirmed its ability to synergize communications, advocacy and partnerships, responding to innovative challenges and emergencies and preserving its recognizability, brand and reputation.In terms of resource mobilization, the unprecedented pandemic situation has brought about changes in the habits of citizens which may provide opportunities for the future, as digital channels were in use more than ever. Still, these same changes pose a risk to our established fundraising channels (F2F, school collections, etc.). and a risk assessment will have to take place to examine how to reach future income targets and innovate in digital areas should the pandemic measures remain in place for the longer term. The major innovation of organizing the virtual race brought many benefits and allowed the CO to hold a truly inclusive sporting event and engage more than 8,500 participants for improving the living conditions of children with disabilities and promoting social inclusion and equal rights for every child in Croatia.  Of adults participating, 66% were women and 34% men, and of children participating, 45% were girls and 55% boys."
ECAR,"ECARO, Switzerland",Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The key lessons learned for 2020 concerns emergency preparedness and risk programming. COVID-19 revealed, for instance, the weakness of infection prevention and control in health facilities and the need for strengthening health system resilience to be better prepared for future disasters. Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) in health and education facilities also needs to be improved. The pandemic highlighted the importance of close cooperation between humanitarian and development agencies and governments to provide strong support in fighting the crisis. In addition, the fact that the coronavirus response has required UNICEF to work closely with a wide range of partners further underlines the vital need for strong coordination to leverage combined strengths and  synergies for a focused response. The COVID-19 outbreak also accelerated a shift to online modalities, to reach a greater number of children and youth, as well as frontline responders. 


The increased involvement of  business in support of the COVID-19 response highlighted the need for capacity development within UNICEF to work with this sector. Networked ways of working will  be required, in which agencies such as UNICEF established innovative partnerships with development institutions, private companies, local communities, and new philanthropists, to benefit from their skills, scale, access, supply chains and sustainable business models. It also helped UNICEF develop competencies, and establish innovative systems learning from best practice examples.  In the flash appeal for the COVID-19 response,  private companies participated to supply PPE and critical medical equipment. Businesses' flexible processes enabled the rapid mobilization of resources, enhanced interagency/intersectoral coordination, and facilitated the free transport. 


Partnerships with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) helped to accelerate ECARO's engagement in data-driven education planning and management. However, intellectual property rights have limited UNICEF's visibility in and contribution to the joint work and products. Accordingly, the partnership agreement was amended to ensure property rights are shared equally by UNICEF and OECD. 


Ongoing regional ECE initiatives demonstrate that the development of rigorous, flexible and multi-country products requires significant investment, relevant staff skills and adequate time for country-level inputs and testing to ensure the innovations and regional products are relevant and sufficiently flexible to fit varied country contexts.These efforts have resulted in economies of scale and improved tailored support to countries, strengthening initiative take-up and sustainability. UNICEF has sought to build on promising COVID response innovations and embed these into ongoing ECE system strengthening and reform efforts, such as Learning Passport platforms, and training hubs for ECE practitioners, etc.  


UNICEF is increasingly working with the European Union to influence the EU's external and internal agenda for children. Many EU Child Guarantee Phase III approaches could be promoted outside the EU, especially in accession countries. 


To promote the childcare reform agenda, UNICEF has developed and widely disseminated the White Paper on the use of small residential care, which also helps dialogue on the use of residential care for children. Children in boarding school are the next grey area that UNICEF will address through a similar paper developed in 2021, using the same development process, reaching consensus with an external expert reference group. 


UNICEF has built the capacity to engage around the rights of children returning from conflict zones, mainly Iraq and Syria. This has benefited from coordination across regions, countries, and with HQ colleagues. A coherent response has been built through collaboration with governments and the network of child rights ombudspersons in the Russian Federation and Central Asia.


Obstacles to distance learning and skills-building during COVID-19 included lack of access to devices and inequities in learning contexts.  Efforts have been made to bridge the gap. Despite the negative impacts of COVID-19 on youth employment opportunities and participation, youth were activated and engaged in responding to the pandemic and in resilience and recovery plans. The digital engagement generated new opportunities for youth leadership and initiatives in countering climate degradation, gender stereotypes, racial prejudice, hate speech, and social exclusion. 


The Future We Want (FWW) campaign was launched in Italy in 2020 to give voice to young migrants, refugees, and adolescents on their experience of lockdown and vision of a post-COVID-19 future. Over 2,000 adolescents participated in an online survey and elaborated a 10-point Manifesto in June, and the campaign was continuously adapted to ongoing developments. The final phase of the campaign was a call to action for young people through adaptation and delivery by school teachers and/or trainers of the FWW content into online classes, reaching more than 1,200 students all over the country.


Gender capacity building has improved across the region with resources and practical sessions. There is a greater focus on gender-transformative programming, strengthening gender leadership and accountability, addressing harmful gender norms, strengthening gender data analysis, ensuring investment, gender resource allocation and gender-focused results approach in multiple. At Regional and country levels priorities are multi-sectorally for gender integration. Limited cross sectoral work impacts gender results and integrated programing. To address this requires smarter investment, greater resource allocations and gender capacities in new proposals, programming, PBRs and CPD planning stages. A growing external risk in the region is gender equality backlash, re-traditionalization, persistent gender norms, less space for working beyond the gender binary and a diminishing space for women empowerment networks and civil society space. Without joined-up inter-agency action these externalities may limit the pathways for gender transformative programming in the region.

ECAR,Georgia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons learned:
· Since the beginning of the outbreak, UNICEF continued to be in the field, including in hard-to-reach areas, supporting the most vulnerable communities. This community-based approach, under the leadership of the Representative, opened new doors for new partnerships and programmatic interventions to expand access and achieve results for children, including in politically sensitive and minority populated areas
· Cross-sectoral work with municipalities, academia, and religious and community leaders provided a comprehensive mechanism for moving the child rights agenda forward, in line with the Code on the Rights of the Child. Moreover, it opened new pathways to bring various stakeholders together to engage on human and child rights. 
· Creation of diverse platforms and opportunities for advocacy messages including the Facebook Chatbot, issue-based webinars, social media campaigns involving groups of young people, and engagement of religious and community leaders, in addition to traditional methods (such as media engagement and government advocacy) proved to be effective in engaging targeted groups of people with specific messaging. 
· While the COVID-19 pandemic created significant challenges and caused major disruptions in service provision, it created opportunities to address existing issues, accelerate actions and modernize service provision. Guidelines for hybrid service provision have been developed so the services developed can be applied beyond the COVID-19 crisis, especially for children from remote and hard-to-reach areas. 
· Long-term agreements (LTAs) for services and supplies were established at the initial stage of emergency, based on the contingency plan, and facilitated the process of procuring emergency supplies, saving time and costs. Other UN Agencies in Georgia also used UNICEF’s established LTAs.
 
Innovations: 
· An important part of the COVID emergency response has been a digital transformation to ensure the continuity of essential health, education and social services for children. The Government, with support from UNICEF, developed online learning materials, reaching an estimated 414,000 children; developed remote and hybrid provision of social services as well as a specialized TV programme and Facebook page to support parents of children with disabilities; provided online consultations and/or training for 5,369 adolescents to meet their psychosocial needs; developed a remote antenatal care programme reaching approximately 26,000 pregnant women; and is currently developing an online practice for well-baby check-ups and a communication platform for 1,000 rural primary healthcare ambulatories to support effective management of the COVID-19 response as well as to ensure the continuation of essential health services for mothers and their children. 
· A national toll-free COVID-19 child hotline was established in partnership between UNICEF, the Parliament and the State Care Agency. The line will be further enhanced to meet international standards for child helplines.
· Development of culturally appropriate approaches to engage key community leaders such as the Elder’s Council and Women’s Council in Pankisi Gorge, who are owners of customary law, created a pathfinding opportunity to bring various stakeholders together to engage on human and child rights in the region. 
· New technologies were utilized to identify possible sources of lead exposure based on lead isotopes identified in blood samples and GIS mapping to identify hotspots of lead contamination (i.e. mines, metal industry, etc.).
· UNICEF supported the National Agency for Crime Prevention and Probation to develop online mediation and services for children in conflict with the law including the corresponding methodology and guidelines as well as strengthening the capacity of 157 professionals (mediators, social workers and psychologists working with children in conflict with the law) to provide distance service provision.
· New staff members benefited from on-the-job training from experienced colleagues in other offices through online platforms. The office made an announcement through UNICEF’s supply division (in Copenhagen) and Yammer platform, UNICEF’s collaboration tool that helps connect and engage across the organization, to identify staff willing to participate in this innovative undertaking to enhance the capacities of new staff members. The identified trainers/mentors provided virtual training to new staff members through Skype for Business, Zoom and/or Teams. This created financial and time efficiency and a fast on-the-job training process as the trainee was able to do transactions/processes/documentation in real-time with direct support. 
· As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF adapted its working modalities within a nexus of flexibility, trust and accountability to allow for all staff members to meet family and personal care needs. This was combined with adjusting workflow processes by formalizing electronic and digital signatures for internal documents.

ECAR,Greece,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF undertook a multi annual evaluation, in close coordination with the Regional Office, which examined how and how well UNICEF contributed to responding to the refugee and migrant crisis in Greece from 2016-2019. Using a non-experimental, theory-based approach, the evaluation gathered evidence from review of documentation, key stakeholder interviews, focus group discussions and two surveys based on UNICEF’s quality assurance criteria for evaluations, including gender-responsiveness. COVID-19 only nominally impacted the evaluation process since all field mission for data collection occurred before the crisis. 
The evaluation team gave a final virtual presentation of the evaluation to the Greece Partnership Office staff, ECARO representatives, and partners from the Government of Greece and civil society. The findings and recommendations directly fed into the new Greece programme and office modality, as well as the broader discussion for the region on its work in middle- and high-income countries.
The evaluation found that UNICEF played a critical role in raising awareness on child rights in the migrant and refugee response in Greece, embedding important international frameworks, such as the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), CCCs, and UNICEF’s 6-point Agenda for Children on the Move. It was also found that UNICEF swiftly and effectively adapted its “two-track” intervention approach, which included both emergency response and institutional support, to the local context. Whereas the initial response mostly implied provision of essential services to migrant and refugee children and their caregivers, from 2018 an “all children approach” started being considered. UNICEF overcame challenges related to the out-posted nature of its presence in Greece and developed pertinent programmatic modalities with regard to all thematic areas, adapting them over time and to changing needs and context. 
The COVID-19 pandemic was an opportunity to identify new ways of working within UNICEF as well as with partners and communities. For example, the recent, ongoing exercise on distance learning assessment revealed difficulties in access to the digital platforms (facebook, podcasts, wordpress, etc.) by children due to the availability of internet and a lack of digital devices, but more significantly by the lack of digital literacy by the parents and insufficient communication about the online platforms. With this as a lesson, a new project funded by ECW is trying to fill this gap and have outreach community mobilisers who will explain the available tools and resources and support parents in home-based learning. In addition, remote modalities have offered the opportunity to have an even great reach, particularly with online trainings.
In July 2020, UNICEF decided to carry out an assessment of distance learning using a sample of school-age children from 12 Open Accommodation Sites where UNICEF and partners currently provide non-formal education (among other services). Some key findings included: 
-        77% of children participated in at least one of the distance learning tools and the majority rated them positively. Homework packages were the most used (72%) usually daily or 2-3 times per week.
-        Children already enrolled in NFE participated in distance learning at a much higher rate (72%) compared to those out of education (20%).
-        Engagement with education actors was seen as critical to children’s interaction with the various distance learning tools/materials.
-        Girls had an overall higher participation rate than boys, yet boys engaged more with self-learning tools. 
-        Among children enrolled in formal education, only 11% participated in the MoE distance learning materials for various reasons including primarily lack of information (48%). 
-        Connection and access to internet impacted the ability of children to use online learning tools  
Through this exercise UNICEF was able to take away critical lessons learned such as the importance of communication between children and their teachers, multiple delivery channels (e.g. print and digital materials), and the benefits from blended learning programmes.  
UNICEF continued and scaled up the implementation of the Akelius digital language learning platform, an innovative global partnership promoting language learning in different contexts. The advanced offline version of the platform in 2020 helped reached unaccompanied children residing in shelters during school closures. 
The UNICEF Greece Country Office supported a research initiated by the Innocenti research centre and UNICEF HQ to evaluate the outcomes thus far of the Akelius platform and its impact on children. The research, published in November, revealed the advantage of the blended learning approach incorporating  the Akelius course in the Greek context, specifically showing:  8%  improvement in listening, 9%in reading, 25% improvement in speaking and 34% in writing skills in comparison to students in similar GSL classes but without the use of the Akelius course.
UNICEF GCO capitalized on the LearnIn experience which engaged formal education teachers based on the translated Emergency Manual developed by ECARO. The LearnIn platform provided a wealth of knowledge and good practice exchange for teachers in response to COVID-19 temporary school closures.
In the face of transitional context with the formal establishment of a UNICEF Country Office in Greece, the programme future effectiveness is centered around shaping the new vision for the country program, in close consultation with all related actors. Such vision will respond to the bottlenecks and challenges for the realization of children’s rights in the country, as identified through the Office Situation Analysis, and to priorities at national, regional and global levels and will be supported by the ongoing change management process, restructuring and capacity building of the programme team to be able to respond to the new identified areas of work, while continuing the GCO work with refugee and migrant children. These efforts will be further supported by an integrated approach to planning through alignment of advocacy, fundraising and programme priorities.

ECAR,Kazakhstan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"     
The  COVID-19 pandemic had a major impact on the programme implementation in Kazakhstan  requiring revision of the workplan, development of a Humanitarian Action for  Children appeal jointly with ECARO to address emerging needs of children and  families due to COVID-19, changing the modalities of programme delivery (i.e.  digital first programming during the lockdown), and applying simplification  procedures enabled by UNCEF HQ. The main lesson learnt was that adjustment of  the programming in a drastically changing environment created numerous  challenges  to deliver the results for children on the ground, for  example, shifting Government’s priorities away from children’s agenda due to  COVID-19 and stretched capacity to provide services;  conducting  remotely UNICEF programmatic and financial assurance activities, restricted  travel and offline events. However, COVID-19 also created many opportunities,  for example, budget savings, expanding the coverage of our capacity building  activities due to online format - both the number of beneficiaries and  geographical coverage, simplification and digitalization of many UNICEF  procedures.  COVID-19 has also significantly affected the working  modality with implementing partners, so the COVID-19 IP management guide  issued by HQs proved very useful throughout the year.   
  
  The digital first programme and communication approach proved to be  successful during the quarantine. The total number of UNICEF social media  followers increased by 3.6 times in comparison with the last year (from  20,000 in 2019 to 72,376 in 2020). The Country Office’s reach on social media  has significantly exceeded the target set – over 11 million reached against 5  million planned. This was mainly due to engaging social media influencers and  policy makers in the #LearningAtHomeChallenge and World Children's Day  #KidsTakeover campaigns. In total, for the last two years over 80 influencers  amplified UNICEF messaging. UNICEF’s account has been promoted by Instagram  as an official source for COVID-19 pandemic information. 
  
  Among other positive lessons learned was successful application of volunteers’  engagement in supporting UNICEF programme delivery as well as advocacy and  communication outreach to the public at large. Since the start of the UNICEF  volunteering programme in March 2020, about 7,500 young volunteers have been  taking part in it. They conducted online lessons for more than 36,000  schoolchildren and 1,500 parents as well as created over 3,300 social media  posts and reached out over 750,000 online users. In 2020 the volunteering  program covered 6 themes: disseminating life-saving messages to prevent  COVID-19 and address myths; prevention of bullying online and in schools;  plastic use reduction by children; enhancing disaster risk reduction  knowledge; promoting children’s rights and inclusive society. Over 3,000  posts published by the UNICEF-led network of young volunteers ensured  outstanding online reach during COVID-19 with child rights messages and  further promotion and engagement on UNICEF social media accounts.  
  
  In 2020, UNICEF Kazakhstan team continued to invest in innovative solutions  to improve transparency and efficiency of our practices on managing  partnerships with IPs. In particular, with support from Innovations Office,  the CO has been finalizing a smart contract using blockchain technology to  increase accountability in transferring resources to UNICEF partners and  decrease paperwork. The prototype is planned to be finalized in January 2021  and presented to ICTD and other HQ divisions for the scale up. 
  
  Another innovation piloted in Kazakhstan aimed to promote the importance of  technical and soft skills for girls in STEM, in particular the space  industry.  UNICEF Kazakhstan jointly with the Al-Farabi Kazakh National  University launched an educational project for girls on development of UniSat  nanosatellites. The participants of the UniSat programme - girls aged between  14-35 – designed, programmed, assembled, and tested a nanosatellite  prototype, which was successfully launched into the stratosphere. Currently,  the CO is planning the scale up of the programme to showcase a pioneering  approach to skills programming with and for girls for their empowerment and  success in the future as well as share learnings to other UNICEF country  offices for possible replication.  
  
  The pandemic gave additional relevance to the GIGA initiative for which  Kazakhstan stepped forward as a regional convener and the COVID-19 experience  highlighted last mile connectivity issues in Kazakhstan as well. The business  case for Kazakhstan has been finalized and received additional funding to  expand and strengthen the initiative in-country and in the region. A needs  assessment on Digital Public Goods and financial model design are planned for  Q1 of 2021.  

  To strategize business engagement for accelerating results for children and to strengthen capacity of staff in building relevant and meaningful partnership with business, the office conducted a study on business impact on child rights in Kazakhstan and arranged the training on Business for Results for all programme staff.  Following the results of the research and B4R training, the office intends to integrate partnership with business as one of the key stakeholders of the programme of cooperation in the workplans and programme strategies to leverage the power and resources of business in addressing the critical areas of child rights violation as a result for enhancing positive business practices and advocating for child rights
"
ECAR,Kosovo (UN SC resolution 1244),Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The 2020 Kosovo Programme Evaluation highlighted that UNICEF Kosovo has created, cultivated, and maintained good relationships across a wide range of stakeholders at multiple levels as a trusted and respected agency. The evaluation outlined UNICEF’s convening power for enabling partnerships and coordination as one of its most significant strengths which serves as a core foundation of all of its efforts. The evaluation, further, contains a wide variety of lessons learned at both the macro and programme levels. A few key macro lessons learned from the evaluation which remain relevant upon entering the new programme cycle from 2021 include: The continuous need to reinforce and promote intersectoral approaches to programming, the need to continue the focus on taking to scale promising interventions at the municipal level, the untapped potential of mayors and municipal officials to drive the child rights agenda,  engagement with diverse interest groups including the private sector, young people and international financial organizations to contribute to enriching the quality of UNICEF interventions and to help to strengthen the UNICEF brand in Kosovo. 
In line with the Activation of UNICEF’s Corporate Emergency Level 3 Scale-Up Procedure in response to the global COVID-19 crisis, UNICEF in March 2020 operationalized the principles of flexibility and adapted its programming to deliver the most effective and timely response. In close collaboration with key stakeholders and implementing partners, UNICEF adjusted its planned activities for consistency with the COVID-19 measures to ensure an effective and timely response to the pandemic situation with a focus on reaching the most marginalized. The timely programmatic adjustments and additional emergency work taken on, contributed to the positioning of UNICEF as fast and uniquely fit for purpose to respond and address the needs of most marginalized during the emergency. This was highlighted as a key finding in the Kosovo Programme Evaluation where respondents consistently emphasized that UNICEF was the fastest responder to mobilize relevant support to affected populations. 
The strong engagement during the pandemic from UNICEF and adapting to new modalities translated into bringing in new opportunities for children during the unprecedented times. The ECD digital platform for children aged 0-6 years not only provided an opportunity for children to continue their preschool education but also allowed to expand education opportunities to those children who have not been enrolled in any preschool education programmes before COVID-19. To ensure children and adolescents were able to continue their education in school, as schools reopened from Septmber, UNICEF supported MES and NIPH to develop a Case Registry and Reporting module integrated in the EMIS to track COVID-19 infections by school. The module provides real-time data on COVID-19 detected and suspicious cases at individual, classroom and school level, which informs MES and NIPH to apply the relevant measures and learning modalities for specific schools, avoiding full closure of schools Kosovo-wide.  Similarly, the digitalization of the 21st century skills programmes – UPSHIFT, PONDER, PODIUM – and the launching of the Learning Passport opened up new opportunities and flexibility on the implementation of programmes for adolescents and youth.  
UNICEF’s efforts to meaningfully engage youth in all programmatic milestones such as development of the Situation Analysis, the Kosovo Programme 2021-2025, the Kosovo Programme Evaluation and the Mid-year and Annual Review Meetings in 2020 contributed to a greater ownership of the UNICEF programme by youth. The implementation of the youth accompanied Kosovo Programme Evaluation in 2020, showcased the importance of engaging youth as stakeholders. Engaging youth in the process of the evaluation, not only supported their development through gaining new skills and hands on experience, but also enriched the evaluation process and content with youth perspectives mainstreamed throughout the process. The five youth students highlighted that their participation in the evaluation served as a capacity-building exercise, during which they acquired skills and knowledge needed for their areas of study and professional development. Amplification of youth voices through the U-Report platform was particularly critical during the COVID-19 situation. During 2020, ten U-Report polls were conducted on issues related to COVID-19 pandemic, including on attitudes towards protection measures, mask wearing, impact on education and jobs, which were instrumental to continuously inform the UNICEF emergency response and engagement with adolescents and youth through programmes. 
Following the endorsement of the Kosovo Programme for 2021-2025 in September by the UNICEF Executive Board, the Kosovo office initiated the preparations for a smooth transition to the new programme, which places a multi sectoral approach as the cornerstone of the implementation. The participatory process for the development of the upcoming programme resulted in increased ownership by Kosovo institutions and other stakeholders. Moreover, the initiation of programme implementation in key selected municipalities served as a smooth birthing for the implementation of Kosovo Programme for 2021-2025. The multi sectoral approach implemented by UNICEF for its three key priority areas, “Increased coverage and quality of ECD and ECE programmes” “Inclusion of CwD” and “Empowerment of adolescents and youth” has already influenced the cross-sectoral approach implementation with Kosovo institutions and other stakeholders namely through the establishment of multi-disciplinary working groups.
Engagement with the private sector brought additional support to the agenda of inclusion of children living with disabilities and to the home visiting programme. This partnership contributed to narrowing the equity gap in favor of families in need through access to assistive technology to facilitate distance learning, especially during the time of COVID-19. In addition, with the support of the private sector to the home visiting programme, more frequent visits of nurses can be conducted to families living in the most rural areas to continue providing health services.

"
ECAR,Moldova,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted business processes and required flexibility and adaptability, innovation and bespoke solutions to challenges. 
 
Teleworking for results
 
As in most countries, the pandemic led to an unprecedented situation in the Republic of Moldova, with either the complete or partial shutdown of businesses, schools and essential services. To protect the health of its staff and their dependents, UNICEF Moldova implemented full-time homeworking arrangements for all staff. All activities were conducted online, including programme, operations and management team meetings, programme monitoring visits, assurance activities for the harmonized approach to cash transfers (HACT), and others. Programme partnership management was ensured using the eTools platform. Partnerships with the government and CSOs, including planned activities and budgets, were quickly adapted and redirected to focus on immediate, potentially life-saving initiatives and activities. This was made possible largely by the declaration of the global Level 3 emergency and the flexible yet robust policies and operational instruments at the disposal of UNICEF in such circumstances. The adaptation process also made us acutely aware of the utility of available online tools and platforms for communication, knowledge management and information sharing. These enabled timely programme adaptation and coordination and helped to achieve full implementation of the planned activities and budgets. Despite fewer in-person interactions, teleworking has had no negative effect on staff morale and working relationships.
 
Building capacity better
 
One of the core strategies for achieving results in 2020 was capacity-building for partners to ensure rapid scale up and delivery of essential services during the pandemic. UNICEF Moldova has extensive experience in providing capacity-building to the government, civil society and individuals, but this was the first year where such efforts were provided almost exclusively online. This presented both challenges and opportunities. Online training allowed for the wider participation of stakeholders, and reduced travel and logistical costs (and the environmental damage). Recording these sessions also enabled participants to revisit the materials, and gave access to people who had been unable to attend. On the other hand, online capacity-building is typically less engaging and effective, and makes it hard to build a rapport with the audience. 
 
The pandemic further deepened gender inequalities and gender-based violence in families and society. To redress these inequalities, there was a special focus during training on equally supporting and empowering boys and girls from an early age, engaging fathers in children’s rearing and empowering women to fully exercise their rights and return to labour market. 
 
While some of the challenges could be addressed through creative delivery approaches and a reliance on more sophisticated online learning platforms, the UNICEF country office identified two issues with online capacity-building, especially large-scale capacity-building. The first was the technological literacy of the target audience, and their access to ICT technology. It has become clear that all online capacity-building efforts need to be preceded by an assessment of literacy and access, followed by elementary technological literacy courses offered to participants. The second issue highlighted is the need to ensure that sessions for the training of online trainers also includes aspects of communication and delivering materials to online audiences. While trainers may be experts in a particular field, presentation and communication skills are also essential for delivering quality training.   
 
Real-time data during a pandemic
 
Data collection systems that feed into national statistics are inadequate during emergency times, when timely information about the situation on the ground is essential for policymakers and stakeholders providing support to the national emergency response systems. Aside from getting data related to the spread of the infection, real-time monitoring of the secondary impact (such as on education, nutrition, poverty and other socioeconomic aspects) was a challenge in the Republic of Moldova, as elsewhere. To address this issue, UNICEF Moldova adopted several strategies to obtain first-hand information about the impact of COVID-19, the emerging needs of the population, especially young people, and the effects of the pandemic measures taken by key stakeholders. 
 
The reliance on traditional research through survey and secondary data analysis remained high on the agenda, although it was even more important this year to gather such information in a coordinated manner, in close collaboration with sister agencies, development partners and the government. UNICEF supported a study on the impact of the pandemic on remittances received by households with children, and collected information about the learning experience of students, teachers and parents. This added to the knowledge-generation exercises conducted by other United Nations agencies that, combined, provided a well-rounded picture of the COVID-19 impact and produced a plethora of recommendations for decision-makers. 
 
UNICEF Moldova also relied on data collected through U-Report, which had an average of 17,000 users (68 per cent female). There were about 30 U-Report polls on various topics, including domestic violence, online education, and COVID-19 guidance on infection prevention and control. Each U-Report poll yielded insights that were used to inform UNICEF programmes and activities implemented by CSOs and government partners, as well as sister agencies and development partners. 
 
Lastly, it is important to highlight the novel approach of UNICEF Moldova in using games as instruments for information and knowledge-sharing. A new game-based approach was piloted as an effective way to raise awareness on the SDGs and child rights among youth and children. UNICEF Moldova and local partners developed a toolkit, Dialogica, that enables local youth organizations to engage in dialogue about the SDGs through educational games. Nearly 300 teachers and youth volunteers were trained to use the toolkit. Over 1,200 adolescents aged between 10 and 18 years from 14 regions participated in the initiatives. A nationwide online game brought together more than 1,400 young participants to build and test their knowledge on SDGs, as well as relevant COVID-19 measures.

Agility  and resilience are needed to quickly adapt and respond to the emerging  issues. The  repeating roadblocks to the opening of EU accession negotiations witnessed  throughout the programme cycle, contributed to the political volatility  fragility in North Macedonia hampering systematic reforms including those in  social sectors. Based on the past experience, it is quite likely that such an  environment will also continue during the new country programme.  UNICEF  programmes and advocacy have been taking into due consideration the  conditions in which the Government operates by constantly scanning the  horizon, reviewing and adjusting strategies including through  the expansion of  the partnerships beyond the traditional ones.  This approach has allowed UNICEF in North Macedonia to progress in  achieving results for children despite political volatility. 
   
The year allowed several lessons on how COVID-19 unveil child related  systems’ weakness to operate during the pandemic. First and utmost,  the COVID-19 pandemic unveiled the deep-rooted weaknesses of the health  system in North Macedonia. Effectively coping with the current and future  challenges, including possible pandemics, will not be possible  without additional investments in the health system strengthening. The experience  gained during COVID-19 pandemic provided real life examples of coping  strategies and successful adaptations especially in the relation to the use  of digital technologies. Thus, despite causing serious disruptions, the  COVID-19 pandemic also helped accelerate the introduction of digital  technology to the work of social service professionals and allowed for  certain services to be made available to home-bound children and families in  remote areas, who would not have had access to the services prior to the  pandemic. The effects of these practices need to be closely evaluated to  investigate the potential for their scale-up beyond the pandemic.
   
In the area of education, COVID-19 shed the light on the country’s  unpreparedness to organize online learning when schools closed in March 2020.  Lack of digital resources and lack of teacher digital and pedagogical  competences to fully embark on distance and blended learning was more than  evident. Previously developed e-resources could not be retrieved as a result  of sporadic collection and storing of the data with little attention payed on  sustainability. Prior to the pandemic teachers were receiving few  opportunities for professional development in all areas, including digital  learning. Faced with such challenges in times of learning crises, UNICEF  supported the Ministry of Education and Science to ensure adequate learning  environment for teachers and students. In a less than a week, volunteer  teachers were on TV conducting lessons, and National Digital Platform  (Eduino) was available immediately, months ahead of the initial schedule,  and  expanded the scope of this one-stop-shop for sharing online lessons  for all children aged 3 to 18. The institutional experience gained in  the building Eduino, alongside the resources and competencies developed,  create a government owned and managed distance learning system that continues  to grow in breadth and quality, serving the entire education sector.
  
The demand for data including in child related areas is low.  Moreover, there is an evident need for a stronger constituency for child  rights in the country. At present, there is no functioning mechanism through  which monitoring, promoting and advocating for children’s rights are  effectively carried out. Some elements of child rights monitoring exist—for  example, a department for protection of children and persons with  disabilities within the Office of the Ombudsman, or civil society  organizations that either advocate for children’s rights or, by providing  services to children, are able to witness and voice violations of their  rights—but these are insufficient and make child rights monitoring fragmented  and inefficient. Given past initiatives, the architecture and functioning of  such mechanism must be well thought out to avoid previous mistakes and put in  place a sustainable solution. 
   
Programme management and coordination. The COVID-19  response was planned, coordinated and implemented within the framework of the  global COVID-19  HAC, with results  reported through the global and regional Situation reports. The prolonged COVID-19  pandemic clearly demonstrated the need to further integrate emergency  specific interventions with the regular programme not only to prevent  parallel results but also capitalize on the experience gained during  emergency response and inform regular programme. In 2020, with  the support of the ECARO, UNICEF North Macedonia completed a comprehensive  Gender Programme Review. The recommendations of the GPR  has formed the solid ground for the  development of the annual Gender action plan thus allowing to enhance gender  mainstreaming and integration across all outcomes of the new country  programme.
   
The Generation Unlimited Challenge noted special achievements in  North Macedonia  enabling young teams to develop innovative solutions The   partnership with academia and business sector allowed young people to benefit  from mentorship and seed funding and develop necessary skills which  translated into a number of winning teams of the Generation Unlimited   from North Macedonia. The team eBionics develop a  solution to expand access to prosthetic care with Venus Arm, an open-source  3D printed bionic arm for people with upper limb deficiency. It is the second  time that young people from North Macedonia received this global  recognition. 
  
Team Something Atypical was  selected as an honorary team at the national challenge and won additional  funding from Foundation Telecom as well as mentorship support. This support  allowed the team to further develop their solution and apply for other  competitions. As a result, they were selected as winner from Europe and South  Asia among 4,000 teams at the global competition Ideas4Action by The World  Bank and the Zicklin Center at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton  School of Business. Their innovative solution - the mobile application  Walkiie - enables families and friends of persons with disabilities to connect  with volunteers who organize social activities.

ECAR,Rep of Uzbekistan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons Learned
In 2020, UNICEF Uzbekistan completed the evaluation of its  country programme circle for 2016-2020 with the main lessons learnt applied  immediately and in developing the new programme of cooperation between UNICEF  and the Government of Uzbekistan for 2021-2025.
It was recognized that UNICEF Uzbekistan successfully adapts to a rapidly  changing external environment by adjusting its mode of operations in a very  short time. The key to this success was an effective analysis of the external  context and maintaining focus on UNICEF priorities while capitalizing on the  new opportunities for policy dialogue. The effectiveness of this approach was  once more proved with the onset of the COVID leading to adjusting of UNICEF  operations to remote mode but still delivering the services, advocating for  and developing new programmes and policies. UNICEF could use momentum to  secure a new strategic positioning as a broker of resources with new  alliances and new sources of funding.
UNICEF Uzbekistan has engaged in discussions of new partnerships with  International Financial Institutions and potential donors and non-traditional  funding sources. UNICEF in Uzbekistan has the comparative advantage of its  reputation and mandate for child rights which means it has the legitimacy to  lead on issues that others may find difficult to broach such as inequity,  social exclusion, and gender, and to use potentially sensitive issues such as  violence against children to challenge social norms. 
The Gender Programmatic review (GPR) and Country Programme evaluation  conducted in 2020 showed clearly that to deliver results for women  successfully, young people and children it is important for UNICEF to meet  the highest quality standards of gender responsiveness programming. As a  follow-up, UNICEF Uzbekistan already started introducing changes such as the  establishment of the post of Gender/Inclusion Specialist and development of  the Country Office Gender and Disability Strategies in the new country  programme.
 
The Country Office produced effective results when there are deliberate  efforts for cross-sectoral collaboration. There is much more potential for  further strategic collaborations to contribute to a greater dynamism and more  effective results for all stakeholders. Supporting reform initiatives,  including modelling of approaches requires the integration, scale-up and  institutionalization mechanisms from the onset to ensure sustainability. The  institutionalization of assistance is key to ensuring sustainability and  bringing about long-term change. Institutionalization tends to face  administrative and legal barriers, which need to be recognized and addressed  in the risk-mitigation strategy, which should underpin the implementation of  the reform support initiative.
 
Innovations
In 2020 COVID-19 proved to be the major factor influencing innovations in the  country office mainly to ensure continuity of program interventions while  minimizing the risks to COVID-19 infection to staff, partners and children.  The following examples serve to illustrate this fact:
Blended Learning: The Government has decided to continue the use of  distance learning in a blended approach. In order to address learning losses  due to compromised lessons during the last term of the academic year,  2019-2020 as a result of covid-19  UNICEF supported the Government to  come up with guidelines to enhance teacher capacities to assess students’  learning, identify gaps and prepare individualized remedial education plans including  guidelines to enhance teachers’ and students’ capacity to study through  “blended” learning mode which would have been unthinkable before COVID-19.  The positive spin-off of this innovation is the government commitment to  improve the ICT infrastructure and internet access to all schools in  Uzbekistan. 
  
Adapting training and workshops to the online platforms: As a  response to travel restrictions and social distancing requirements, many  online trainings were adapted as a duty of care measure to minimize the risk  of infection to Covid-19.   While many trainings were cancelled,  UNICEF managed to facilitate the design and delivery of a certified  four-month online re-training programme on Social Work for more than 70  service providers from different agencies. This activity is aimed at  improving the competency of service providers in bringing positive changes in  the lives of vulnerable people by addressing social challenges such as  poverty, violence, family separation, disability, discrimination, and others.
Ongoing classical MICS operation:  Uzbekistan is the only  country in the ECA region which despite COVID-19 had to continue with  field-based MICS operation by applying available precautions: use of PPE,  physical distancing, regular PCR testing, vaccination against flu and  pneumonia, medical insurance for the engaged teams. A successful  MICS will yield reliable, up-to-date and internationally comparable data  including children-related indicators. "
ECAR,Republic of Kyrgyzstan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons learned

COVID-19 highlighted critical gaps in service delivery for women and children, especially the most disadvantaged. The health system, in particular, failed to effectively prevent and manage the pandemic due to inadequate epidemiological surveillance, insufficient human resources and capacity, fragile procurement and logistics, poor healthcare facility management and inadequate infrastructure to adhere to infection prevention and control (IPC) requirements. Failure to invest in sufficient sanitation infrastructure over the years limited health and education sectors’ ability to respond to COVID-19. As needs escalated and Government requests for UNICEF support in the area of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) in health and education sectors increased, gaps in WASH expertise within the Office became apparent. In 2020, UNICEF drew on short-term external expertise. Moving forward, the Office will build its internal capacity to support the Government in mobilizing an effective WASH response to the pandemic and investing domestic resources in long-term WASH infrastructure and practices. 

The social protection system was unable to effectively address the profound socio-economic impact of COVID-19 because it could not quickly expand social protection programmes for the growing population in need.  Kyrgyzstan is facing a major fiscal crisis, in which partners/donors close the gaps in the state’s obligations. Currently, the Government perceives expansion of social protection schemes as unfeasible. However, there is room to review current programmes to improve their effectiveness and efficiency. This will require joint engagement and advocacy by UN agencies and IFIs, and common policy guidance.  For example, the productive technical partnership with the World Bank on poverty and social protection established during the impact assessment of COVID-19 should underpin a joint policy advocacy effort to reduce child poverty and scale up existing social assistance programmes.

Young people demonstrated high levels of civic engagement in 2020. Young volunteers were invaluable in saving lives during the COVID-19 crisis, by directly supporting medical teams in hospitals and bringing medical equipment and drugs to patient’s home.

 Following parliamentary elections in October 2020, young people took to the streets to contest results and demand change. These developments demonstrated youth’s strong demand to have a voice and a role in shaping the future of Kyrgyzstan. Currently, there are no meaningful platforms for young people to express their views and engage in decision making at the national level. Building on UNICEF’s efforts to amplify voices of youth at the local level through the Youth and Child Friendly Local Governance initiative, UNICEF will explore strengthening its work on youth participation in 2021. 
 
Innovations

COVID-19 provided an opportunity to accelerate telemedicine reform and implementation. Telemedicine’s role in delivering routine healthcare services, especially at the primary health care level, was accentuated by the pandemic. In July 2020, an estimated 21 per cent of healthcare workers were infected with COVID-19, further compromising the health sector's ability to respond effectively. Remote healthcare minimizes direct contact between patient and provider, reducing the risk of transmission of COVID-19. It also frees up health facilities, enabling optimal care for those affected by COVID-19. UNICEF supported the Ministry of Health to adjust existing guidelines for primary healthcare level personnel so they could offer consultations to patients via smartphones (through the WhatsApp platform), referring patients to facilities only when necessary. UNICEF shared these innovations in a webinar with Latin American and Caribbean region countries. 

In education, besides reaching over 1.4 million children in preschools and schools with remote learning lessons, advances were also made to promote digitalisation and improve the EMIS. The new EMIS tracks all children's inclusion and participation in quality education (including children with disabilities and children in difficult life circumstances such as children from migrant families, and children without parental care). This data, student attendance rates, and teacher qualifications can be further disaggregated.  Every individual recorded in EMIS is allocated a unique identification number (PIN) from the Civil Registry Office central database. This allows EMIS to be linked to other Health and Social Development sector databases to monitor, refer and seek cross-sectoral solutions to the barriers that some children may face. In cooperation with the National Statistical Committee, all statistical reporting forms integrate to EMIS, and in 2021, the MOES will be able to produce education sector statistical reports from EMIS, with UNICEF support. 

Pandemic restrictions demanded innovative ways of collecting data. A MICS Follow-up survey on the impact of COVID-19 on Children and Women was completed by the National Statistics Committee (NSC) in December 2020, with UNICEF support. The planned face-to-face MICS follow up survey was replaced by a safer telephone-based survey. Assessment was based on a sub-sample (3,886) of MICS-2018 households. The survey provides important insights into the profound impact of COVID-19 on child well-being.  Widespread job and income loss and economic insecurity among families will likely increase rates of child poverty and child labour, and hamper access to quality healthcare. The survey also estimates how many children were covered by remote learning during school closures and where inequalities persisted. The new system is now in place and the capacity of the NSC has been strengthened to allow it to continue conducting short surveys on various MICS subsamples for rapid, reliable and inexpensive data collection.

COVID-19 exacerbated the weakness of case management services provided to children and families. Due to movement restrictions during quarantine, case managers were unable to promptly assess the situation of most vulnerable children and to provide the services required. To strengthen the response to at-risk children during COVID-19, UNICEF supported the Ministry of Labour and Social Development to create a digitalised case management system. The database has been developed to simplify and enhance the case management service, from initial warning signs, to the closure of the case. The system generates an individual child protection plan and family support plan.

ECAR,Republic of Montenegro,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"COVID-19 has had a severe impact on children, adolescents and young people – leaving them more vulnerable to poverty, violence and social exclusion and reducing their ability to reach their full potential and gain knowledge and skills essential for life and decent employment. Impact was particularly strong on vulnerable and marginalized children (including Roma and Egyptian children, children with disabilities and refugee and migrant children) but also on children of families that suddenly faced poverty. COVID-19 and its socio-economic impact exacerbated existing widespread structural weaknesses – especially in governance, finance, service delivery and monitoring ¿ and created new vulnerabilities. But the pandemic also highlighted important entry points for strengthening the health and social and child protection systems, which could accelerate inclusive, sustainable recovery and SDG achievement and improve system resilience to future shocks.  UNICEF’s strong focus on cross-sectoral, integrated support for the most vulnerable children proved to be an essential strategy for both urgent humanitarian actions and system-strengthening initiatives. Lessons learned during 2020 and captured in the 2020 country programme evaluation, including innovations and adaptions to programme implementation, and continuous monitoring of programme results and partnerships informed the programme planning for 2021 and the development of the next programme cycle (2022¿2026). Real-time data availability was instrumental to identifying needs and response priorities, but also helped to overcome shortcomings of interventions. Countrywide movement restrictions and limited capacities severely constrained the Government’s ability to collect real-time data on the socio-economic impact of COVID-19. Through U-Report and the UN RSIA, UNICEF supported data collection on the pandemic’s impact on the most vulnerable groups, in line with the ‘leave no one behind’ and gender equality principle. Another critical UNICEF role involved identifying and urgently responding to equity gaps, complementing the Government response to COVID-19 by reaching the most vulnerable children. The Government responded quickly to the crisis, but the response left many equity gaps, including: limited provision of direct aid to the most vulnerable; no support for those who could not access the remote learning system; limited social service provision (e.g. for persons with disabilities and victims of domestic violence and GBV); insufficient capacity to provide psycho-social support; and a limited focus on children as victims of domestic violence. UNICEF’s role in complementing the government’s response through direct action in partnership with national systems and civil society was able to bridge these significant equity gaps, and helped to identify critical systemic weaknesses to inform longer-term sector reforms. Leveraging existing partnerships and maximizing local capacities enabled a significant scale-up of the response. UNICEF was able to support the authorities to address gaps in services faced by vulnerable children and families by working with CSO networks and scaling-up longstanding CSO partnerships, such as the Red Cross, grass-roots organizations from the Roma and disability communities and women’s NGOs. By working with the Ombudsperson and CSOs UNICEF was able to reach the children most left behind and empower them to seek redress for child rights violations, including violence and child marriage.  During 2020, UNICEF shifted significantly to digital delivery of programmes and accelerated the development of digital platforms. Faced with lockdown and physical distancing requirements, UNICEF moved programmes and operations activities online. Support for the digitalization of education through the ‘Learning Passport’ and other online support activities in the areas of ECD, child protection and adolescent empowerment will continue to be a focus of UNICEF’s work in 2021 and beyond. The capacity to adapt UNICEF communications and advocacy strategies to the changing context was critical to the effectiveness of its crisis response.  As the UN lead on risk communication UNICEF supported national authorities but also complemented this work through its own channels. The CPE highlighted UNICEF’s evidence based long-term social change communication  as an example of good practice aimed at behavior change.  Therefore, UNICEF applied the same approach to its Covid-19  risk communication and communication engagement.  UNICEF also successfully advocated for safe school reopening, together with UN agencies and CSOs,  which resulted in the government’s commitment to keep schools open across the country and a commitment by the new government at the end of the year to expand in-person learning to all students at the start of the 2021 semester. UNICEF’s public communications required constant adjustment given the changing and sensitive context: changes in the political space and leadership of public institutions, rapid epidemiological evolution and socio-political tensions.   An all-important principle for 2020 was making staff wellbeing a priority. The Staff Association together with management undertook staff surveys and consultations to identify and mitigate challenges, with support from staff counsellor and peer support volunteers. A flexible approach to working from home, adapted to the changing epidemiological situation, enabled business continuity while allowing working mothers and fathers to balance work and family thus ensuring staff safety and wellbeing. During the final quarter of 2020 UNICEF completed a series of key building blocks for the next programme cycle, including a country programme evaluation, gender review and situation analysis of children. This enabled UNICEF to begin developing the 2022¿2026 country programme, which will focus on: addressing the impact of COVID-19 on children and families, contributing to national recovery, addressing systemic reforms to improve outcomes for children and strengthening the resilience of public services and families.  The emerging priority areas for systems reform and immediate action for recovery include: reducing child poverty; preventing and responding to violence against children and women; improving vaccination and nutrition coverage; and improving education quality and inclusiveness. Scaling-up investments in ECD across all sectors, the continuum of care and empowerment of adolescents and young people will guide a cross-sectoral approach to all priority issues. UNICEF envisions four key priorities for its new country programme: (1) ECD - getting the best start to life; (2) Improved learning outcomes, skills and empowerment for all children, adolescents and young people; (3) protecting children from poverty, adversity and violence; and (4) institutional accountability for child rights and leveraging resources for results for children."
ECAR,Romania,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Met fundraising targets despite challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The COVID-19 pandemic threatened UNICEF’s ambitious resource mobilization targets, with challenges on the side of private individuals as well as corporations. The face-to-face programme, which generates 65% of pledge income, had to be paused in mid-March and has no clear reopening date yet. Corporations that have been supporting us for many years were facing their own challenges during the crisis. Recognizing this early on, encourages UNICEF to explore innovative ways to raise funds. 
 
As a result, UNICEF conducted a feasibility study for starting a telemarketing campaign and then trained the facers into tele marketers. The telemarketing campaign was launched end 2020 and is currently being implemented. Initial results are promising (any numbers yet). As a result, 378 pledge donors were upgraded by the end of 2020. The objectives of the 12-month telemarketing campaign are to upgrade almost 7,000 pledge donors and raise US$ 0.42 million. 
 
Another strategy to address the challenge was to take our fundraising campaigns back to people’s living rooms. UNICEF implemented two TV fundraising campaigns, with great results considering the difficult period we are in; we signed up more than 12,000 new SMS pledge donors so far.
 
One lesson learnt during this process was the importance of flexibility, rapid response and the ability to adjust to change, in order to connect with other markets, learn from them and adjust existing plans and activities to a completely new, unknown context. Also, the importance of having a diversified income stream cannot be overestimated as a risk mitigation strategy.
 
As a result of these efforts we managed to reach our planned fundraising targets for 2020, a growth with 39% from 2019 (US$ 1.47 Million total gross revenue achieved in 2019, US$ 2.04 mil gross revenue achieved in 2020.
 
Created a knowledge and technical assistance team and explored new ways to finance this service.
In anticipation of Romania becoming a High-Income Country (which happened in 2020), and UNICEF’s changing role as a result, a new Knowledge Management and Technical Advisory team was established in the Country Office. This team will provide technical assistance and advisory support to their respective partners, leverage results and financing within their sectors. This team will also ensure that all of UNICEF’s advocacy, partnerships, communications and fundraising work is based on robust evidence, data and knowledge. 
Strengthening UNICEF’s technical assistance and knowledge function will not only increase relevance of UNICEF intervention in a high-income country like Romania, but also open the door for different financing alternatives for UNICEF programmes such as funding streams from the public budget or EU funding such as EU Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS). 
In terms of financing UNICEF knowledge and TA function UNICEF worked closely with the Ministries of Education and Labour & Social Justice and prepared so far 2 concrete proposals for the EU’s Structural Reform Services Programme (SRSP) in 2021. Other proposals are also under consideration, anticipating that increasingly this UNICEF role can be fully financed from this type of financing.
 
 
Developed teleworking standards for social services and community health care workers
Physical distancing is becoming a norm that poses a significant challenge to many aspects of social work. Case management was adjusted, as were the interactions between social workers and other professionals and beneficiaries of social services, to operate in an online environment. This required the revision of methodologies and standards aligned to the exiting normative framework. In this context, UNICEF is working in partnership with the Center for Legal Resources and the National Authority for Child Rights to develop the first teleworking standards for social services, targeting beneficiaries in residential facilities for children and adults with disabilities, and covering matters such as psychological counseling and legal advice.

The need for physical distancing and limitations on physical access to primary care services also led to support the development of a teleconsultation algorithm guideline for frontline health care workers. Changes in the epidemiological context affected the provision of case management and community services, requiring frequent changes and improvements of tools and instruments used.  

UNICEF staff as a resource in times of crisis
The pandemic required not only programmes and UNICEF business to be adjusted but also staff had to make significant changes in their work-life situation as well as in the way they manage and contribute to the work to be done. During the year we had exceptional contributions from staff to the COVID-19 response. One main example is the fact that all Programme staff took part in the data collection as part of the Rapid Assessment. This was significant not only for data collection, but also for programme staff to engage first-hand with the affected communities and professionals and thus getting a very direct view of the rapidly changing situation as well as the needs of most vulnerable communities. 
Besides this, we have multiple other examples where staff stepped up and contributed to the pandemic response programme, such as one of our Assistants – who is a trained psychologist – to volunteer het psychologist services as part of the Telverde Hotline for children in residential care. 

Tested and accelerated application of online and digital applications in UNICEF
Continuous investment in preparations for business continuity proved invaluable during the Covid-19 pandemic. From day one the entire office was able to successfully work remotely, having the required ICT equipment and systems in place and functioning. 
 
UNICEF Romania also continued to be at the front-line of new efficiency-driven global UNICEF projects, such as user-acceptance testing and piloting of DocuSign, piloting the pre-paid procurement cards, improve electronic banking, as well as the Service Gateway and SAP process improvements.
UNICEF Romania was among the first country offices to use fully automated e-banking, for both operational and donations accounts, resulting in efficiencies at the country office and GSSC.

ECAR,Serbia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"FOSTERING INNOVATION AND USE OF TECHNOLOGIES
 
Although digital learning, e-health and other innovative ways of improving access to and quality of social services for all children already featured in various government strategies and policy frameworks, the pandemic accelerated progress within a very short time. To ensure the most vulnerable children were not left behind in the national response, UNICEF actively supported key governmental and non-governmental partners to build digital literacy skills and adaptive systems, expand platforms to ensure broad access to digital learning and exchange, develop innovative tools for parents and young people. The Office for Information Technologies and e-Government worked with UNICEF to install the open-source RapidPro platform on government servers allowing further digitalization efforts in 2021.
 
UNICEF supported the social workforce to stay connected and provide peer-support through the establishment of the KonekTas online platform to enable continued service delivery to the most at-risk children. UNICEF also supported the national child helpline (NADEL) with additional functionalities including chat- and Viber-bots to provide alternative avenues for reporting abuse. Furthermore, UNICEF piloted the open-source assistive technology ‘C-Board’ that helps children with development disabilities (CWDD) to communicate more freely and independently and shared it for day-to-day use among ECI professionals. Engagement with local IT company VegaIT and the deaf association of Serbia will allow the creation of a sign-language app for young children to promote early use of sign language.
 
To support parents with personalized content on their children’s growth and development on their mobile phone, UNICEF with national partners and the private sector partner Nordeus developed the Halo Beba (Parent Buddy) app, which the UNICEF Regional Office for Eastern Europe and Central Asia is now scaling up to multi-country use.
 
The pandemic prevented children and young people from socializing with their peers at school, during sports and recreational activities and in their jobs, and to mitigate increased isolation UNICEF and the MoYS developed an online volunteering platform to both promote peer-support and provide a space for young people to share their experiences. The platform has the potential to expand online volunteering, particularly if MoYS use it to promote volunteering activities under their national programme, with work on this to continue in 2021.
 
LESSONS LEARNED
 
The response to the COVID-19 pandemic has shown the ability of the social service system to adapt to change, demonstrating that with the right support and training, many front-line workers in health, education and social welfare were able to change how they work within a very short time.
 
However, COVID-19 has also shifted the public discourse to primarily health and fiscal concerns, leaving less room for other issues, including those related to child rights. Going forward it will be important to find new ways of ensuring the child rights agenda remains a government and public priority with support from a broad range of national and international partners to achieve lasting results as we enter the second year in the Decade of Action towards the SDGs.
 
UNICEF’s leading role in the promotion and realization of child rights is widely recognized among key stakeholders in Serbia. The modelling evaluation initiated in 2020, looking at the approaches UNICEF is taking in education, ECD and child protection confirms this and yet also highlights key areas for further strengthening how models can be successfully scaled up in partnership with key national and multilateral stakeholders. Advocacy, communication and flexibility (‘fit for context’) are fundamental concepts in scaling up, and modelling and scaling up of innovative solutions needs to be a dynamic and non-linear process with capacities to looping back, reviewing, adapting and being agile as the context changes. 
 
Through persistent advocacy efforts, UNICEF was successful in influencing key policy frameworks, strategies and analyses for the benefit of children and young people. The Violence against Children strategy and action plan were endorsed, as was the analysis for the amendments to the Volunteer Law, whereas the long-pending finalization of the child rights law and juvenile justice reform efforts remain unfinished business. Furthermore, de-institutionalization has slightly stagnated this year. This shows the need for continued monitoring and flexible adjustments in strategies to respond to the external context, challenges and potential setbacks.
 
Traditional communication approaches have proven insufficient to tackle deep-rooted prejudices and stigmatization of children from the most vulnerable backgrounds, including those from Roma communities, children in contact with the law, poor children and children with disabilities. Initial efforts to change social norms and attitudes through new approaches, such as closer involvement of men as agents of change in combating child marriage, violence against children, and playful and nurturing parenting are showing initial positive signs.
 
Within the education sector, there is a need for further strengthening to ensure a child-focused and learning-oriented early childhood education system both at the national and local levels, and partnerships with non-traditional partners are required, such as the ministries in charge of local government and finance that are relevant for the expansion of ECE services at the local level. Moreover, regulation of all service providers, including those in the private sector, is needed to balance expansion with quality of services.
 
The shift from face-to-face to fully virtual engagements for professional learning and peer support, service provision, civic engagement and inclusive accessibility has both demonstrated opportunities and exposed limitations of the social service systems. When there is mutual recognition of the need and full ownership of programmatic achievements among all partners, social service systems can be flexible and very efficient in introducing changes in the way the system operates, enabling good prioritization, quick decision-making and high drive for results. On the other hand, the reliance on digital tools also revealed low digital literacy among health professionals, educators, social workers and parents, which calls for deeper investments in a comprehensive skills-gap analysis for different social workforces, identification of the appropriate learning and pedagogical approaches that are context specific and motivate people to adopt new ideas, and a holistic systems approach based on evidence and research. Quality of teaching, social protection services and community health services needs to be of top priority.

"
ECAR,Tajikistan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Innovation and technologies  
COVID-19, having demonstrated the importance of innovative approaches to learning and skills-building, triggered the adoption of technologies across the education sector globally. In contexts like Tajikistan, technology can allow actors like UNICEF to ensure that learning, skills acquisition, health, and other services continue to be accessible in emergencies. 
COVID-19 crisis paved the way for acceleration of UNICEF’s advocacy for engaging adolescents on online platforms. Throughout 2020, digital platforms such as TV channels were utilized to reach marginalized children who otherwise did not have access to learning opportunities. 
COVID-19 impacted the implementation of skills building programmes significantly.  Due to the closure of educational institutions, Innovation Labs were also closed. However, this also served as an opportunity for UNICEF to digitalize skills development module for online and offline delivery, adapting to the global initiative Reimagining Education within GIGA and GenU. 
Innovation Lab programme approaches have proven useful in the awareness-raising and identification of SGBV and GBV, allowing the referral of girls living with disabilities to existing support services. A local mechanism and pathway to address and support victims and their families with a culturally-sensitive approach should be developed. 
COVID-19 crisis also exacerbated issues surrounding mental health and psychological wellbeing, including for adolescents. An increased demand for psychosocial services was partly met on digital platforms by provision of online adolescent-friendly health services.
In summary, there is a clear understanding that UNICEF Tajikistan should further explore and capitalize on the lessons of the global pandemic. Building on its positioning within the country with government entities and stakeholders, UNICEF should lead the way to the greater use of data and evidence for children, with innovative solutions and technological advancements. 
Evidence and data 
2020 demonstrated the need for reliable evidence and for its use in advocacy and decision-making. Interestingly, this conclusion was reinforced in several instances. Firstly, the country programme evaluation completed in December 2020 highlighted that short-term emergency responses as well as overall development efforts should not only be multidimensional, responsive to the exigencies of the country’s dynamic context, but also that the use of limited public resources should be guided by evidence. 
Thus, during COVID-19 crisis UNICEF conducted an education rapid needs assessment that enabled planning and response with a clear understanding of needs, possibilities and constraints. This strengthened capacity in needs-assessment and needs-based planning – through the education rapid needs assessment and distance learning monitoring exercises, allowed UNICEF to identify needs during COVID-19 and encourage the MoES and development partners to distribute funding based on the specific needs of the education sector. The exercises will continue to ensure needs-based planning and allocation of resources during and beyond emergencies, and their mainstreaming across the education sector.  
Secondly, the evidence generated through piloting/modelling (early warning system, inclusive education, adolescent competency framework) clearly demonstrates the need to develop school-based mechanisms for improving access of the most marginalized, and the retention of students at risk of dropping out, with a focus on girls’ access to education. UNICEF will use this evidence to analyse the systemic and social norms which create barriers, and institutionalize the mechanisms and tools that prove effective as a result of modelling approach.  
Due to the lack of evidence-based data on certain nutritional outcomes and the poor nutrition surveillance system currently in place (which hinders in-depth analysis of the underlying and root causes of poor nutritional status), there are challenges in terms of timely informing of policy and decision-making on resource mobilization, particularly during emergencies. With the COVID-19 pandemic posing even greater challenges to the nutritional status of children, it is clear that new approaches should be developed for the strategic response to the country’s malnutrition issues with strengthened insights into disparate nutritional status among girls and boys. Similarly, having a system in place to generate reliable data on WASH in health facilities, linked to HMIS reflecting the progress on SDG WASH-related indicators, is vital to be able to make informed decisions and devise strategies keeping in view the progress and challenges faced.
UNICEF’s convening power 
COVID-19 posed enormous challenges in Tajikistan. It placed significant strains on the public health system and resulted in negative impacts across all socio-economic outcomes, and undone years of progress made by the state. It has increased the need to strengthen sectoral and multisectoral coordination, including among international actors, made it more vital to prioritize the most vulnerable, and to push for greater ownership by the government on developmental achievements. The crisis also made it clear that short-term responses are ineffective, especially in the contexts with insufficiently developed social services systems.
Hence, supporting the GoT to plan and respond to COVID-19, UNICEF used its convening power to advocate for  expansion of the response to the negative impact of COVID-19 beyond immediate actions to address systemic shortfalls. Thus, in Tajikistan’s National COVID-19 preparedness and response plan, UNICEF actively engaged in four key areas: i) protection of individuals from COVID-19, including RCCE, IPC and data collection and analysis; ii) minimization of morbidity/mortality including through rapid response, case management and continuity of essential services; iii) prevention of secondary impact, including in the sectors of health, education, nutrition, WASH, child and social protection; and iv) risk reduction and preparedness. 
Specifically, through procurement and distribution of PPE and lifesaving equipment, a monitoring system for health-related supplies, UNICEF and the MoHSPP ensured continuation of essential health care and nutrition services and moved to IPC as a more sustainable solution to health emergencies.  Moreover, UNICEF cooperated with the MoHSPP in developing a social protection response plan and resource mobilization for its implementation. UNICEF and the MoES led the development of the National Education Response Plan for COVID-19, including “Back to School Strategy”, which provided guidance on safe return to schools creating an enabling environment for all, including most vulnerable, students. The funding raised through UNICEF advocacy will be instrumental in improving country’s education system with provision of technological solutions and access to distance learning platforms. Overall, UNICEF’s proactive position and support to GoT bolstered its image among stakeholders in Tajikistan. "
ECAR,Türkiye,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"As 2020 is the last year of the programme cycle UNICEF Turkey has drawn on the Country Programme Evaluation (CPE) and the external evaluation of the CCTE programme, both completed in 2020. 
The CPE found that “UNICEF has successfully applied humanitarian-development ‘nexus’ thinking to its programme in Turkey – and that it has in the process designed some creative and innovative approaches to addressing the challenges involved. There are lessons here for others in UNICEF working in UMIC [Upper Middle-Income Country] contexts”.
The CCTE evaluation recognized the success of the programme and its innovative nature, recommending “that other countries hosting refugees integrate social protection, child protection and education programming from the start, and maximize efficiency by using existing and shared platforms. In middle and upper-middle income countries with strong infrastructure like Turkey, if it is possible to work through national systems and in parallel with national social protection programmes, this approach could facilitate sustainability, social cohesion and child protection as seen with the CCTE”.
The CPE also found that “the UNICEF Country Office has tried to address gender issues both through a set of specific gendered programme priorities, and through an integration approach and efforts to make systems gender responsive. While the gendered programme elements appear to the ET to have been appropriate and largely effective, it is less clear whether integration and mainstreaming efforts have worked”. In response to this, the new Country Programme more clearly spells out its gender mainstreaming approach and foresees an expansion of gender capacity in the office. 
The CPE also highlighted the importance of sustainability for the gains achieved in the short and medium term. “Addressing the wider sustainability issues for the programme, and ensuring continued progress on the child development agenda, will require UNICEF to address more consistently the Public Finance for Children (PF4C) agenda.” The new CPD has an explicit focus on public finance for children, with increased technical capacity in the office and new partnerships aiming to influence national and local budget allocations and their efficient use.  
Finally, the CPE found that “a more coherent and consistent approach to influencing relevant social norms and to promoting social cohesion” is needed. Therefore the PSN for the new programme cycle focuses on influencing social norms, including social cohesion, and one UNSDCF outcome has been dedicated to social cohesion and support to the national harmonization strategy. The new CPMP foresees an expansion in C4D human resources capacity.
 
The critical importance of prioritizing the adolescent age group with an integrated approach to learning, engagement and skills development was another key lesson learnt, now embedded in the new CPD with a dedicated Outcome area on adolescent development. Laying the groundwork for the new CPD, in 2020 adolescents were the focus of a series of innovative initiatives aimed at ensuring social inclusion, learning and engagement, including digitally, of the most vulnerable adolescents and young people.
The Accelerated Learning Programme (ALP), launched in 2018 by MoNE and UNICEF, supports out-of-school adolescents and youth to make up lost years of learning and transition into formal education. Since its inception it has reached nearly 25,000 adolescents ages 10-18 (48% girls) with a face-to-face modality.  In 2020 an online version of ALP was initiated. This online platform will ensure continuity of learning during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as during other emergencies, but it is also envisaged as a tool to reach greater numbers of out-of-school adolescents in Turkey, particularly girls, disabled young people and others who may face gender, geographic and other barriers to reaching physical ALP facilities.
Continuing to look for opportunities to innovate while leveraging the resources of the national education system in service of at-risk adolescents, whose enrolment rates are markedly lower than younger children, UNICEF and MoNE launched the “Schooling Adolescents through Vocational Education” Programme in 2020. The programme targets out-of-school refugee and Turkish adolescents through individual counselling provided by a team of Syrian Volunteer Education Personnel, school counselors and coordinators. Through SAVE, these adolescents receive individual guidance on the vocational education opportunities in Vocational Education Centers (part of the formal education system), where they acquire practical knowledge and skills through a combination of classroom and workplace learning (including technical and vocational skills), while earning a stipend equal to at least one third of the minimum wage, which can help reduce the economic barriers to their participation in education. The innovative aspect of this programme is two-fold. On one hand the individualized approach is critical, considering that lack of access to adequate information and guidance on how to navigate TVET opportunities is one of the key bottlenecks, especially among refugees and other socio-economically marginalized groups. On the other hand, this individualized approach can be brought to scale in a cost-efficient manner as it builds on the existing resources of the national education system, capitalizing on a solid and well distributed workforce with adequate skills.
Together with partners, for the first time UNICEF also engaged on digital and 21st century skills development for adolescents beyond the formal education system, working together with the Southeast Anatolia Development (GAP) Administration and civil society and academic institutions to establish digital skills spaces known as “Maker” and “Innoba” ateliers. Although the COVID-19 pandemic affected the pace of implementation, a first cohort of 1,152 Turkish and Syrian adolescents were equipped with digital skills through trainings on coding, 3D design and robotics. The curricula for the ateliers were developed by Harran University, a local University in southeast Turkey, based on its research and local knowledge of the needs of young people in this particularly deprived area of Turkey. The initiative is innovative in that it uses digital skills acquisition as an opportunity for fostering social cohesion between young people from the refugee and host community and aims to support adolescent creativity and innovation while also potentially creating livelihood and development opportunities. In 2021 this initiative will be scaled up through the expansion of the digital skill workshops in other centers belonging to the Ministry of Youth and Sports.

ECAR,Turkmenistan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Long-term transformational planning
UNICEF engagement in long-term strategic planning and scenario building since 2018 aimed at planning for impact beyond one country programme. The ten-year action plan of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection for development of social service and social services workforce developed by UNICEF in 2018 generated a clear, strategic and practical evidence-based advocacy agenda for UNICEF to follow. It laid the base for the SDG Fund Joint programme that started its work in 2020 with UNICEF leading and joining forces with UNDP, UNFPA, and UNODC, and having an ambitious goal to accelerate strategic change over the course of two years, that would otherwise require 5-7 years. Another example is the operational plan for introduction of universal pre-primary education (2018), and constant advocacy which resulted in Government adopting in 2020 the National Program for improving the activities of preschool institutions in the field of early development and pre-primary preparation of children in Turkmenistan for 2020-2025. This program incorporated the costed options under UNICEF supported operational plan for introducing one-year quality pre-primary preparation for all 5 years old children which is the country’s commitment under SDG 4.2.
UNICEF contributed to the implementation of country obligations on climate change and environment issues by supporting the Ministry of Education to incorporate the Climate Change, Environment and Energy Curriculum (CCEE) into the primary and secondary education of Turkmenistan. CCEE curriculum was approved in 2019 and was supported in 2020 by capacity development of experts and decision-makers responsible for pre- and in-service training of teachers in the country aiming at the longer-term curriculum implementation and monitoring, shifting teaching paradigms towards more active learning methodologies. In addition, UNICEF initiated the development of a “Green School” concept for a school that creates clean, healthy, protective and green surroundings while saving energy, environmental and resources. While this concept is still under discussion and development with the Ministry of Education and other national partners, the next steps for this work envisaged in 2021 aim at modelling green and renewable energy with its potential to improve the wellbeing and learning outcomes of school children, impacting the school environment and WASH in schools.
 
Strategic evaluations 
In 2020 UNICEF completed the Evaluation of the Government of Turkmenistan’s Strategy on Early Childhood Development. The evaluation aimed at pitching the findings at a strategic policy level, going beyond UNICEF interventions and looking at the systemic changes in the country. 
The evaluation had both learning and accountability dimensions, including (i) Learning and improved decision-making  through identification of lessons learned and good practices to support ECD policy; (ii) capacity development of government and other stakeholders in ECD; (iii) accountability for UNICEF interventions in terms of contribution to ECD policy and its implementation. This double-fold purpose ensured evaluation’s formative and summative dimensions. The evaluation was timely as in December 2019 Turkmenistan approved its next ECD Strategy for 2020-2025 and throughout the year UNICEF supported the government in development of its action plan and M&E framework. 
The findings of the ECD evaluation identified that, the ECD policy was highly relevant to the needs of the young children and families, although had a limited focus on the needs of the most marginalized groups. It informs that the policy design practice in the country should include more participatory approaches and go beyond the central-level consultations. The ECD interventions in both health and education provided by the government institutions have potential for replicability, but the overall amount of investments allocated should be increased to bring them to scale. Despite the strong political commitment for ECD policy sustainability in the country, the financial sustainability remains an issue. This has provided evidence of strategic importance, which could be further used to engage in closer cooperation with the Ministry of Finance and Economy and the line ministries on integrated and programme-based budgeting and financing.
 
Increased focus on RCCE and expanded partnerships and reach
Throughout 2020, risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) was a key area of work for UNICEF which not only led to expanding the existing engagement but also to engaging with new partners to reach families.  
ECD messages, that were jointly designed with the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education as part of the Work Plan with the State Committee for TV, Radio Broadcasting and Cinematography and Women’s Union, were aired via dedicated radio programmes. A series of visits to different regions of Turkmenistan was organized by UNICEF jointly with Women’s Union in February 2020 to receive feedback and identify additional channels for reaching parents and caregivers. 
As a result, the lessons learned assisted in partnering with the most popular TV host in Turkmenistan from the children’s daily show and helped in production of series of videos with RCCE messages led by UNICEF as part of the Country’s Response and Preparedness Plan to COVID-19.  Additionally, a series of animations were developed and aired together with adapted global UNICEF and IFRC animations. The video products were widely used by national partners and shared on social media. This important cooperation established with the State TV Committee and Women’s Union will be further used in 2021 to engage with parents and caregivers. 
Distribution of these video and animated materials to all 1,868 schools across the country and further engagement with the Ministry of Education with a Handwashing Campaign, proved schools to be the one of the best channels to reach out to children and their parents. 
Finally, the new partnership with Ministry of Sport and Youth Policy through the development of national youth programme and its action plan will be another channel to reach out to parents of adolescents and youth, accelerating its impact through the youth as a next generation of parents and caregivers.
Some of the channels that are opening due to COVID-related RCCE such as the National Red Crescent Society and its volunteer network, SMS messaging, and online platforms have great potential to be explored further for reaching out to parents and children on other critical areas for their wellbeing and children's best development. "
ECAR,Ukraine,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"     COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted the situation of many  girls and boys and their families, soon revealing the lack of capacity within  the Government in designing and implementing relevant response measures,  including needs-based budgeting and social protection of the most vulnerable  people. Time-sensitive evidence generation coupled with a good understanding  of the specific context proved to be the prerequisites for designing policy  measures. The non-availability of an updated census and social development  data coupled with limited evidence-based decision-making processes hampered  the Government to make informed decisions. Continuous advocacy and capacity  development in supporting state’s data collection systems to register all  vulnerable groups of the population and produce quality data on their  situation in order to address equity gaps, are critical. 
   
  Where the data is not available, the Government should be encouraged to use  evidence produced by development partners. As an example, the early impact  study of COVID-19 on poverty, including child poverty, enabled UNICEF, not  only to be able to advocate with the Government at the highest level for  enhanced gender sensitive social protection measures, but also to be a key  player on social protection. UNICEF’s immediate advocacy on the protection  risks of 42,000 girls and boys - most of them from vulnerable families and/or  with special needs – sent back from institutions coupled with the child  poverty analysis triggered the President of Ukraine to meet with UNICEF and  commit full support for de-institutionalization reform.
   
  COVID-19 pandemic also boosted the demand for funding and financing due to  the growing level of poverty and vulnerabilities among children and  vulnerable groups. As the Government did not possess enough financial  resources due to changing priorities and reduced budget revenues,  complementary resource mobilization and optimization of state budget  expenditure are key. In future, UNICEF should have a stronger voice and  partnerships in leveraging resources and in making budgets efficient and  effective. At the same time, UNICEF financial resources supporting the humanitarian and recovery response in eastern Ukraine, but also supporting the on-going reforms at the national level allowed UNICEF to quickly respond to new emerging needs thanks to the flexibility of funding and/or the possibility to reprogram it. UNICEF is particularly thankful to the German Government BMZ & AA, USAID, OFDA, BPRM, Italy and EU/ECHO.
   
  Government’s commitment to continue with the reforms despite COVID-19 is  commendable. However, many ministries responsible for the provision of social  services underwent major changes at the highest level resulting in staffing  and structural adjustments affecting both policy development and  implementation. Moreover, the lack of strategic vision of the  decentralization reform resulted in services being abolished at the local level  without proper justification and replacement with others. This is  particularly true for children related social services. This situation  requires UNICEF to enter the reform process consultations and work with  stakeholders on different levels in minimizing the risks of reforms to the  well-being of children.
  
  While the COVID-19 pandemic challenged Ukraine, it also became a stimulus for  creative and innovative solutions to address new emerging needs. Many planned  face to face activities were shifted on-line, even large and complex events,  such as the High-Level Conference on “Social services for families with  children”. For other activities, a hybrid approach was chosen ensuring both  outreach and quality of the services. This is certainly true for the provision  of individual services, such as psycho-social consultations. 
  
  Digital technology and social media gave the opportunity to children and  young people to have their voice heard, and U-report was used extensively to  hear about their concerns, challenges and fears related to their future and  inform decision makers. Digitalization, however, has its limitations as it is  not spread evenly across the country with regions experiencing limited  internet connection, while vulnerable families are not able to afford ICT  equipment. This is also one of the lessons learnt from the distance learning  programme developed by MOES (and supported by UNICEF). Children from  vulnerable families and/or with special needs were excluded from it with no  alternative modalities proposed to them posing a major equity challenge.  Within the pace of digitalization, UNICEF has a critical role to play to  continue to advocate at all levels for the rights of children, in particular  for the most vulnerable, including those with special needs. 
  
  The response to the COVID-19 further highlighted the need for inter-sectorial  coordination and collaboration. From the onset of the response, UNICEF  advocated with line ministries to ensure a comprehensive approach. UNICEF  supported behaviour change communication on preventive measures becoming part  of the public response across all ministries responsible for social services  through tailormade messages addressing sector needs and targeted audience.  High-level advocacy with the Government resulted in IPC also being included  within the government health response, while becoming an another  cross-sectorial priority across UNICEF’s response. There are many more  examples of excellent advocacy done fostering inter sectoral collaboration,  such as the immediate measures taken by the Ministries of Social Policy and  Education related to the return of children from institutions.  
   
  In terms of business continuity, UNICEF shifted on the onset to teleworking  modality, however without much understanding for how long nor how this would  work. Over the time, the office came to the evidence that teleworking is  proving itself as viable option for ensuring operational continuity,  increased productivity and delivery of results, allowing a more “flexible”  schedule and the “freedom” to work from an alternative location. However,  experience shows - confirmed by the staff wellbeing survey conducted in June  - that teleworking brings also back-draws and risks: overwork impacting the  work-life balance equilibrium, increased demand on household chores and care  for children - particularly true for women – and feeling of isolation  (particularly for individuals living alone), and the loss of contact with  colleagues. So being better prepared for managing stress and having hobbies  outside of work for maintaining a work-life balance are key. Putting in place  regular and predicable communication with colleagues and teams, while  offering trainings and sessions with regional and local staff councilors is  equally critical to foster collaboration, trust and transparency, but also it  translates into a feeling of care towards others.

ESAR,Angola,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons learned:
Despite the many challenges, the COVID-19 context reinforced a more proactive move towards convergence and intersectoral teamwork at the programmatic level, rather than just geographical juxtaposition. The impact of school closures on children, families and communities and the link between the epidemiological situation and plans for school reopening created new opportunities for intersectoral coordination and partnership. The increased involvement of the Minister of State for Social Affairs in the COVID-19 response, and the multi-stakeholder technical working group for U-Report, show that the need for integration may be becoming more evident among government partners.

The pandemic necessitated remote working modalities to support communities with service delivery. UNICEF adopted innovative approaches to deliver services, such as payment to vaccinators/supervisors through mobile phone, and remote data collection for nutrition surveys and distance learning.

Municipal administrations and provincial governments have proven to be open to new approaches and have embraced the use of new virtual meeting platforms for capacity building purposes. This allowed, for example, for more than 300 staff from CASI and local partners in Bié, Moxico and Uige Provinces to be trained on COVID-19 prevention and socio-economic mitigation measures. This opens the door for a more flexible and tailored support package to partners at local level, which can be sustained in the future regardless of the emergency level and contribute to efficiency gains.

The COVID-19 crisis provided stark evidence that UNICEF needs to support continued investment in risk-informed programming and disaster risk reduction across multiple sectors. Weak coordination mechanisms and lack of deployable technical resources in many ministries, made rapid response to the pandemic difficult. 

COVID-19 can become an opportunity for reviewing public finance aspects with a social lens. It is however important to complement advocacy and capacity building activities at local and central level, joining efforts among key stakeholders including civil society, local and central government, development partners. A practice yielding good results in terms of sustainability has been to depart from the common areas of interest with key government partners, such as MINFIN, with the communication and budget literacy activities focused on youth and children.

In the context of decentralization, national strategies to further simplify birth registration procedures must be coupled with training of the professional workforce, mainstreaming the simplification procedures at all levels. In line with current strategies implemented by Ministry of Justice and Human Rights with support from UNICEF, a pool of trainers was formed at central level for easy deployment to provinces at a regular basis.
 
The negative impact on essential healthcare delivery and uptake during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Angola, triggered an increased recourse to different cadres of community health workers and community-based organizations to support communities among others in nutrition emergency response. The ADECOS programme led by the Ministry of Territorial Administration that was meant to be expanded progressively across the country stalled as a result of decreased funding. This prompted the Ministry of Health to consider developing a national community health policy and strategy for which a technical working group on community health has been set up with UNICEF as member. UNICEF sourced technical assistance from the University of Oslo to support the Ministry of Health develop a Community Health Information System that will be interoperable with the current DHIS2.

Innovation:
To enhance the accountability of provincial health departments on the correct use of lifesaving nutrition supplies provided to municipalities affected by drought and COVID-19, UNICEF set up a mobile digital platform using the KOBO-Collect application. This enables central and provincial health authorities to ensure timely reporting of nutrition indicators into the routine health management information system, including supply tracking up to the end user. For this to happen, UNICEF procured 260 mobile phones and distributed these to 176 nutrition treatment centres in Huila, Cunene, Bie and Luanda Provinces for data collection and entry to the project information system. This system enhances the quality, accuracy and timeliness of information concerning undernutrition during the COVID-19 pandemic and related lack of food supplies or loss of jobs by families.

UNICEF and partners were introduced an innovative GIS database to the CLTS monitoring system in Bié Province by reconciling sanitation issues with vulnerability at the village level. These may include women-headed households, households where older adults are responsible for grandchildren because parents died from HIV or left the village in search of livelihood. The system provides a clear map of where we have a vulnerable child with or without services. UNICEF’s interventions in Bié Province include sending life-saving messages to mothers and caregivers through the mHealth platform. The project combines two approaches: sending voice messages with information on neonatal care to mobile phones, and training of traditional birth attendants in safe delivery practices and neonatal care. The service automatically delivers two messages per week on topics like breastfeeding, prevention of diseases, nutrition and hygiene, during the first 6 months of the baby. 
 
UNICEF and partners transformed the COVID-19 context into an opportunity for innovation in the Cash Transfers projects. The projects replaced all paper-based operations with digital processes using offline data collection via tablets to aid the registration, confirmation and payment of beneficiaries. The electronic tools were pre-populated with data from the MIS system and pictures of all beneficiaries. The use of IT tools provided protection against the risk of infection for interviewers and beneficiaries, sped up processes, increased efficiency, enhanced security and mitigated the risk of fraud. 
 
UNICEF adjusted systems and processes in the COVID-19 context to ensure business continuity. Measures included transforming the processes into the e-format, adapting the electronic signatures and DocuSign, adjusted HR emergency procedures. The procedures/controls were discussed at CMT meetings and shared with all staff. UNICEF facilitated teleworking since March 2020; establishing a monitoring system to ensure results delivery as expected and maintain constant contact so that staff are aware of guidelines on international travel during COVID19 and return to duty station, adjustments of salaries and entitlements.
"
ESAR,Botswana,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the delivery of services for children and adolescents particularly during lockdowns where services were disrupted placing children under increased risk of violence, exploitation and abuse and without access to life-saving essential health services. Naturally, COVID-19 caused delays in some of the 2020 planned activities across the board, while country office efforts were refocused towards supporting the Government’s response planning and implementation, while still maintaining some level of momentum on other important interventions. 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic saw a shift in business as usual and demanded agility and flexibility, as well as expansion on the use of technology and innovation in the delivery of interventions. A key lesson learned in 2020 is that mainstreaming digitization, innovation and technology in programmes increases access to information and services, ensures that beneficiaries are reached during unreachable times, and improves the digital skills of the beneficiaries. Another key lesson learned is the importance of applying design-thinking and human-centred design approaches in the design and implementation of interventions, which not only ensures that services provided are relevant and impactful, but also increases youth engagement and participation, fostering ownership of interventions. A key challenge, however, is addressing the digital divide that exists among people, so that those in underserved areas are not left behind in the digitization of programming. In 2021, innovative and virtual approaches will be further intensified, inter-sectoral collaboration will be strengthened, and virtual peer education will be prioritized as one of the implementation strategies.
 
Given the newly developed digital transformation strategy in Botswana (referenced as SMART BOTS) there are ample opportunities for UNICEF to work with Government to enhance use of multimedia and digital platforms for engaging youth and adolescents engagement with children and young people, to strengthen civil registration and vital statistics, to expedite rollout the NIS, to develop cyber security related initiatives and school connectivity focusing on the marginalized and hard to reach children whilst remaining very careful not to accentuate the digital divide in the country.
 
Overall, the pandemic has demonstrated the ability for “business” to continue in some part, online. Engagement with Government is often undertaken online now, and oversight of interventions undertaken remotely. The Government’s increasing willingness to use online platforms and tools to interact, speaks volumes for the possibilities to be more innovative in dialogue and programming going forward. 
 
The importance of effective communication channels with government and non-government partners was no more evident than during 2020. The need for timely and regular information exchange on global/regional/national trends and policy responses aimed at mitigating the impact of the outbreak on children was crucial. Advocacy for a well thought-through national response was also crucial. The coordination of this even more so, given the number of actors’ intent on supporting Government. While UNICEF developed its own COVID-19 preparedness and response plan, this stemmed from Government priorities and fed into the wider UNCT plan. Frequent and deliberate engagement within the UNCT, as well as between the UNCT and other development partners became the norm in a way it had not been before. This enhanced UN credibility and saw Government incrementally open up to UN involvement. While not for the first time, UNICEF worked even more closely with other agencies in its response as has been attested to under “partnerships” and presented the UN agencies with opportunities to achieve greater impact by pooling resources.
 
Being able to provide Government and other development partners with emergency expertise, be it national, regional or global, has seen UNICEF increasingly become a partner of choice in a number of areas. This was very evident within the education sector where UNICEF was called “to the table” frequently to guide the approach to ensuring that children’s education was compromised as little as possible during the pandemic. It is also safe to say, therefore, the fact that Botswana was one of the first countries in Africa to reopen its schools, was in no small amount due to UNICEF advocacy and support.
 
As a result of a continually strengthened partnership with the Ministry of Basic Education and development partners, UNICEF will – going forward – co-chair the national education development partners forum with the EU delegation. This is a great recognition of the leadership and added value of UNICEF in the education space in Botswana.
 
UNICEF’s work within the UN/Government initiative on developing a socio protection recovery framework led to expansion of stakeholder inclusion, as well as increased interest in child-sensitive social protection issues in Botswana. This also showed that a more coordinated approach with other UN agencies is instrumental in promoting and influencing social policy reform agenda that will positively impact children. 
 
The poor data landscape and weak real-time data collection tools posed several challenges including missed opportunities for timely intervention and decision-making by policy makers, particularly inequitable and disproportionate public resource allocation. UNICEF tapped its expertise in the technology for development space to support the Government in designing an online data collection platform for household assessments. Undertaking a COVID-19 data landscape analysis also provides the foundation for a potential future focus for UNICEF to more systematically support the Government strengthen quality data generation and analysis.
 
Fairly regular turnover in senior Government positions, with cabinet reshuffling as well as the move of Permanent Secretaries does pose challenges for continuity of work. With several high-level positions shifting during 2020, it was often difficult to gain access to decision makers and maintain momentum in interventions advocacy efforts, during a time when a position was newly filled and portfolio orientation a higher priority than engaging with UN partners. Nonetheless, the technical level engagement which is strong between UNICEF and the Government ensures some level of continuity, albeit with key decisions remaining pending and some progress delays in areas. 
 
UNICEF in consultation with government partners suspended some programmatic interventions due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, including capacity developing and field monitoring activities. However, some programme monitoring visits were instead conducted online, ensuring that oversight continued despite restrictions to physical presence.

ESAR,Burundi,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"1.1.     Learning from private sector engagement: The magnitude and nature of the partnership with Savonor was a first for UNICEF in Burundi and hence offers many lessons: ·       Combining strengths to achieve common goals:  The overall experience with Savonor was marked by professionalism and efficiency. Its capacity to produce at scale was instrumental to the successful attainment of the project’s objectives. Savonor contributed its technological and organization capacities, as well as access to its markets, while UNICEF provided financial assets, facilitated stakeholder dialogues and did the advocacy work. This dynamic suggests that partnerships between humanitarian/development organizations and private enterprises could play an important role in achieving a set of common objectives. Despite having different interests and objectives, by pooling complementary capacities and resources, the collaboration had the desired outcome. Hence UNICEF is exploring other models of private-public partnerships to provide services at scale.

1.2.    Continued access to basic services during a pandemic – testing adaptive capacities:
·       The Maternal and Child Health Weeks in Burundi (MCHW) are usually held twice yearly to help the most vulnerable children catch up on services. In 2020, they took place in July after much consultation and discussion with MoH and other partners. A major lesson from the innovative approach used for the MCHWs is that it was possible to conduct a door-to-door strategy, even during the COVID-19 pandemic, with 10,238 community health workers (CHWs) The campaign reached nearly 100% of its target (children 6-59 months), a major improvement from the previous approach. As the country is contemplating an exit strategy vis-à-vis campaigns that are costly, using CHWs in addition to the routine system could be a viable alternative. 

1.3.    The multisectoral nutrition package needs to be reinforced with more nutrition-sensitive interventions (WASH, ECD, social protection) and extended to over 80% of districts (from 19% currently) to accelerate the trend in stunting reduction. Therefore, it is critical to effectively implement the newly validated national strategy, backed with high level political commitment, including mobilization of resources. Involvement of all implementing partners, especially private, is also critical.
At the sectoral reviews with MoH and key implementing partners (November 2020), all parties were pleased with the excellent collaboration and good performance of the programme. All planned direct cash transfers were within the requisite three-month time frame, which is a proof of better ownership of the programme by all partners, including the Government.

1.4.    The relevance of innovation and digital technology to fragile contexts – not only a possibility but a necessity – 
·       The movement restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic pushed UNICEF to implement an innovative approach to continue engaging with adolescents and delivering the skills-building programme. The use of U-Report was brought to another level. Moving beyond a participation tool, the contents of the skills programme were simplified and delivered through the U-Report platform. The participation of Burundian adolescents in online youth challenges organized at global level demonstrated their interest and eagerness to access new opportunities for learning. It however showed that access to devices and the need for additional facilitation are barriers limiting adolescents’ equitable access to such opportunities. To address these issues, UNICEF acquired 1,200 tablets and is working on designing a blended learning skills programme that will be delivered through online and face-to-face methodology by making tablets available to groups of adolescents in solidarity groups. UNICEF is working with different partners, such as the Embassy of the Netherlands, to make digital learning platforms such as Atingi available to adolescents in Burundi. Adolescent entrepreneurs will access Yoma, a digital marketplace that will enable them to showcase products and gain access to regional markets. 
·       In partnership with Cartedo and 14 community-level youth organizations, UNICEF Burundi joined the COVID-19 Youth Challenge which aims to give a voice to adolescents; explore ideas to solve real challenges; and empower people and communities to become pandemic-resilient. A total of 1,722 adolescents (50% girls) joined the challenge. Burundian adolescents recorded the highest completion rate with 670 solutions designed and submitted on the platform. The top five solutions designed by adolescents were announced by the Minister of Youth during the International Day of Youth and UNICEF provided seed grants for their implementation while NGO partners ensured coaching. Solutions designed by adolescents included development of an online platform to ensure learning continuation and the creation of a rainwater filter.  This was also an opportunity to showcase that, unlike the popular myth in Burundi, girls are not only interested in technology but can work with it effectively as three of the winners were girls.  
·       Increasing the use of beneficiary-focused information for decision-making has been a priority in 2020. To increase the office’s accountability to affected populations (AAP), the country office has deployed a new Integrated Monitoring System to ensure that the voices of beneficiaries are at the center of monitoring and decision-making processes. The integrated system, which is in its pilot phase, ensures the availability of real-time data collected directly from communities and beneficiaries thanks to the integration of monitoring platforms such as U-Report and ONA. In 2020, 1,164 interviews with Merankabandi’s beneficiaries were conducted and data visualized real-time in ONA; 18 U-Reports have been launched and 18,820 respondents have participated. The system will enter its scaling-up phase in 2021.

ESAR,Comoros,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Undoubtedly, the biggest lessons came from the outbreak of the Covid pandemic. Service delivery was disrupted in all sectors. Prevention measures against the disease rendered difficult or even impossible the implementation of scheduled activities. In this context, the mobilization of the country's resources was focused on the response to covid 19. When trying to advance sectoral progress, the country was faced with serious problems of institutional arrangement and strategic visions in all sectors.
With UNICEF and its partner on lockdown, remote work became the norm. within the CO, despite the willingness of the Management to prioritize the well-being of its staff, the lack of face-to-face interactions seems to have decelerated the sharing of best practices that would have added to the capacity building of the staff.
In this context, UNICEF and its partners had to innovate with interventions adapted to the local reality.
The ban on international travel made it impossible to conduct vaccine equipment maintenance as schedule. Quarterly corrective maintenance mission by the national logistics team proved to be positive as it offered an additional opportunity for supervision on different aspects of vaccine logistics. Vitamin supplementation was reinforced through routine services, breastfeeding promotion messages, organization of the vitamin A supplementation campaign at community level through the door-to-door strategy. With the Brachial Perimeter initiative, mothers were involved in the screening for SAM and the follow-up of children under treatment.
In the WASH sector, solar pumps were installed in community cisterns and health facilities across the country. This contributed in reducing the risk of contamination of the water and the use of physical force, especially for women, to draw the water. Also, simple and less expensive technologies for households were used for the construction of improved toilets (these are the molds available in the targeted districts, the siphons and other inputs), while ensuring transfer of knowledge to local artisans.
Community approach proved to be an effective strategy for promoting and sustaining efforts for the development of preschool, provided that the various stakeholders take proper ownership of it. Thus the awareness-raising actions carried out with the parents' association called Scol action have had a strong impact in raising parents' awareness.
In the context of community health, measuring mid upper arm circumference (MUAC) by mothers, the identification of suspected cases while respecting barrier measures and reporting them through phone calls or other telephone applications, are all measures that have helped health workers in the management of the COVID19 pandemic.
 
Looking forward, UNICEF Comoros intends to put the lessons and innovations from 2020 to good use in future actions.
In order to keep supporting the education sector, an analysis of adaptation capacities shows that the Comorian education system has development assets, especially in the search for alternative learning paths to cushion the adverse effects of a pandemic on education. However, these capacities were used informally and on a very small scale during the interruption of educational activities from March to July 2020. The survey shows that households can have electricity at home (88%), and have a television (76%), radio (56%) and internet (39%). However, national radio and television coverage reaches 52% for TV and 58% for radio. This situation requires collaboration with other peripheral radio and television stations to broaden the scope of access to distance education.
In addition, despite the positive results achieved with UNICEF advocacy (making available the database from radio and TV channels), there is a need for clarification of roles and responsibilities regarding resource management and accountability for the operationalization of intersectoral collaboration.
With teleworking becoming more and more a default way of work, it will be necessary to strengthen the means and skills of communication of UNICEF staff and government partners to enable them to keep up with this trend.
In the health sector, focus will be put on maternal and neonatal health, and on setting up quality services that are resilient to various hazards, including epidemics and humanitarian crises. Emphasis will be placed also on the development of normative documents and guidelines for the quality assurance of care, for prevention of infections in maternity and neonatal services, for the training of staff on the care of newborns and on kangaroo mother care. 
The implementation of the community health strategy in the context of the COVID 19 pandemic has shown that CHWs have an adaptive capacity that must be put to good use. However, it will be necessary to have a strong and regular coordination mechanism, because despite the goodwill of the various partners, overlaps and insufficient harmonization of interventions have been observed.
Having obtained early and satisfactory funding for vaccines in 2020, the support and commitment of Unicef ¿¿are now directed towards the setting up of mechanisms that would help secure predictable and sustainable funding for immunization in particular and for health in general.
In the area of public finance, there is a need on the part of the CO to rethink the intervention strategy, and to renew the efforts of partnership and collaboration among the UN agencies, as well as between them and the Bretton Woods institutions, in order to work with the government in a coherent approach.
Looking back at the challenges for national institutions to respond to humanitarian situations with monetary transfer interventions, there is a crucial need to have a dynamic multi-hazard contingency plan that can serve as a reference document for the mobilization of external and internal resources. Moreover, long-term partnership agreements must be established with the telephone operators who already offer electronic money services. It should be possible to work with them especially when in-person remittance of the money would prove inapplicable.
Discussions with the victims of violence highlighted trauma as a source of vulnerability, which had not been taken into account in the planning of social protection interventions. Coming very often from poor and vulnerable families, these victims also need psychological and financial support to help them cope with the trauma, build self-confidence, and get on with their lives.
"
ESAR,Eritrea,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Prior to school closures in April 2020, the strategy of UNICEF and its implementing partners focused on empowering communities to demand quality education services and strengthening their engagement in both the provision of learning spaces and learning opportunities for out-of-school children and youth (OOSCY). The strategy yielded significant results which helped to provide for the educational needs for 12,060 (5,300 females) learners in formal and non-formal programs. The completion of the construction of 124 primary level classrooms with funding from the GPE as well as the expansion of the reach of complementary elementary education program (CEE) through establishing 22 additional CEE centers, an intervention to cater the educational needs of overaged OOSCY, testifies the achievement of the approach. 
 
This approach will be expanded and strengthened to mitigate the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 on the education sector, tackling school drop-out and learning loss likely to exacerbate the country’s learning crisis ¿ especially given the country’s widespread digital divide. Unequal access to digital tools was a major hurdle for schools and teachers seeking to engage students in distance learning during the pandemic. The difficulty in developing educational programmes for broadcast on radio and TV to reach primary school learners, due to limited pool of service providers, stalled efforts to ensure children’s learning and engagement during COVID-19-related school closures. The MoE is now focused on addressing the digital divide and building capacity at its media education center. This represents an emerging opportunity for UNICEF to support and ensure the delivery of catch-up programmes, integrating media and ICT-based technologies to facilitate remote and distance learning and supplement organized in-school instructions when schools reopen.  
 
Community-based child protection networks were only semi-active during the pandemic, which affected the provision of child protection services. Strengthening the capacity of these community-based networks, particularly on child protection in emergencies (CPiE), by imparting minimum standards of knowledge and understanding of CPiE and the required skills, is instrumental to addressing child protection issues during emergencies. UNICEF learned during the COVID-19 pandemic that programmes should explore alternative communication channels both to disseminate key messages and to enable learning opportunities for child protection and education professionals when faced with restrictions on travel and face-to-face encounters. 
 
UNICEF’s agile response to the pandemic strengthened trust on the part of the GoSE. The RCCE focused on systems-strengthening and mainstreaming of risk communication in policies, as well as its development of an integrated action plan, yielded effective results reaching over 80% of the population with one directional messaging using radio and television and 1.4 million people through community engagement mechanisms[1]. Capacity building targeting journalists, health promoters and multi-sectoral programming partners resulted in successful collaboration and effective coordination at all levels, from central to community. Further, in preparation for school opening, the RCCE group’s engagement with the education-in-emergencies taskforce was focused on offering key messages, guidance, tools, education communication and information and co-curricular supplementary support for children/teachers ¿ all aimed at building community trust in school safety. 
 
Despite limited internet availability and lack of WiFi access, the RCCE committee supported the MoH to develop an innovative, android-based offline application containing information on COVID-19 prevention, continuity of health care services and support for schools. The application includes information on reproductive, maternal, neonatal, nutrition, child and adolescent health services adapted to the COVID-19 context. The application also aims at providing information for health workers on IPC and self-care. The COVID-19 self-diagnostics application was linked to the 24/7 Call Centre to facilitate contact tracing, reporting and seeking treatment and care. The application includes reminders and a timed 20-second handwashing function. It will also inform caretakers about immunization and ante-natal care schedules, which can be generated using the offline application. 
 
The application was also used as an interactive information-sharing platform to supplement the ongoing COVID-19 prevention campaign. 300,000 mobile phone users were targeted, enabling a larger percentage of the population to receive information and content about COVID-19 and changes at health services. 
 
In the Eritrea context of limited and progressively dwindling funding, the only way to achieve the very ambitious targets of the Sustainable Development Goals is to apply integrated, evidence-based strategies and approaches at the community level. The focus must be on building capacity and strengthening systems to build resilience to shocks and ensure sustainability.  This requires UNICEF to shift from funding programme implementation to a more technical and strategic oversight role, using any available funding as catalytic and leveraging additional resources, both external and local. 
 
The office relied on use virtual means to ensure continuity of the governance structure and manage program effectiveness during the lockdown through regular scheduling of virtual programme management committee (PMC), CMT and CrMT tools during most of the year. PMC,CMT and CrMT meetings remained flexible, allowing for adjustments to accommodate the changing needs of the office, facilitate discussion of potential programme adjustments, brainstorming to unlock bottlenecks (e.g., customs clearance for programme supplies) in addition to exploring opportunities for further integration of programmes to expedite and improve the efficiency of programme implementation.
 
UNICEF’s monthly bulletin on COVID response was an effective 2020 innovation that provided an overview of its ongoing support for critical health, nutrition, WASH, child and social protection and RCCE work. The bulletin was shared with resident and regional embassies and much- appreciated by partners.

ESAR,"ESARO, Kenya",Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The unprecedented experience of programming and sustaining operations during a global pandemic demanded a daunting degree of adaptation, innovation and learning on the part of every individual staff member. Sections adjusted to the new way of working while ESARO overall found ways to perform as a collective team. Mid-year and annual reviews during 2020 served as key opportunities for reflection and documenting lessons learned of these unprecedented times.  
 
·       While ESARO’s support to COs’ immediate, short-term interventions was very effective, mid- to long-term planning and preparedness for secondary impacts are equally crucial to the overall response. However, due to time pressures and the all-encompassing nature of the pandemic, preparedness for the next phase of addressing COVID-19 was not developed equally across the sectors, which will be corrected in 2021.
 
·       The importance of having emergency preparedness plans in each section of ESARO was underlined in 2020; good practices helped the agility of response. For example, the communication section had a range of messages developed in preparation, which could be used swiftly to suit different occasions. Practice drills of what-to-do-when also contributed to a swift response. Ready-made emergency tools and familiar standard operating procedures were also crucial for a quick and coherent response. A coherent, office-wide emergency preparedness narrative and strategy are needed, along with updated guidance, SOPs and tools. 
 
·       ESARO gained some vital lessons from its Real-Time Assessment of COVID-19 response at the country-level. It has highlighted the need to strengthen preparedness and emergency response; the need for more flexible funding; the need to simplify procedures to make new partnerships easy to establish in emergencies; the need to continue innovations; and the need to improve data availability on vulnerable populations.
 
·       The lessons that emerged in 2020 are valued by ESARO and must be embedded in specific actions. An office-wide strategy is needed to allow continuous learning about performance. Equally, a knowledge management strategy, particularly for emergency response, is called for. The momentum and flexibility behind ESARO’s achievements in 2020 are celebrated and need to be maintained, while analysis of both structural and procedural changes will be undertaken to understand precisely which elements contributed to which aspects of success.  
 
·       The pandemic necessitated several changes in business practices, such as streamlined processes within ESARO and reduced and targeted communication with COs. Some of these changes have emerged as good practices and should be continued as the world recovers from this crisis. New ways of working experienced need to be embedded in ESARO’s culture and behaviour, with frequent feedback to retain relevance and agility. 
 
·       The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the criticality of supply chains to the world and created momentum to optimize and strengthen supply chain systems. ESARO will accelerate these activities in the region, which are critical for the planned COVAX implementation and emergency preparedness for the future.
 
·       The challenges faced in 2020 demonstrated the importance of local partners, especially since many international organizations were unable to maintain a field presence in this hour of crisis. ESARO needs to work with COs to invest in identifying and building the capacity of local partners and finding alternative ways to deliver results.  
 
·       The importance of partnerships was highlighted in the context of the COVID-19. Trusted existing relationships were strengthened and mobilized, while new partnerships were identified and galvanized, for example with the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, which emerged as a critical pandemic response partner. 
 
·       Finally, clear lessons were learned on the importance of mobilizing and leveraging the political support of regional and sub-regional organizations, and influencers. Ties were strengthened with the AU and RECs, which had significant influence on national policies, including on school reopening and cross-border movement of people and goods. Advocacy for reopening schools also mobilized joint actions among the Regional Directors of WHO, UNICEF and UNESCO, while UNDS coordination platforms were utilized to coordinate the United Nation’s response to dual crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic and multiple sub-regional conflicts.

"
ESAR,Eswatini,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The main challenges faced this year were related to the complexities presented by COVID-19 pandemic. The crisis could have exposed UNICEF staff to major risks, thus affecting continuity of operation. The pandemic further highlighted the importance of the corporate preparedness measures, such as Emergency Preparedness Plan (EPP) and the Business Contiguity Plan (BCP). In the beginning of the year 2020, UNICEF Eswatini had successfully updated and tested its BCP. This helped the office to promptly adapt its operation to the rapidly changing context and continue providing support to partners and communities without interruption. In the year 2021 UNICEF Eswatini, will, therefore, invest more in ensuring systems such as Enterprise Governance Risk and Compliance (eGRC), EPP and BCP. The Office had also recently responded to an emergency caused by climate change. Staff members experienced in emergency response were used as an effective asset to help develop a strong response plan and implement it. In the upcoming Country Programme (2021-2025) UNICEF Eswatini will focus on strengthening its emergency response by investing in capacity development for staff.
 
In the initial stages of the pandemic restrictions in access to partners and communities negatively impacted implementation. Gaps in some partners’ preparedness prevented Eswatini from taking the necessary measures to respond to and mitigate the impact of COVID-19. Learning from this, UNICEF Eswatini which was in the process of developing its next Country Programme introduced stronger elements of capacity development for emergency preparedness and response into the 2021-2025 Programme. The global pandemic, COVID-19, exposed vulnerabilities of systems across programme areas, hence the urgent need for strengthening emergency preparedness and response as an integral component of all programs to build resilient systems and to build back better in the recovery phase of the current humanitarian situation including investing in innovative approaches, mental health and psychosocial programmes for all sectors.
 
The Pandemic also highlighted the absence of an effective, inclusive and risk-informed social protection system. This also motivated UNICEF Eswatini to place stronger focus on this programme area and ensure that social protection is introduced into its cooperation programme with government as a prominent component focusing on Child-sensitive budgeting, Child-sensitive policies and establishing a shock-responsive, child-focused social protection system.
 
To respond to COVID-19 crisis, the Government activated a national emergency coordination mechanism which at the initial stages was not able to speedily reach all partners with information regarding needs and progress of work. This resulted in a generally slow response, especially in early stages. UNICEF actively participated in the coordination forums to advocate for issues affecting children and focus on continuity of services. To contribute in the coordination, UNICEF supported an internal synergistic information sharing mechanism in areas of Education, Nutrition, WASH and Child Protection with other UN Agencies

Another example of the instrumental role of strengthening coordination mechanisms in emergencies was in the area of health and more specifically on HIV and TB. To leverage domestic resources for child health, improve coordination, accountability and integration of services including COVID-19, UNICEF continued to facilitate monthly meetings with the Ministry of Health senior management team where implementation progress was reviewed, and prompt action taken where required. The establishment of a weekly coordination meeting to address the impact of COVID19 on HIV and TB was key to avoid disruption of services and ensure continuity of access to services for people living with HIV and TB.
 
Targeted and effective responses to the needs of children affected by COVID-19, particularly children whose parents were hospitalized, remained a challenge throughout the response. The lack of coordination led to a delay in an inclusive response for children, including the poor provision of mental health and psychosocial support to affected children. UNICEF together with its partners will invest in better coordination in the year 2021 to ensure a comprehensive response is given, with attention to the most vulnerable children.
 
Limited accurate and routine data on vulnerable children, including insufficient data on VAC and GBV, education, and health indicators was a major obstacle to providing the necessary support to children and women in need. UNICEF is currently supporting partners such as DPMO and MOET to set up a routine, real-time information management systems that will support the country to better respond to issues of child protection, social protection, education and health, including in emergencies. In 2021, UNICEF will further prioritize these programmes.
 
The COVID-19 crisis demonstrated the importance of introduction of alternative forms of service delivery. For instance, the traditional face-to-face learning alone could not be adequate to withstand complex humanitarian situations such as pandemics. UNICEF and its partners soon started investing in alternative forms of education such as blended learning. In 2021 investment in online learning and strengthening its monitoring through innovative ways will increase. The importance of leveraging community structures for child health outcomes was critical for building resilient communities, as demonstrated by the response to COVID-19 pandemic. Uptake of Maternal and Newborn Child Health services declined due to travel restrictions and lockdowns which prevented mothers and general populace from seeking healthcare. UNICEF in collaboration with community volunteers assisted in bringing information and vital health services at people’s doorsteps through door-to-door campaigns and outreach initiatives.
 
Another lesson learnt during the pandemic is adopting new ways of working and engaging with adolescents and young people such as through social media, with a real interest from young people to participate and actively engage in the response. This momentum will be further strengthened for strong engagement of young people as change agents. UNICEF will continue its support to innovative ways for adolescent and youth engagement in 2021 and the years after.

In general, as elaborated above, the Country Office invested a great deal in Technology for Development (T4D) in the reporting period. This calls for developing a T4D strategy for the Country programme in 2021 which not only captures opportunities, but also gives direction to the efforts of UNICEF in this area and ensures adequate attention is placed on issues such as data safety, privacy and confidentiality.
"
ESAR,Ethiopia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"     
Every Child Survives and Thrives
Health – The importance of joint high-level UN advocacy and engagement with the Government was evidenced in achieving results for children. 2020 was constrained by the COVID-19 pandemic that affected the delivery of services like immunization to children. The Ministry of Health had decided to cancel the combined measles and polio supplementary immunization activity (SIA) scheduled for April 2020. Following joint advocacy by the heads of UNICEF and WHO in Ethiopia with the Minister of Health, and a commitment to support the protection of health workers to carry out the campaign, it was successfully held. 
  
UNICEF procured and distributed PPE to health workers and supported social mobilization activities while WHO provided the technical assistance and supported planning. This joint effort led to the reinstatement of the campaign, and its successful implementation in July reaching 15 million children (96 per cent of the target).  
   
UNICEF invested early on and with significant technical support in helping EPHI/MOH during COVID on supply management and reporting (PPE and essential items national dashboard) and on risk communication reaching 46,551,403 people. This capacity will need to be maintained for the effective management of future shocks. 
      
Nutrition - Throughout 2020, UNICEF’s focus was on improving access to nutrition services. An End-User Monitoring system was launched in September 2020 to assess the quality of nutrition services and satisfaction of mothers and caregivers. Even though more than 80 per cent of the beneficiaries expressed satisfaction with the services, inter-personal interaction was cited as an area for improvement. On-site training of service providers will be necessary in the upcoming year.   

The measles campaign was leveraged to deliver services for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition in the regions, contributing to improved coverage. This experience underscores the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated services. However, the nutrition sector cannot rely exclusively on the health system to prevent malnutrition. Since March, UNICEF has been collaborating with Addis Ababa University and the private sector to locally produce affordable egg powder in Ethiopia to improve children's diets.
  
Every Child Learns 
UNICEF’s continued engagement in the Ethiopia General Education Quality Improvement Programme for Equity (GEQIP-E) created ample opportunities to influence sector prioritization and agenda setting focused on the promotion of inclusive and equitable access to quality education for all. The mid-term review of GEQIP-E shows that it is effective in addressing the deteriorating quality of education, promoting equity including advancing girls’ education and education for children with disabilities, and systematically strengthening the education system for planning, policy formulation and reform. Since Ethiopia was heavily impacted by multiple emergencies such as droughts, floods, conflicts, and refugee influxes throughout 2020, UNICEF’s continued partnerships with key education stakeholders such as NGOs, UNESCO IIEP, UNHCR and bi-lateral and multi-lateral donors was critical in sustaining the provision of quality education for vulnerable children affected by humanitarian crises. Some innovative models of accelerated learning such as the speed school programme demonstrated an effective, durable strategy to decrease and eventually eliminate the prevalence of out-of-school primary aged children in the country.

Every Child is Protected from Violence and Exploitation
COVID-19 provided an opportunity to ‘test’ the capacity of the child protection system to respond in the middle of such a crisis. A key lesson was the need to change the approach to training of the social service workforce to ensure their engagement in the COVID-19 response. Case management training materials were adjusted and taught remotely. UNICEF then partnered with VIAMO, a technology-based company, to undertake the remote training of 975 social workers through SMS and mobile phones.   
     
The return of Ethiopian migrants and laborers from various countries, among whom were many under-18 year olds, required the presence of social workers to manage the cases coming back. UNICEF Ethiopia used this opportunity to advocate very closely with the government on the importance of establishing a social work force able to work across all contexts (both humanitarian and development). The result was a stronger commitment by highest levels of government to this work; UNICEF was able therefore to use a crisis as an opportunity for building better services for children.  
 
Every Child has an Equitable Chance in Life
The adaptation of UPSNP to provide additional cash top-ups to the most vulnerable beneficiaries demonstrated the importance of leveraging the social protection system to respond to COVID-19. Using existing government systems, especially social workers for outreach, was instrumental for supporting those most in need. According to UNICEF’s recent post distribution survey, 95 per cent of beneficiaries received information on the top-ups, 77 per cent of these from social workers directly. Nearly all beneficiaries (97 per cent) said the cash top-ups were vital for enabling them to buy food to cover the needs of their family members. Furthermore, 90 per cent received guidance form social workers on how to protect themselves from COVID-19, 84 per cent were supported by social workers to collect their cash transfers, and over half to access healthcare services. These findings reinforce the vital role existing social protection systems and social workers play in times of shock.    
   
Prioritizing Innovation - In December 2020, UNICEF signed an agreement (LOU) with the Ethiopian Ministry of Peace and the African Drone and Data Academy to explore initiatives regarding the application of frontier technology such as drones to further benefit the development of children and youth in Ethiopia. This initiative along with end user monitoring for nutrition, egg powder for dietary diversification and 3D printing have been put forth as priority innovations to explore in the 2020-2025 country programme.
"
ESAR,Kenya,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"A key lesson learned in 2020 was that during an unprecedented crisis the office can manage a milestone process through re-thinking and adjusting standard approaches.  Instead of the planned mid-term review the country office undertook a “mid-point strategic reflection.” This was informed by an assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on children, a deeper study on devolution and children, and a gender programme review. Key strategy shifts for prioritization were identified and comprised of intensified work at county level, more integrated programming, stronger role in influencing, a greater focus on resilience and inclusion of gender transformative approaches. These shifts will be prioritized for the rest of the country programme. 
 
The use of a “whole-of-office” approach for responding to the COVID-19, and for continuity of learning for children, was critical for delivering results. The team managed to influence the debate on the re-opening schools and facilitated school preparedness. UNICEF used global scientific evidence on COVID-19, lessons learned from other countries, and implemented a mixed range of advocacy approaches to build support for safe schools reopening. 
 
The importance of investing in data and evidence generation, together with other UN agencies, and partnering with renowned national institutions to influence planning processes for children and women, was a key lesson. The county budget briefs and county poverty profiles published by the Kenya Institute for Public Policy and Research Analysis serve as reference documents for planning, budget allocation and prioritization. They also act as the basis for discussions on county integrated and development plans (CIDP). 
 
In 2020 UNICEF supported the GenU Kenya Country Investment Agenda (CIA) that identified scalable initiatives to address skills gap and earning opportunities for young people. The analysis informed  the main workstreams of the 2020 – 2021 Action Plan which focus on connectivity, scaling up online learning and skilling, supporting young people as change makers, removing barriers to accessing education, training and employment and COVID-19 response and mitigation. 

UNICEF remains committed to innovating to improve programmes and services for children. In 2020, the country office leveraged innovative technologies to ensure that programmes and services targeting children were not interrupted by the restrictions related to COVID-19. The fact that Kenya had already made investments in remote learning layed the groundwork for quick expansion by the Ministry of Education using the internet, radio and TV stations. However, greater investment in digitalization across sectors is required. UNICEF actively participated in rolling out the global Reimagine Education initiative in Kenya. In partnership with the government, UNICEF identified 1,160 schools which will be connected to the internet and reach 348,000 learners. The first 10 schools were connected through a shared-value partnership with Nokia and mobile network operators Safaricom and Airtel. Being able to jumpstart school connectivity work through reprogrammed funds was vital to attract other partners. The scale-up of connectivity to all public primary schools, which is a priority of the Kenya National Broadband Strategy, is being led by the government. Through showcasing what can be done quickly, UNICEF has earned credibility in this space and is engaging with development partners including the EU, International Financial Institutions(IFIs) and private sector partners to expand the work.
 
In addition to school connectivity, companies and other partners have supported behaviour change communication, both around risk reduction and school return. For example, Safaricom worked with UNICEF to improve the national COVID-19 helpline. As UNICEF expands its work with the private sector in particular, senior management oversight and guidance, and support from regional and global levels, will continue to be key to successfully leveraging growing opportunities. 

COVID-19 led to the postponement of the in-person GenU Youth challenge planned at the beginning of 2020. UNICEF adapted and facilitated a completely virtual youth challenge identifying transformative ideas from young people. The virtual approach has been useful to respond to COVID-19 and will continue to be used as a sustainable way to scale engagement with youth representatives. One of the Kenyan teams from an informal settlement called the Green Project Initiative among the 2020 Global GenU youth challenge competition winners. Working on the challenge highlighted the need for more individualized mentorship for young people, as well as the need to provide young people with access to broader innovation ecosystem. Efforts are underway to set up partnerships with incubators and innovation hubs. 
 
More than 890 young Kenyans have been engaged in user testing and developing of a youth-centric and digital-enabled youth marketplace (YOMA) which is linked to national youth empowerment platforms. This initiative is being tested under the umbrella of  GenU Kenya.
 
To improve child, newborn, and maternal health, UNICEF, the MoH and the Philips Foundation implemented a digitalized health equipment monitoring system in 40 health facilities in Kakamega and Kisumu counties. The pilot project is expected to provide evidence regarding the benefit of regular maintenance and repair of medical equipment and its positive impact on improved health services for children and women in Kenya. 
 
UNICEF and Kenya Red Cross Society worked with various government ministries, the MoH, Ministry of Labor and Social Protection, and National Drought Management Authority to use RapidPro for digital community messaging, surveillance, and feedback mechanisms. The platform was used to send nutrition messages in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, collect data on the locust plague, send warnings of approaching swarms to communities, and provide education on cash transfer programmes. More than 300,000 messages have been sent out to health workers and the community. 
 
UNICEF adopted various innovative ways to cope with COVID-19 situation at the operational level. Remote supply end monitoring was developed to adapt to the travel restrictions and ensure supplies reached intended beneficiaries. M-Pesa payments and transactions were instituted for some payments with partners. Other adjustments included paperless signatures and document approvals which have now been permanently adopted by the country office to reduce printing costs and bring about process efficiencies. Innovative ways to organize all staff meetings to foster stronger team spirit in the virtual workspace included children's involvement and periodic interaction on various subjects, including their experience of living in the world affected by COVID-19. 
"
ESAR,Lesotho,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Despite the difficult programming environment due to COVID-19, UNICEF was able to adapt swiftly to respond to emerging issues while keeping Government priorities in sight. Leveraging existing partnerships with CSOs in the field in order to reach communities, using Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and adapting how we work helped us reach children, adolescents and families. Health workers were supported with airtime and data packages for key virtual meetings ensuring programme continuity during the COVID-19 lockdown.

Distance learning through radio and television became key platforms for (pre)schoolers, and online teaching and learning was also utilized by the LCE for its student teachers, thereby avoiding a backlog of students repeating a year. UNICEF's work on strengthening national coordination on education in emergencies was crucial to the effective development of an education sector response plan on COVID-19. Partnerships to address remote teaching and learning challenges and to develop offline learning opportunities need to be strengthened. Other platforms such as Facebook and radio were used to encourage mothers and caregivers on health services utilization. 

UNICEF deployed U-Report in August 2020 to improve the effectiveness of programmes and ensure adolescents’ engagement. Additionally, U-Report was launched as reports of declining access to adolescent-friendly health services were reported among AYP, including AGYW. Through UNICEF U-Report has been used to enable young people and marginalized groups to have access to information and a voice on issues that matter to them. In 2020, U-Report proved useful in amplifying the barriers towards access to health and education of AYP to high-level discussions for rapid decision making.  UNICEF Lesotho will continue to support the Government of Lesotho in 2020 to generate evidence and strengthen innovative SRHR/HIV programming.

The MoET struggled to effectively implement COVID-19 response plans due to a lack of technical capacity and effective coordination structures. This was compounded by political changes in the country at the start of the crisis which led to the appointment of a new Minister and senior management staff. To mitigate some of these challenges, UNICEF worked closely with other development partners to advocate for the safe reopening of schools providing technical support and resources. UNICEF engaged likeminded partners such as the World Bank, in order to strengthen our advocacy messages and support. Engaging the Resident Coordinator to advocate with the Prime Minister at a critical juncture was key in pushing for a national decision to reopen schools. Though UNICEF is the “go-to” partner in the Education sector, working in partnership with key partners was an important lesson. 
COVID-19 crisis provided an opportunity to strengthen the social protection system and its shock-responsiveness by increasing coverage of beneficiaries in the mainstream programmes. It was unexpected, but the crisis presented an opportunity which UNICEF seized. UNICEF’s years of support and close relationship with MoSD, allowed for us to respond to their evolving needs and concerns. The involvement of key Government stakeholders reflects in the strategic documents to enhance integrated social safety nets and improve shock-responsive social protection, as they reflect the currently existing challenges and address actual needs.

While supporting efforts to improve Public Finance for Children, we learned that it is important to hold consultations for the next fiscal year budget well in advance so that citizen-views can be meaningfully reflected in the budget documents As well, holding regular (remote) meetings to discuss and solve issues regarding the annual work plan has been very instrumental in assuring implementation of activities.

The M&E SitAn provided insight on the Lesotho Statistical System and we learned that this needs to be modernized by digitalizing its process and methods.

In terms of being able to stay and deliver as a team and CO, a number of lessons were learned: adopting and supporting, including financially, virtual tools was key to programme implementation. Using a range of methods -- email, phone calls, text messaging, WhatsApp platforms, mail polls, virtual meetings, and electronic approval systems – all contributed to our programme continuity, quality assurance, enhanced coordination and monitoring of programmes. The CO successfully migrated to the Cloud for all infrastructure and used an always-on VPN, which enhanced faster access to Vision and UNICEF apps for Lesotho staff.
 
Good practices include the adoption of grant opening meeting (GOM) for all new and additional resources. The COVID-19 emergency has changed patterns of living and working, which led to a total re-evaluation of work, including M&E, as we know it. As a result, the emergence of a “new normal” of remote working, remote monitoring, and remote guidance and tools came to life. Also, WhatsApp, phone calls, and video-conferencing became important tools to use when conducting remote assessments and surveys. Digital platforms also played an important role in engaging different stakeholders. Investment and advocacy for participatory research for evidence. informed C4D responses led to strengthened RCCE teams, who have also trained on Participatory Rural Appraisal tools. 
 
Providing flexibility to staff, prioritizing duty of care of team members and providing platforms to share and learn and support each other helped strengthen the team spirit of the CO and helped diminish stress, anxiety and contributed to staff well-being.

ESAR,Madagascar,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons learned

The challenges and costs of operating in Madagascar are frequently underestimated and need to be more clearly documented and explained in our new country programme. Multiple and evolving government priorities, the absence of official development plans, frequent turnover in ministries, statutory changes, low technical capacity (especially  budgeting and financial management) and the temptation towards short-term political action rather than long-term solutions hamper delivery of programmes already limited by poor infrastructure and insecurity. To continue working with Government and decentralized authorities and avoid alternatives (such as substituting government with NGOs or the private sector), UNICEF needs to be more transparent with its donors about the financial and human cost of doing so effectively. 
UNICEF has played a growing role in Madagascar in the area of public financial management, but its comparative advantage needs to be further refined and defined. UNICEF cannot do everything in this vast and technical sector, but it can take on certain responsibilities and improve the results. Advocacy on and analysis of the Finance Law needs to start earlier and include greater involvement by programme sectors. UNICEF needs to bring to bear the comparative advantage of its field presence and proximity to decentralized entities, such as regional social services directorates, to understand and highlight the challenges that on-the-ground service providers face with regard to the allocation and spending of domestic funds. In the challenging and sensitive technical area of fiscal and political decentralization, UNICEF could potentially play a far stronger role (as described in the strategy notes for the new country programme 2021¿2023). 
UNICEF was certainly not the only organization to learn lessons about organizational efficiency and effectiveness during the pandemic. Connectivity and digitalization offer both opportunities and constraints in Madagascar. With technical support from UNICEF most coordination groups, including at Prime Minister level, were able to set up regular virtual exchanges, enabling greater participation by partners and field colleagues. Programme monitoring went virtual, with some success. The UNSCDF consultations, facilitated by UNICEF’s IT capacity, brought together 700 participants over Zoom. UNICEF organized online training when face-to-face was impossible and was able to increase the number of participants in such activities. Mobilization and monitoring of social media, including via support of youth activists, was vital during the COVID-19 response. A virtual donor visit was prepared by UNICEF and shared with all donors, allowing them to see the projects they support. Although working virtually was beneficial for some, it remains problematic for most: only 11 per cent of the population has internet access. As a result, upstream efforts to promote distance learning, medical teleconsultations, tablet-based monitoring systems and even interactive knowledge management tools do not offer sustainable solutions for most Malagasy at the current time.  
A major lesson learned was the necessity of improving the quality, frequency and reciprocity of UNICEF’s community-level interventions. Getting feedback on progress and suggestions for improvement from communities remained a challenge, despite isolated initiatives (community health policy, hotlines for child protection and C4D, committees for some cash transfer approaches and stronger involvement of local leaders in social mobilization). The centralization of resources in the capital and a lack of financial incentives at decentralized levels have discouraged communities. UNICEF’s new country programme calls for reinforced community components and introduces innovations such as positive masculinity workshops to fight child marriage. Experimenting with approaches along various community typologies (extremely vulnerable rural, better-off peri-urban etc.) will help UNICEF understand communities better and achieve better results. 

Innovations

UNICEF’s health team innovated by making oxygenotherapy available at scale for COVID-19 patients (becoming Madagascar’s main supplier) and encouraging low-tech innovations, such as kangaroo approaches, for premature babies. The cold chain, at local level and through central refurbishment, will progressively become more solar-reliant. 
To promote WASH, UNICEF engaged in partnerships with the private sector, developing locally made and low-cost contactless handwashing stations that were distributed to institutions. Ten solar-powered electro-chlorinators were installed in the south, generating more than 3,000 litres of chlorine. The groundwater early warning system established two years ago in eight vulnerable districts in the south of Madagascar remains a flagship for UNICEF’s leadership in the sector. During COVID-19, UNICEF launched the ‘Save a Life’ campaign, subsidizing the price of water and thus rapidly increasing access in the most affected cities, paving the way for at-scale urban solutions. UNICEF’s focus on menstrual health and hygiene brought to scale a more comprehensive approach targeting girls, boys, women, and men to reinforce messages and reduce stigma. Local production of 12,000 low-cost sanitation product solutions will be used as seed capital to engage sanitation entrepreneurs. 
Environment is another sector where UNICEF has shown leadership and innovation. UNICEF installed seven pollution captors in Antananarivo that collect daily data published in a weekly bulletin, to raise awareness and foster partnerships such as the one between the ministries of education and environment, facilitated by UNICEF.
A seven-week online training on ‘business for results’ was co-created and co-led with ESARO, allowing UNICEF Madagascar staff to enrich their knowledge about working with the private sector. The training included contributions by UNICEF’s Regional Office and Headquarters and other country offices. Special guests from Madagascar’s private sector also participated. One concrete result of the training was the development of a plan for engaging with the private sector in the new country programme. 
"
ESAR,Malawi,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In 2020 Malawi CO operation faced an unprecedented response to a global pandemic that had to be delivered in a country context with high prevalence of poverty and limited fiscal base hampering the Government’s efforts to both respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and maintain essential social services. Programme implementation was further impacted by the need to deliver on programme priorities through remote implementation and within a severely disrupted global supply chain. The country was clearly not prepared for such global impact. There were no immediate relevant policy, guidance and procedures established, nor adequate stocks of supplies for prevention and response in health or to allow remote education. Travel restrictions made collection of data and assessment of needs difficult, thus hampering accurate programme estimations. Previously weak systems, such as for example supply tracking systems, hampered the accurate estimation of needs. Experience in contact tracing was limited. The disruption of the global supply chain delayed the delivery of critical health supplies, including PPE. The initial coordination of the response was challenging and emergency financing was not immediately available constrained by domestic pressures requiring internal investments in donor countries. The global freeze on recruitment and air space lockdown affected recruitment options and speed.
 
To sustain government action ensuring continuity of services and avoid risks of substantial diversion of government investment and foreign aid towards the COVID-19 response, UNICEF Malawi intensified its evidence-based advocacy and strengthened data collection by deploying remote methods. All COVID-19 response programmes were designed as multi-sectoral interventions and negotiated with donors in an integrated manner bringing higher impact to UNICEF Malawi response. Cross-border discussions were initiated to identify local or neighbouring country procurement solutions. 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic created opportunities to boost innovations supported by private sector investments. The first African Drone and Data Academy (ADDA) established in January 2020 provided online training to 145 graduates of which 60 per cent women. Opportunities to use drone operations for delivering test samples were used to quickly decongest border reception centres, especially during the massive influx of returned in April - May 2020. A COVID-19 quarantine management system (mQuarantine) allowed the MoHP to interact with patients in self-isolation and quarantine and track in real-time their conditions, and a COVID-19 data modelling platform offered MoHP real-time predictive analytics for national and district level projections. A SCTP e-payment system was introduced as well. Some 6,248 young people participated in the COVID-19 Youth Challenge with 16 young entrepreneur’s ideas receiving grants (https://www.unicef.org/malawi/covid-19-youth-challenge-winners). A total of 223,000 young people were regularly consulted through U-Report on issues related to the impact of the COVID-19 on their lives, thus supporting better tailoring of UNICEF Malawi emergency response. Alternative data collection methods were deployed, including through mobile data collection, use of Google sheets and Rapid Pro. A Field Monitoring Dashboard was established providing real time information to both UNICEF Malawi and government partners, including in districts, and supporting flexible programme adjustments
https://malawi.4p2c.org/portal/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/0293ddab173740ebb43ba2e6322194d0 .

The pandemic response proved once again the strong reputation of UNICEF in Malawi. The CO was an immediate partner of choice for key social sector ministries and major development donors due to its reliability, dual mandate in development and humanitarian field and ability to provide strong technical expertise across social sectors, as well as its unique procurement capacity. UNICEF Malawi’s convening power was recognised and was effective in mobilising all social sector clusters for rapid preparedness and response, while engaging partners around critical issues such as national financing, continuity of services and bringing attention to underfunded areas and gaps. 
 
Key lessons learned underlined the need to invest more in local level partnerships, including with local authorities, CSOs and traditional leaders to ensure efficient, effective and rapid outreach to communities. The impact of cash transfer politics was clearly seen during the year underlining the importance of establishing a predictable, shock responsive and government owned (and financed) SCTP with clear objectives and supported by a robust One UN vision combining both emergency and development considerations. In line with the global supply challenges, it is critical to expand private sector partnerships and support local businesses for quality local production. The criticality of risk communication cannot be overstated and C4D and risk communication should be robustly built in any future programme. The criticality of investing in staff wellbeing and support is imperative. Equally important is to boost investment in Mental Health and Psychosocial Support programmes for communities and children. 
 
Lessons learned from the first year of programme implementation within a global pandemic context opens new opportunities to strengthen engagement of the CO in 2021. The use of evidence-based advocacy to advance the cause of children will continue to be emphasised and stronger engagement in public financing for children will focus on improving government counterparts’ capacities in PFM. Enhanced investments in systematic professional development of the social sectors workforce will continue to be critical for delivery of quality services for children. Building on the strong political priority the Youth agenda holds within the newly elected government, harnessing the power of youth and youth’s stronger engagement in community life will be critical to achieve transformative changes addressing issues with access and quality of services and curbing negative social norms.   
 
UNICEF Malawi will continue to explore opportunities for stronger UN joint action bringing greater impact in upholding children’s rights in Malawi, while also further enhancing its strong leadership role within the UN in advancing Social Sector reforms. The CO will intensify pro-active resource mobilisation and will engage in regular dialogue with donors to maintain awareness on child rights and needs. Opportunities for innovative financing will be explored with UNICEF’s National Committees and headquarters.  Innovations will be further boosted and investment in agile operational system will continue, including in human resource management, diversification of supply channels and stronger engagement with private sector. UNICEF Malawi will continue in 2021 to have a strong presence in Malawi delivering on the needs of all children and further reaching out to the most vulnerable.
"
ESAR,Namibia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Maximizing on the partnership with Friends of Namibia’s Children (FNC), a group consisting of Executive Directors from line Ministries working on children’s issues, UNICEF shapes informed decision making within key nodal government structures. The value-add of FNC is exemplified in positioning children’s issue in the national agenda as the recent case of support to the development of HPP II. UNICEF convened bi-annual meetings with the group to prioritize key issues as the CO reprogrammed during COVID-19.  
 
Another key lesson learnt is that policy and strategy development need to be accompanied by a realistic and well costed implementation plan. This ensures that the activities and strategies contained in the national plan are budgeted for and implemented. For instance, the Social Protection Policy was partly delayed due to ambitious strategies that were not fiscally sustainable, particularly given the constrained fiscal situation worsened by COVID-19. To ensure fiscal affordability and sustainability, UNICEF’s proposal for the GRN to adopt a gradual universalism approach to the implementation of the universal child grants, was adopted in the draft Policy. 
 
An important lesson of the value add in costing was learned. To address a fiscal challenge in ECD, a systematic, multi-year approach has been adopted. Following an ECD cost of inaction study led by Interteam in 2019, UNICEF co-led the systematic review and costing of the integrated ECD framework. UNICEF supported capacity building of the implementing Ministries in the use of the costing tool and facilitated translation of the costing tool to inform annual budget preparation for the key Ministries. This ensured that for the first time, the 2021/22 and 2022/23 ECD national budget bids will be directly informed by the costed framework, with the tool enabling informed revisions aligned to budget ceilings. UNICEF’s pioneering partnership model with the EU and Interteam, contributed to stronger national systems, innovative financing mechanisms, and enabling environment for integrated ECD. Further support was provided to ECD in the design of a Government-led pilot of a localized results-based financing (RBF) framework. Funded by the Botnar Foundation through Interteam’s implementation, the RBF pilot will test the use of public and private sector entities as outcome payers to ‘buy’ results when they have been achieved, while capacitating Government to take over the RBF model of funding through a phased approach. An important gap in the delivery of quality ECD services relates to the capacity of the ECD workforce at sub-national and grassroots level, where the current training model of cascading skills using ToT has yielded little results due to sub-national capacity and follow-up inadequacies. 
 
UNICEF Namibia optimized the use of virtual tools during the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce the CO’s carbon footprint thanks to less travel by having meetings via Zoom and Skype for Business, risk of infections and expenses. In 2020, the CO laid the foundation to mainstream virtual modus operandi both internally and in its engagements with Government and partners: the Violence Against Children Study (VACS) the validation of which spanned two months at the height of lockdown and included all key line Ministries; capacity building for Namibia Statistics Agency and NPC in multidimensional poverty analysis and measurement; ESARO Education and ECD network meetings, etc. Additional technical support was offered remotely by Oxford University, culminating in the development of a National multidimensional poverty report for Namibia. 
 
COVID-19 laid bare the service delivery vulnerabilities related to inadequate ICT infrastructure and capacity. Some planned interventions, especially in capacity building and community engagement, were adversely affected by restrictions on gatherings and travel, and many had to be conducted online with varying degrees of success across sectors. Adaptation of trainings to online accelerated implementation of skills building for MNH QoC and eMTCT, while bringing to a halt skill-building of Community Liaison Officers for ECD and adversely affecting support supervision and monitoring for most primary health care interventions due to ICT capacity challenges. To mitigate this challenge, UNICEF supported the Primary Health Care Directorate with computers and remote internet connectivity. Similarly, continued education through digital learning had severe limitations, as only 13,000 out of the 804,079 learners were connected to the internet. Thus, UNICEF supported the Ministry of Education with the development of paper-based workbooks to reduce the impact of school closures on most learners. Furthermore, the importance of investing in preparedness and collective action for emergencies, was also highlighted as key lessons learnt when moving forward our partnership with the Private Sector. For accelerated action on sanitation, where Government political commitment has not yet been matched with adequate resources and the current focus on a toilet-building approach has delivered little results, UNICEF has actively advocated for inclusion of community-participatory approaches to sanitation as an alternative strategic approach in the new national Harambee Prosperity Plan. UNICEF used its convening power to facilitate exchange of ideas and collaborative support from civil society and the private sector in improving access to sanitation, especially in urban informal settlements, which will continue to be an area of strong focus in 2021.
 
Despite previous investment in orientation of MoHSS and central medical store on procurement and cold chain management, health sector procurement continues to face efficiency and timeliness challenges, including bottlenecks related to processes and the enabling environment required for the unique and high value nature of procurement. To complement on-going support directly provided to the Health Sector by other development partners, UNICEF assisted the Ministry of Finance for convening health sector partners to agree solutions through complementary efficiency analysis.
 
Overall, this exceptionally challenging year demonstrated what approach to development policy and practice is most effective in Namibia’s UMIC context. UNICEF has been sharply focused on the combination of realizing child-rights, providing timely technical support to Government and civil society partners alike, building value adding partnerships with private sector, and tying these elements into a coherent, well-planned and evidence-informed support to Namibia to realize its own development priorities.

"
ESAR,Republic of Mozambique,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Adaptability and quick response to a changing environment: The pandemic emphasized the importance of adopting new and flexible approaches to deliver timely and efficient results for women and children. In response to social-distancing restrictions, UNICEF supported the Government at national and subnational levels by facilitating access to and the use of new technologies for communicating, collecting data, training and capacity development, while providing PPE to support the continuation of key essential in-person services. The use of technology was applied in new ways. For instance, platforms like mobile cash were introduced to promote digital solutions to cash management as a mitigation measure to the secondary impacts of COVID-19. UNICEF supported mentorship of health workers on newborn care and inpatient nutritional care of children through online group exchanges and platforms and as a result, frontline workers were reached at one-fifth of the original approach costs. 

UNICEF reacted quickly for effective programming during the pandemic. Education through distance learning support was provided to 923,000 children nationwide via radio and television programs during the school closures. In child protection, social workers were trained to work on-line to provide PSS and triage cases to determine the most severe ones necessary for in-person visits. Seminars with Members of Parliament took the form of webinars to discuss the socio-impact of COVID-19 on children as well as the state budget proposal. Mastering Data for Children training was conducted in an online format, and as a result of its success, the module and lessons learned were requested by other UNICEF country offices for replication. 

Consolidating trusted relationships with donors and implementing partners: Mozambique has been subject to a volatile environment due to past and current emergencies. It has been simultaneously recovering from two cyclones and responding to a growing conflict in Cabo Delgado as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. In this context, timeline revisions and work plan adjustments were critical to quickly mobilize, adapt and consolidate existing partnerships to deliver results. UNICEF’s sound relationship with donors allowed for multiple grants to be reprogrammed for the evolving priorities. A best practice example is the emergency clause in an EU agreement of €500,000 to kick-start an emergency response and a contingency fund of €1 million in the same grant. The latter was used to mobilize US$3 million to support the COVID-19 response in a one-month timeframe.

UNICEF played a fundamental role as member of the core COVID-19 coordination group and was one of five partners selected to support the MoH in addressing the pandemic. UNICEF also co-led working groups in communication, community response, procurement and supplies, education, SP and WASH IPC. In addition, UNICEF continued to serve as cluster lead for education, nutrition and WASH sectors, coordinating the response to the multiple emergencies as well as the cyclone recovery efforts.

These central coordination roles strengthened UNICEF’s ability to advocate with key partners, support effective sector coordination, and leverage resources. Collaboration with UN agencies and the scale-up of partnerships with International Financial Institutions such as the WB, Islamic Development Bank, ADB and IMF, as well as civil society organizations, have been vital in Mozambique’s complex emergency context. Public-private partnerships and multi-stakeholder initiatives will continue to be essential in 2021 to expand reach and results for children.
Producing evidence is a top priority: The results and efforts of 2020 are characterized by adaptation, technological innovation and planning under high levels of uncertainty. COVID-19 brought new opportunities for data use and analyses. Initiatives to produce evidence in such a context included supporting a real time monitoring platform for the COVID-19 response by the MoE.  A ‘Rapid Learn’ telephone survey was developed to collect information from key stakeholders addressing the short-term effects of the pandemic on child learning and family welfare and data from this tool later informed policy debate on school reopening.  

Additionally, two national KAP surveys on COVID-19 preventive practices were conducted. 
UNICEF and WFP provided technical support to the Secretariat for Food and Nutrition Security to identify a new method of obtaining food security and nutrition information called the mobile Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping (m-VAM). The m-VAM is a mobile phone-based tool which was used to conduct a nationwide food security survey to collect data used for IPC acute food insecurity analysis. Furthermore, a health management information system (DHIS2) dashboard on continuity of essential services was developed and analysis of data on the impact of disruptions in essential services on maternal and child mortality was conducted using the Lives Saved Tool. 

UNICEF supported two research initiatives on violence and access to justice that included an administrative data review and a situation analysis. UNICEF also worked in close collaboration with GIZ to introduce and support the conception of an education management information system (EMIS) module, contributing to system strengthening at decentralized levels.  In strengthening national capacity in evidence-based policy and programs, UNICEF guided the creation of the first National Association of Monitoring and Evaluation (AMMA), which was registered in 2020.  And finally, UNICEF led an impact evaluation of the Accelerated School Readiness (ASR) Programme which was selected as a finalist in the Best of UNICEF Research and Evaluation (BOURE) 2020.

The launch and continuous development of evidence-based advocacy tools were instrumental in bringing children’s issues into the policy spotlight.  UNICEF developed a policy note to facilitate discussion with MPs at the early stage of the pandemic to generate awareness of the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 on children.  Subsequently, a second policy note was produced focusing on policy recommendations as well as notes on thematic topics which stimulated productive discussions with donors, Government and a wider group of partners.  

"
ESAR,Rwanda,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF’s comparative advantage as a convener and provider of technical support has been the key driving factor of the education programme’s achievements. As co-chair of the education sector, UNICEF has been able to utilize its platform to inform critical decisions, policy advocacy, and education programme development. UNICEF led the sector to respond to the school closure, ensuring continuity of remote learning through radio and television lessons and coordinating efforts for COVID-19 response, in general, and school reopening, specifically. Moreover, through coordinated efforts, the Government of Rwanda has been able to leverage funding for COVID-19 education response through the GPE Accelerated Funds for which UNICEF is the Coordinating Agent. 

Children with disabilities continued to benefit from learning opportunities during COVID-19.  Progress was made in the regular programme with the increased parental demand for support for children with disabilities for remote learning opportunities.  Both national and community-level interventions were needed to ensure that children with disabilities were provided learning opportunities, which included the inclusion of sign language interpretation of television lessons, to the provision of airtime for local education stakeholders to be able to reach households and provide remote support via telephone. 

Building on lessons learned from previous years, technology was embedded into remedial learning content to ensure positive effects on learning.  In fact, the consultation process with stakeholders which guided the revision of the curriculum used for remedial classes has enhanced the relevance of learning and the participation of low performing girls and boys.    

Child protection must be an essential service in all emergencies, including health pandemics. The exclusion of child protection as an essential service was initially observed during the EVD preparedness phase but confirmed during COVID-19 response. In both cases the health sector took the lead and the national response strategies did not include child protection even though children continued to experience violence, abuse and exploitation. During COVID-19 UNICEF advocated for inclusion of child protection as an essential service and is developing guidance specifically on child protection in health emergencies.  

A strong child protection system and case management is critical to protect children during unexpected events. This year, the numbers of child protection cases being referred to the National Child Development Agency rose, due in part to the growing recognition and capacity of the institution, however, the institution struggled to handle the cases as there was no clear case management system. UNICEF began to support the development of such a system in 2020. 

The equity agenda in ECD improved social, physical and psychological well-being of children of incarcerated women.  UNICEF, in partnership with UMUHUZA, supported NCDA and Rwanda Correction Services (RCS) to provide ECD services to children of incarcerated mothers, including those who are either pregnant or breastfeeding. The children leave the prisons at the age of 3 years to stay with foster parents or other family members. Before that, the children lacked a stimulating environment and facilities to advance their growth and development. In response, UNICEF supported the construction and operationalisation of an ECD centre in Musanze prison as well as the training of 15 Prison Wardens (8 Females; 7 Males) as ECD trainers/facilitators. A total of 73 parents in Musanze and four other prisons were also trained as ECD trainers/facilitators. This will provide a safe, secure and stimulating environment which is ideal for optimal growth and development to 441 children (224 girls; 217 boys) in the prisons. Interaction with other children through play has enriched their social, physical and psychological well-being. 

Ebola Virus Disease preparedness was key to the successful response to COVID-19 response in Rwanda.  Rwanda responded quickly and effectively to COVID-19, with continuing minimal community transmission due to quickly putting in place effective preventive measures and drawing on the extensive capacity building, established guidance and pre-positioned supplies delivered during the period of EVD preparedness.  UNICEF’s support for new outbreaks such as COVID-19 will remain vital to consolidate Government’s capacity to prepare and respond to public health emergencies that threaten decades of development gains across society. 

Companies are very effective in convincing other companies to support child-friendly spaces. By facilitating peer-to-peer learning visits between stakeholders in the tea industry and other sectors, UNICEF identified champions who shared their experience and encouraged action from companies in the mining, rice and textile companies to invest in child friendly spaces. This emerged as a powerful advocacy tool in engaging other industries. 

While the COVID-19 pandemic posed challenges, it also created new opportunities to engage with adolescents.  UNICEF utilized social media and TV/Radio, including the adolescent-led Itetero TV/Radio series, to disseminate key messages to children and adolescents. UNICEF promoted remote learning for adolescents using the ICT platform and utilized multi-media channels to disseminate key information to adolescents. UNICEF closely worked with the MINEDUC to develop ICT platforms for remedial education, and it helped adolescents to continue learning during the COVID-19 school closure. Digital content for remedial education reached 8,900 adolescents (7,200 female) in school and 1,000 adolescent girls in youth centres.  

Rwanda’s strong internet providers enabled UNICEF to operate remotely during COVID movement restrictions and to implement time-saving digital techniques.  UNICEF now utilizes electronic fund transfers, reducing transaction time from a full day to about one hour and eliminating the need to take paper requests to the bank.  All staff have been connected to the internet and almost all transactions can be done online.  While these methods do not substitute for crucial human interaction, they enable business continuity during lockdowns and movement restrictions.

"
ESAR,Somalia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Goal Area 1: UNICEF Health prioritised existing humanitarian and  development implementing partners and programmes for supplementary COVID-19  humanitarian programme documents. And this, together with the flexibility of  donors and partners, allowed for a much-needed timely response. Essential  medicines and vaccines for 134 health facilities were prepositioned at the  start of the pandemic to pre-empt stock-outs due to supply chain disruptions.    
   
UNICEF Nutrition acted fast to mitigate the impact  of COVID-19 on service delivery via adapting the use of virtual platforms for  meetings, which enabled the completion of nutrition policy work. It also  developed a programme document (PD) supply-monitoring matrix for all  nutrition supplies. This tracks the original PD supply allocations versus  actual releases to partners and updates them in real-time. This has fostered  better accountability, ease of reporting, and, in 2020, reduced supply releases  by 30% (compared to 2019), despite similar caseloads of SAM children reached.  
   
In the context of COVID-19, virtual trainings and  meetings have proven to be efficient and led to cost savings. Blended online  trainings, combined with roving trainers, proved particularly effective. UNICEF  Health also conducted weekly, online meetings with its partners, to mitigate  reduced monitoring and supervision activities, plus the inability to  physically visit programme sites.   
   
Nutrition programmes also held online trainings to  reach 100% of frontline nutrition workers and partners. In addition, the  introduction of RapidPro, a mobile-based data-collection platform, allowed  continued, virtual coordination and planning with partners.  
   
While face-to-face trainings and meetings offer more  interaction, UNICEF will aim to look at a combination of virtual and  in-person training modalities for cost savings in the future.     
   
The mid-term review of the Joint Resilience  Programme, in Gedo and Banadir, highlighted results including: a reduction of  child wasting, an increased uptake of nutrition services and better  integration of SAM and MAM prevention and treatment. Additionally, the  integration of health and nutrition programming increased cost efficiency. However,  it also prolonged the already lengthy PD process and therefore the turnaround  time for the development of PDs needs to be managed.   
   
Goal Area 2: A key lesson  learned following the development of remote learning is that the online  learning platforms were not accessible by most children, particularly the most vulnerable children, i.e.,  those from pastoralist, rural, IDP, and urban-poor communities, as internet  utilisation remains low: 11% across the country. This has created a ‘digital  divide’; increasing inequity amongst the most marginalised children.  
   
A critical, common challenge across Somalia is the  measurement of student-learning outcomes, as there is duplication and an  absence of standardised tools. The plan is to address this through advocacy  with other sector partners, to harmonise the tools and to support joint  ownership of findings from such assessments.  
   
Goal Area 3: Due to a shortage of Government social workers  during the COVID-19 crisis, UNICEF partnered with the MoWHRD and 6  universities to initiate another key, gender-sensitive  intervention, which was the training and rapid deployment of 235  student social workers, half of whom were female. They supported health  authorities in COVID-19 response and risk mitigation and provided a range of  CP services to vulnerable women and children.   
   
The uptake of policy, legislation and capacity-building  work was slowed by COVID-19. UNICEF has now hired a Government Relations Adviser  to improve its ability to engage proactively with Government and civil society,  thus ensuring that key, child rights legislation and policies are prioritised.  
   
The ONA platform/database is finally ready for  rollout and will not only improve our monitoring and reporting system, but  help make more informed decisions, i.e., it provides ‘service point’ data  which allows UNICEF to efficiently monitor the work as it happens. This will  enhance our ability to cross check and provide straightforward monitoring  data for third party monitors.    
   
Another boost for birth registration (BR) is its  integration into measles campaigns, which has continued to prove effective,  particularly in remote areas where other BR services are not yet available. However,  despite the ongoing efforts, more than 80% of children remain unregistered.  Somaliland’s merging of ID and CRVS systems, if ultimately successful, will  provide a template for advocacy and implementation at all levels across  Somalia.  
         
Goal Area 4: Acquiring WASH services and products has been  challenging due to the lack of availability, logistical issues,  transportation and abnormal prices during the pandemic. The operation and  management of UNICEF’s 9 Regional Supply Hubs, and the prepositioned stocks  at Government warehouses offered a lifeline to partners for a rapid response.    
   
Despite capacity issues, greater engagement for  direct-service provision through Government ministries and departments is  promising. Enhancing their capacity will be a priority as they offer good  opportunities for sustainability and immediate responses, when needed.   
   
The establishment of Public Private Partnership  managed water supply schemes were found to be effective for sustainable water  supply services in urban areas. Relatively affordable water tariffs need to  be expanded to new locations.   
   
Goal Area 5: UNICEF’s engagement with the Office of the Prime  Minister (OPM) was initially perceived as too political and with limited,  direct, tangible results for children. However, during COVID-19 and the start  of the NDP-9 implementation, this strategic engagement has allowed UNICEF to  take a leading facilitation position within the UN Country Team and better  influence the National Development Agenda for the benefit of Somali children.  
   
A mapping of interest and  power of different stakeholders is important, in order to have a good reading  of the internal politics within Government. In the case of the social-protection  component of the ‘Integrated Local and Economic Development Project’, funded  by the European Union, this would have allowed us to foresee resistance from  the Ministry of Planning and Economic Development, to engage better with such  a powerful player and to safeguard the considerable funding that UNICEF was  well-positioned to receive.   
   
   
These valuable lessons  learned have been taken into account in the new Country Programme and will  continue to guide us so we can further improve our work in order to achieve  greater results for Somali women and children in 2021 and beyond.

ESAR,South Africa,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF needs to further build on the useful lessons that were learned or re-confirmed: the importance of (1) being flexible in adapting to emergency contexts, (2) securing the highest political commitment; (3) aligning behind the government priorities and (4) considering government’s capacity and timelines for policy making, emergency preparedness and response.
During the emergency response for child nutrition services, a gap has emerged on the sub-optimal coordination mechanisms within state and non-state actors and the absence of clear guidance on child nutrition. As such, UNICEF South Africa will advocate for better preparedness and response on child nutrition during emergencies when engaging with state and non-state actors in 2021. Additionally, it was also identified that there exists a gap regarding the identification of active COVID-19 child cases who are at risk of malnutrition. UNICEF has since advocated for the phased-in implementation of Family MUAC to empower caregivers and mothers to screen their own children at home to ensure that malnourished children receive care and treatment timeously.

The education programme learned that, a close relationship with Government yields dividends: during the emergency, most regular programme successes were as a result of negotiation with government which, because of strong alignment and trust in UNICEF, resonated with the sector response priorities. Additionally, Covid-19 was the first national emergency in South Africa that affected all provinces and schools at the same time and there is much learning regarding emergency response particularly on the necessity and urgency of mainstreaming emergency in sector plans, with sound national coordinating mechanisms which will be emphasized in the coming year.

Although partners were quick to adjust to working through virtual platforms and worked more efficiently together, all community programmes were halted and care and referral systems for vulnerable children were compromised. However, the crisis taught the Child Protection sector to be working better together as to respond to children’s needs. The situation also led to the need to know how children are affected by the situation and as such the commitment towards using the Real Time Monitoring Tool to be used as the instrument for a real time assessment on children’s well-being came through and survey began. The first field findings from this survey which came out at the end of December 2020 and presented in the beginning of 2021 have provided statistics on child abuse, hunger and suicide intentions; this has regenerated the interest to accelerate the implementation of the cash, care and protection model with integrated social welfare workforce and digitized case and information management services which will be further prioritized in 2021. 

The ability to re-orient to an emergency mode of operation versus operating in a development context requires considerable skills and reflection. Examples include using computer-assisted telephonic interviews instead of live focus group discussions and re-orienting the content and approach of the annual budget brief series to address how each of the main social sectors responded to the pandemic. A pertinent lesson from 2020 was the need to build contingency planning into delivery modalities which will be a focus area as we progress to the following year. It can no longer be assumed that in-person presence is required to deliver on workplan commitments. What worked well was the country office’s consistency in highlighting the negative impact of accumulating spending arrears on children’s programmes, which led to the adoption of this recommendation by Parliament for a second time in three years. The sharing of information and coalition building amongst all actors in society worked well as recognizing that the situation of children was deteriorating and realizing concerted action is needed across the board and the lifecycle of children, to be managed and facilitated by an institutional child rights governance structure. UNICEF is well positioned in society in the years ahead to keep a convening role and bring all these various actors together.

The role of online and digital communication came to the fore in a year when South Africa locked down for periods of time. However, access to individuals and locations to produce engaging multimedia content was extremely challenging as the hard lockdown restricted travel. This highlighted a gap in communications relationships with organizations, families and individuals on the ground, through whom information could have been gathered even from a virtual position. Being innovative in using quotes and information sourced from a distance is an important lesson learned and to be enacted on from an emergency preparedness perspective. The communication section will seek to improve its human interest angled content in the coming months.

With a young and digitally engaged volunteer population, UNICEF was able to work with its University Clubs to quickly shift their engagement online. Having a cadre of young volunteers with the resources to be able to access digital platforms was in this instance an advantage as they spread vital COVID-19 prevention messaging quickly. Improved research and access to data during the early outbreak would have been beneficial to help tailor and inform the response. Research and data collection now form a pillar of UNICEF’s RCCE work moving forward and this will become even more critical as the COVID-19 vaccine is rolled out. The importance of nurturing relationships over time was also highlighted, as corporates stepped up to support children through UNICEF at a time of national crisis.

In 2021, UNICEF South Africa will continue to chart a path of working at national-, provincial- and local-level to address these challenges and advance the child rights and well-being in South Africa. Particularly, the year 2021 will mark the first full year of the new country programme which will continue until 2025, and will focus on (1) child health and well-being; (2) early childhood, primary and secondary age education; (3) adolescent development and participation; (4) social and child protection; and (5) social policy and child rights. Moreover, UNICEF South Africa will continue to adapt to the impacts of COVID-19 on the well-being of children and women within the country.

ESAR,South Sudan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"A key lesson during the EVD response was that integration of related pillars via a coordination platform improved the quality of interventions, harmonized approaches and reduced overlaps. EVD preparedness coordination helped in the rapid roll out of the COVID-19 response, and linkages between national and state level taskforces and technical working groups supported the timely and multisectoral implementation of activities. 
 
UNICEF leveraged its on-the-ground community mobilizers network and activate partnerships with CSOs, to quickly deliver prevention messages to communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Use of digital data collection tools by UNICEF field offices allowed for near real-time and cost-effective generation of rapid evidence products such as a knowledge, attitudes and practices study to inform UNICEF’s COVID-19 response. 
 
The radio distance learning programme has the potential to be implemented beyond COVID-19 to complement the curriculum and expand access to excluded children. Specifically, to provide access to learning for children in hard-to-reach areas due to road accessibility, conflict or natural disasters. To garner long term benefits of investment in teacher education, it is critical to gradually adopt more sustained, decentralized and school-based approaches. A positive shift is expected in teacher education through creating empowered and equipped Community Education Centres and National Teacher Training Institutes.
 
At community level, UNICEF’s support to the development of 649 Parent Teacher Association (PTA) capacities led to more engaged communities in education service delivery. PTAs spearhead campaigns to take OOSC to school and they underpin the growth in the demand for education services.
 
Due to the lack of recent nutrition data, but with good availability of data on contributing factors, UNICEF led the innovation of using historical data to inform an acute malnutrition analysis, among others. The prevalence of acute malnutrition was determined based on how far the contributing factors have worsened compared to the previous contributing factors and historical prevalence of wasting. In 2020, a robust evidence generation structure was institutionalized as part of the C4D network which spearheaded eight research studies and community feedback projects. These provided near to real-time evidence that informed socio-behavioural communication programme planning and implementation.

An increased focus on CNVs will support nutrition counselling and delivery of key MIYCN messages at the community level in 2021. These CNVs will also support caregivers in conducting feeding (cooking) demonstrations and development of kitchen gardens to improve community resilience in lean seasons. 
 
Implementing Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) in urban settings such as Juba presents several challenges particularly lack of community cohesion. However, increasing the involvement of local government at payam level and letting it take the lead increases the acceptance of the approach. In 2021, the establishment of a WASH M&E system at the national and state level will support real-time monitoring of the ODF road map in favourable states, as well as harmonization of tools and verification protocols. UNICEF is also supporting the development of national CLTS guidelines - delayed in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic - which will contribute to a harmonized approach for the sanitation sector in South Sudan.
 
Despite progress in the uptake of maternal, newborn and child health services observed in 2020, continuum of care remains a challenge, due to continued insecurity, access concerns,  inadequacy in qualified health care workers, low awareness and cultural beliefs compounding an already fragile health care system in South Sudan. The absence of an established integrated Human Resources Information System (iHRIS) to map adequate health workforce distribution and low renumeration are impediments to health service delivery. UNICEF is currently collecting heath care worker data in supported health facilities in Jonglei and Upper Nile to support a nascent iHRIS.
 
A joint workplan with the Ministry of Finance and Planning (MoFP) (2019/21) formalized the partnership and positioned UNICEF as a key PFM actor. A strong partnership with UNDP included joint advocacy on PFM by both Representatives. Budget transparency has proved to be a powerful entry point for PFM, helping Government spend better and attracting more external resources. Priority “quick wins” included supporting PFM capacity and budget plans, and developing budget analyses. 
 
As well as the introduction of a PFM dashboard, another significant online innovation was the roll-out of the GBV risk mitigation portal developed by HQ for humanitarian actors. The online training for UNICEF and COVID-19 frontline staff increased the profile of GBV and helped to roll-out GBV training on a larger scale. 
 
The deployment of social workers in one stop centers supported by UNICEF increased the level of support provided to women and girls including GBV survivors who accessed clinical management of rape services in the health facilities. Reactivation of hotlines, increased awareness through radios, and increased airtime for case managers for remote case management, were all measures put in place to ensure continuum of services to women and girls beyond those found at women and girl friendly spaces.
 
As part of research for a new Situation Analysis for the country (publication 2021), multiple focus group discussions were held with key stakeholders including Government, UN agencies, civil society, children and persons with disabilities to obtain their views. Children from the child reporters programme were critical to the feedback process, ensuring that the voices of children were heard.
 
With major gaps in certain sectors, standalone proposals were not bringing in needed funding.  However, integrated funding proposals allowed for resources to go to underfunded areas, through those sectors that were better funded by donors. An integrated approach to funding requests was also better received by donors. In 2021 UNICEF South Sudan will continue to diversify the donor base including exploring additional opportunities with international financial institutions and prioritizing resource mobilization around WASH, education and child protection, the most under-funded sectors. 
 
Successful implementation of a dry season pre-positioning strategy ensured that supplies were available to support programmes in a cost-effective manner throughout the year, particularly in flood prone areas. The importance of pre-positioning of contingency stock during the dry season proved an essential element of timely and effective response to multiple hazards including COVID-19.
"
ESAR,Uganda,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The COVID-19 pandemic was a major impetus for innovation around the world and created opportunities for programmatic learning and enhancement. UNICEF Uganda held a mid-year review to assess and learn from the first months of the COVID response. UNICEF Uganda is part of a global Rapid Assessment on COVID-19, informing new ways of programming moving forward. An independent Country Programme Evaluation of the 2016 – 2020 GoU – UNICEF Country Programme, provided useful insights and reflections into UNICEF programming moving forward. Key lessons learned and recommendations focused on the importance of systems strengthening, strategic monitoring and a decentralized approach in programming. Below the key lessons learned per programmatic area are addressed.
 
Goal 1
The fact that UNICEF has both ‘development’ and ‘emergency’ roles/capabilities and programming helped UNICEF to effectively engage with both COVID-19 emergency response and essential health services continuity. In addition, UNICEF’s health emergency capacities, established over the past three years, were essential to UNICEF’s rapid support to the government in addressing the pandemic. 
 
The lack of universally agreed metrics limited the ability to explicitly measure the district health system’s capacity and the effectiveness of UNICEF-supported actions. To address this challenge, UNICEF and Makerere University, in partnership with MoH and implementing NGOs, designed and implemented the District Health Systems Strengthening (DHSS) capacity monitoring framework, which monitors measures health system improvements in six domains. 
 
Goal 2
An increase in violence against children and teenage pregnancies during school closure, according to reports from districts and the national media, highlighted the fact that children are safest in school, especially where schools are integrated platforms for service delivery across their education, health and child protection needs. Coordinated cross-sectoral efforts with health and child protection programmes were key to ensuring that children receive the required support both during school closure and once schools re-open fully. Alternative platforms, including radio, community-based structures and digital platforms such as Kolibri were extensively employed for learning, skills-building and adolescent participation.
 
The COVID-19 situation highlighted the need for increased programme focus on building breadth of skills of adolescents, from foundational to transferable and job specific, through the logic of continuity and mutual reinforcement between formal and non-formal education. Furthermore, it demonstrated that adolescent participation and programming with adolescents have to be further advanced, as adolescents engaged through the radio in COVID-19 prevention and response proved once again to be important agents of change in their communities.  
 
Goal 3
A key lesson learned was the importance of advocating for, and ensuring the integration of, social welfare in the COVID-19 response right from the onset of the crisis. After successful advocacy, specialized case workers and support teams were jointly deployed to treatment and quarantine centres. In addition, case management for child protection was incorporated into the MoH home-based care strategy for health workers. This allowed for provision of a holistic response to children’s needs and demonstrated the important linkages between social welfare and health, which were strengthened in the COVID-19 response. 
 
A shift towards mobile provision of psychosocial support to children at community level, including in refugee settlements when child-friendly spaces were closed as part of the lockdown, demonstrated the critical role of community structures in providing basic support to children in crisis situations.  
 
The use of innovating approaches, such as U-Report enabled the reach to reach children and their families with messages on child care, VAC and harmful practices during the lockdown. However, it also became clear that it is important to continuously update the U-Report users, including ensuring that there is a balance with gender and age among them. 
 
Goal 4
Previous efforts of strengthening planning, implementation and monitoring WASH activities at the community, sub-county and district levels were key in facilitating rapid scale-up and supporting future sustainability of COVID-19 related investments. For example, the pre-pandemic efforts put into the development of micro-plans for WASH in schools and health facilities helped to fast track certain processes and activities. 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic presented an opportunity to promote and support handwashing with water and soap. It also boosted product innovation and resulted in the development of a hands-free handwashing facility to reduce the transmission of the disease.
 
A key programmatic innovation came from the Self-Sustaining and Safe Sanitation Service (S5) initiative: UNICEF engaged the private sector and impact investors to support the government to develop affordable solutions for decentralized faecal sludge management in urban and peri-urban areas. Apart from addressing a pressing sanitation issue, the S5 initiative will supply a renewable energy product (e.g. fuel briquettes) and reduce cutting trees for household and industrial fuel. It will also encourage a small percentage of profits from the sale of briquettes to be used for social investment.
 
Goal 5
UNICEF supported KCCA in designing and implementing a business continuity plan through which the programme for adolescent girls became the only government-led social protection programme delivering uninterrupted services during the pandemic, effectively leveraging technology for remote service delivery and adjusting implementation using real-time feedback. This programme brought important lessons in highlighting the need to personalize social protection programmes across gender, geography and age as critical levers for effective programming. Furthermore, it exposed the need to consider the optimal combination of digitization, in-person support and community connections, which can also be bundled as “tech, touch and trust.”
 
Programme Support
In 2020, UNICEF Uganda strengthened the efficient and timely coordination and communication between zonal teams and the country office through establishing an Accountability Framework and key reporting mechanisms, ensuring that immediate issues affecting programme implementation were cascaded and addressed in a timely manner. Innovative dashboards tracking programmatic results strengthened results-based management at all levels of UNICEF Uganda. To ensure efficient monitoring, UNICEF Uganda deployed a mix of on site and remote monitoring. Field Monitoring and Accountability to Affected Populations were strengthened through piloting new modules of eTools and U-Report to launch surveys on emergencies to its beneficiaries. This allows UNICEF to better utilize findings from field monitoring and understand what communities would require to be better prepared for emergencies.

"
ESAR,United Rep. of Tanzania,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The COVID-19 pandemic has opened the space for a renewed focus on innovative solutions to scale up handwashing with soap. UNICEF provided technical support to the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology to develop a WASH protocol for the safe reopening of schools, which was implemented in schools nationwide. UNICEF also partnered with entrepreneurs in Mbeya, Iringa, Njombe, Songwe, Kigoma and Dar es Salaam regions and in Zanzibar to fabricate home-grown contactless handwashing stations, which were then distributed to 441 schools and in refugee camps. These were of varying designs and revealed latent technological capacity which, with appropriate support, can spawn local manufacturing of cheap but effective WASH hardware. UNICEF will leverage a new partnership with the private sector to test models for bringing to market locally-designed and manufactured handwashing stations at a cost affordable to schools. At the national level, UNICEF is supporting the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology to develop a national costed plan and investment case for school WASH to attract additional funding for school WASH facilities. Work on these key documents was disrupted due to COVID-19 travel restrictions but is set to resume in January 2021.
 
UNICEF Tanzania continued to utilize the U-Report platform – a social messaging tool and data collection system – to generate real time data on adolescents’ and young people, while promoting access to vital information about COVID-19, with more than 65,000 U-Reporters participating in the weekly COVID-19 polls. One example of how U-Report data was used for action was observed in a poll that focused on U-Reporters knowledge on HIV and COVID-19 prevention. Data from the poll showed that only 24.6 per cent of respondents had correct information about HIV and COVID-19 prevention. As a follow-up, UNICEF worked with the Government and NGO partners to address inaccurate rumours and facilitated access to correct information, reaching 11,000 children, adolescents and pregnant mothers living with HIV and 201,922 adults in 35 districts, including all districts in Zanzibar. An important lesson learned was that returning results to users and delivering them as part of the poll increased the number of respondents. U-Report results are now included at the end of each poll and a set menu with results is shared with users.
 
The Tanzania country office piloted distance learning innovation solutions to train frontline workers to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. One solution successfully tested made use of a combination of the Internet of Good Things (IoGT) and RapidPro for an internet-based system supported by SMS or WhatsApp. The IoGT is a mobile-ready digital platform designed to enable people in remote settings to access educational and lifesaving information without data charge, a facility that became more critical in the context of COVID-19, especially given restrictions to movement. In total, 200 frontline workers from eight districts were trained using the IoGT and RapidPro system, enabling them to provide psychosocial support to children and families in need. The prototype has since been adopted by other UNICEF offices such as UNICEF Pacific and UNICEF Mexico.
 
UNICEF Tanzania participated in two global digital challenges focusing on skills building, initiated by UNICEF’s East and Southern Africa Regional Office. Through the COVID-19 and #ReImagineYourFuture challenges, over 500 participants were exposed to human-centred design methodologies that fostered creativity and self-reflection skills. In 2021, these digital challenges will be coordinated through the UNICEF Tanzania Adolescent Taskforce. The taskforce will implement a partner mapping exercise so that successful participants of the challenges receive additional support and resources from partners to enable their ideas to move into prototyping or product stages.
 
UNICEF supported the Tanzania Innovation Week 2020, which showcased the most recent locally-built innovations. A total of 5,694 participants attended multiple events during the week. UNICEF, in close collaboration with the Youth 4 Children Innovation Hub of the University of Dar es Salaam and the private sector company Launchpad, hosted a panel discussion on the role of education technology in Tanzania and a follow-up event showcasing education technology innovations. Through these panels and discussions, UNICEF started mapping potential partners in the education technology space and defined a trial collaboration area to deliver educational content through SMS. During school closures due to COVID-19, UNICEF initiated the use of U-Report to deliver SMS-based education content. Though this first step was not sustained, it generated lessons in partnership. UNICEF is continuing to work with the Tanzania Institute of Education to improve and expand the use of digital systems in education.
 
UNICEF Tanzania engaged with mothers through its Mama na Mwana service, an SMS system designed to collect information about quality of maternal, neonatal and postnatal care. Following the outbreak of COVID-19, UNICEF also provided information about COVID-19 and collected data on disruption of essential health services. Findings highlighted that immunization services had not been disrupted by COVID-19, with 89.6 per cent of those who sought services able to access them. Through Mama na Mwana, 12,002 mothers accessed UNICEF’s COVID-19 content or provided responses to polls. Mama na Mwana was also evaluated as part of the broader endline evaluation of the project ‘Saving mother’s and children’s lives through innovative, sustainable and comprehensive reproductive, mother, child and adolescent health services’. Lessons learned were highlighted, including the need to further institutionalize the programme with the Mobile Health section of the MoHCDGEC and to synergize and integrate it with the ongoing Wazazi Nipendeni programme managed by USAID/Cardno. These lessons will be taken forward in 2021.

ESAR,Zambia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Programme implementation in 2020 experienced challenges that were both unique to Zambia and universal across other country offices. These included an outbreak of Vaccine Derived Polio Virus type-2 (cVDPV2), in-country security (gassing) incidences in the earlier part of the year, a deteriorating fiscal environment, and the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Despite these challenges, UNICEF Zambia, in partnership with the Government, UN Agencies, Cooperating and Implementing Partners continued to deliver results for children and young people in the various outcome areas.  During this period, UNICEF Zambia learnt several lessons and deployed some innovative choices and decisions aimed at mitigating the risks, whilst at the same time maximizing the realisation and delivery of the planned 2020 programme results.  Lesson Learned #1: UNICEF’s efforts to help sustain the continuity of essential services through a programme criticality review and development of programme continuity plans, including guidelines/SoPs on the continuity of essential services, helped prioritise and focus on high-impact interventions. These programme criticality reviews informed engagement with donors in relation to programme duration, re-prioritisation and reprogramming. Examples include completing the polio (cVDPV2) outbreak response campaign and enhancing the monitoring of COVID-19 consequences on health systems and services. Amid simultaneous and multiple public health emergencies, UNICEF’s strategic niche of balancing humanitarian and development efforts contributed to the minimal disruption of essential services, as demonstrated by the 10 to 15 percent coverage reduction which while not insignificant could have been worse. Furthermore, collective and concerted efforts by the UNICEF team with GRZ, donors and implementing partners on policy advocacy and resource mobilisation helped keep the momentum of routine essential health services while sustaining investments in building the resilience of health systems through strengthening medical oxygen and cold chain systems.  Lesson Learned #2: The implementation of the Emergency Cash Transfer (ECT) by using existing SCT caseloads and systems demonstrated the feasibility of building shock-responsive social protection systems in Zambia. Coordinating between the MCDSS and the Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit increased the appetite for shock-responsive systems and harmonised targeting approaches. UNICEF Zambia also learned that its internal systems can manage cash transfers on a large scale through long term agreements with mobile network operators and banks that offer cash-in-transit services. The integration of PSEA through trainings of district officers and briefings of contractors, community volunteers and beneficiaries was recognised as critical by MCDSS, and it is now being integrated into the regular social cash transfer programme. Notwithstanding, the amount of effort and risk management associated with such a massive undertaking requires not only a whole of office (multiple sections working seamlessly together), but a whole of UNICEF approach (linking Regional Office and HQ in rapid or real time to efforts and decision-making) Lesson Learned #3: Given Zambia’s decentralised governance structure, another lesson learnt has been that budget analysis at the national level while necessary, is not sufficient to inform the local/ sub sectors. As service delivery happens at the local level, analysing budgets and resource flows at the local level would likely provide useful information for public and policy advocacy. Towards this end, UNICEF conducted a rapid budget analysis of the social sector allocations. This rapid analysis was then disseminated and is being used to support advocacy with parliament and civil society to spotlight the concerns related to stagnant or falling allocations to education, health and WASH as a percentage of the overall budget, currently accounting for 27 percent.   
Lesson Learned #4:    The development of the WASH Sector Contingency and Response Plan and Education Sector Response Plan at the very onset of the COVID-19 emergency, were a good initiative that helped government and partners agree on the priority actions to focus on, and also helped mobilise resources towards this.  The swift development of the Education Sector Response Plan resulted in accessing GPE Accelerated Funding for Zambia.  Similarly, the development and implementation of a business continuity plan for the WASH programme successfully enabled UNICEF Zambia and partners to continue supporting critical WASH services even during the period when movements were restricted
 Lesson Learned #5: Lack of fund allocations by GRZ for nutrition services amidst a shrinking government fiscal space affected service delivery. The inclusion of SAM treatment as part of the high-impact nutrition interventions package within the SUN-II programme has ensured the delivery of a nutrition programme that is both preventive and curative. Additionally, employing a system strengthening approach, with a focus on supply chain management, capacity building of service providers, strengthening data management and demand creation in the IMAM programme has helped to build a resilient health system.  Lesson Learned #6 It is possible to leverage a large and wide-ranging development programme in support of a humanitarian response and meaningfully operationalize the humanitarian-development nexus. UNICEF Zambia was able to build on and expand existing programmes in WASH, Health, Social Protection, Nutrition, Education and Child Protection, and not only leverage existing programmatic priorities and funding, but mobilize additional Other Regular Resources as well as emergency funding in support of the COVID-19 response.  UNICEF’s track record in delivering results for children not only led to increased resources for our programmes, but for the overall UN appeal under the leadership of the Resident Coordinator. Lesson Learned #7 2020 once again confirmed that Core Resources (RR) are a most effective “first responder” and enable UNICEF to be proactive, agile and to deliver immediately in a crisis situation. For example, the reprogramming of Regular Resources before the first cases of COVID-19 arrived in Zambia allowed us to kick start the response in Risk Communication and Communication Engagement, Infection Prevention and Control, and Diagnostics and facilitated early action a full one month before the first Other Resources were raised."
ESAR,Zimbabwe,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Beyond illustrating that the programme ToC and results logic are sound, the UNICEF experience in Zimbabwe in 2020 produced numerous lessons learned that offer great potential to accelerate results at scale going forward. 
 
Preparedness, flexibility and swift adaptation are critical to mitigate risks, ensure continuity of programming and achieve results. While having preparedness measures and systems in place was critical to shifting gears and scaling up in 2020, there remained a need for strengthened national emergency preparedness and contingency planning, complemented by agile and flexible approaches when emergencies do arise, as also highlighted in the 2019 Real Time Evaluation of the Cyclone Idai response. The flexibility displayed by donors and other partners was critical in facilitating reprogramming, continuity of activities and timely COVID-19 response efforts, particularly in Zimbabwe’s multi-hazard context. Exercising agility, such as shifting to local PPE procurement, can result in cost savings and facilitate timely delivery. Other related 2020 insights included that RBF served as a critical safety net in the absence of other measures to bridge service gaps related to protracted labour disputes; and community-based primary health care offers good value for money for emergency preparedness, response and resilience.  
 
In 2020, UNICEF achieved results through an array of operational modalities, such as integrated/convergent approaches and innovative/technological initiatives, while also leveraging opportunities, particularly in the education space, that will continue to serve children and ensure AAP going forward. Although COVID-19 highlighted a gap in technological interventions and disparities in access to technology for children, especially those with disabilities, the pandemic also offered valuable insights regarding the way forward on making learning more accessible for all children and addressing the digital divide, such as through Giga; the Learning Passport and other digital education mechanisms. In response to COVID-19-induced closures of victim-friendly courts, UNICEF worked with the Judicial Service Commission to explore the feasibility of virtual victim-friendly courts. Lessons learned in the preliminary investigations included that the virtual courts will deliver speed and efficient improvements to the justice system. This innovation will bring justice closer to the people and UNICEF expects to model e-courts in 2021. UNICEF co-chairs the Zimbabwe Child Online Protection Taskforce (ZICOP), also in collaboration with Econet, which has proved important for raising awareness of issues and tapping into private sector expertise. The COVID-19 response also provided ripe ground for both integrated outreach and innovative programming, such as the linking of health, nutrition and protection efforts to ensure equity in essential interventions and resilience against future shocks, resulting in more children being reached in 2020, particularly those in remote communities. Examples of innovations undertaken in 2020 include the design of foot-operated handwashing facilities appropriate for COVID-19 and the piloting of water kiosks using tap card systems to dispense water to paying beneficiaries at an affordable rate. 
 
The events of 2020 demonstrated the importance of listening to communities in ensuring quality programming and impact. For example, community engagement for AAP has opened an opportunity for increased male involvement in nutrition programs. The ESCT programme harnessed technology for programme delivery with use of tablets and digital data collection tools linked to RapidPro to enable frequent, remote and cost-effective recipient engagement.  Building and expanding upon existing data and monitoring technologies—such as RapidPro, U-Report and the Ona platform—helped the office rapidly switch gears to emergency programming for the COVID-19 response and facilitated real-time monitoring and stakeholder feedback to inform decision making in crises, such as determining communication and RCCE content and strategy. During the pandemic and subsequent lockdown, UNICEF worked with Government and implementing partners to apply innovative and digital means to maintain the coordination and delivery of essential protection services, including remote case management and mobile legal aid clinics. From an internal perspective, UNICEF reduced its paper use as a result of working from home, generating environmental benefits. This paperless practice and other greening approaches will be continued to contribute to related organizational objectives even in a future context absent of COVID-19-related teleworking requirements. 
 
UNICEF investments over time have produced good relationships with Government that allowed UNICEF to substantively support the COVID-19 response. UNICEF effectively utilized rapidly collected data and other evidence to advocate with donors for investment in health as indicators slid amid a challenging operating context. In terms of partnerships, taking a multi-sector and multi-stakeholder approach—particularly as related to social mobilization—has been a key area of success. Engaging CSO partners en masse has helped to foster dialogue and trust, while also generating practical solutions to common problems. Strategic partnerships with key institutions and figures, such as Parliament and the Ministries responsible for finance and local government, are important to influencing policy and actions that support the realization of results for children. In particular, strategic advocacy focused on a few manageable and collectively understood priorities ensures results. 
 
Global supply chains in 2020 were seriously impacted by COVID-19, creating delays in sourcing supplies and then shipping them, including for PPE, which affected the ability of ZCO to access and procure PPE hindering the immediate continuation of services, particularly impacting frontline workers. Delays in procurement had a knock-on effect in terms of being able to partner with CSOs and supply our partners with necessary equipment and supplies, delaying programme implementation. A key lesson is that developing and strengthening robust local procurement will be a key element moving forward, as will be investing in the capacity of local suppliers and strengthening regional supply networks. To ensure quality, UNICEF will also need to scale up programme monitoring which was a big challenge in 2021, and will do so through increasing staff visits (while adhering to safety protocols) while also building on remote and third party monitoring approaches fostered in 2020. Finally, UNICEF was able to manage the impact of volatile economic policies in terms of cost increases and dwindling supplier confidence by establishing long term agreements. This allowed containing the prices by giving a sense of continued long-term business opportunities for vendors and contributed to the market resilience through the combined purchasing power of UN agencies during pandemic.

LACR,Argentina,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
KEY LESSONS LEARNED 
 
The key lesson learned was that results achieved in this exceptionally challenging year would not have been possible without innovation, flexibility and creativity. CO response was fast-enough to reprioritize efforts towards the COVID-19 Response Plan, to meet the evolving needs resulting from the pandemic and the lockdown measures. Innovation, flexibility, creativity and seeking of new opportunities were key elements to ensure resource mobilization results, as well as for the management of the team during uncertain times, putting in place novel approaches to facilitate work-life balance, maintain staff motivation ensuring their protection and safety. 
 
The context of 2020 highlighted the importance of proper preparation for unexpected situations and emergency. The implementation of the BCP since its activation in March was overall smooth and it could be maintained since its activation to the end-year without major hiccups. 
Finally, CO maintained its alertness on the themes prioritized in the current CPD and was able to take advantage of the window of opportunity to position itself in those (e.g. advocacy on the importance of the front labeling law for obesity prevention ratified in the Upper Chamber in November 2020).
 
EVIDENCE GENERATION 
An innovation was the use of the 2019 MICS sample-framework to implement 4 nationally representative rapid assessments on the impact of the pandemic on children and their families. This information contributed to putting children rights in the public debate and inform and tailor public policies decision-making including UN’s tailoring response plan and socioeconomic analysis. Timely generation and dissemination of evidence provided the content the CO needed to argue that children were hidden victims of COVID-19 opening the door to the President's bilateral meeting, putting the issue in the media coverage and positioning UNICEF as an authoritative voice on the pandemic. 
 
Furthermore, in a national context battered by a general heightened concern for the socio-economic situation and political polarization, a thoroughly planned, and regularly adjusted advocacy and COVID19 response plans proved essential to position UNICEF as a trust-worthy voice for children in the public arena and to avoid at the maximum extent possible the risk of inappropriate use of UNICEF’s brand and word. 
 
SCOPE 
Going behind the traditional implementation modality that characterize an office in UMIC, the emergency required the CO to combine the more traditional evidence-based advocacy work with service delivery by the provision of more direct assistance, e.g. through the procurement of PEP supplies for the health system, as well as through partnership with grassroot organizations in relation to improve nutrition in most vulnerable populations. While the swift to a more downstream approach has not been obvious, results have been highly positive. Thus alliances with grassroot organisations with a presence and legitimacy nationwide, provided CO the needed reach, and allowed working with urban inequities that were out of scope before. 
 
 
OUT-OF-THE-BOX PROGRAMMING: 
An instance of programme innovation relates to UNICEF’s support to the alternative care institutions and juvenile detention centres. The magnitude of the project, that sought to cover 24 provinces with items for more than 10K children and more than 11K staff members working in these institutions and centres, and the operational constraints during the emergency forced UNICEF to think ‘outside-of-the-box’. The CO worked in close collaboration with SENNAF and with provincial authorities to develop a cash transfer initiative, AUNAR, to support all alternative care institutions and juvenile detention centres across the country.  The cash transfer system was developed to combine adequate levels of flexibility for the institutions and centres, and a sufficient level of oversight for the authorities. AUNAR had several benefits – the system was prompt to implement and brought critical added value by establishing an updated database of all alternative care institutions and juvenile detention centres in the country, and a direct channel of communication for the national authorities with these local institutions. Monitoring is ongoing through the information (on items purchased and resources invested) provided by the financial institution managing the debit cards. Additionally, an external assessment is planned for 2021. 

VIRTUALITY
While some activities planned prior to the pandemic had to be put at an alt because of the context, several others were made possible by adapting them to the virtual world. This was the case for the support to the national plan to guarantee continuity in education. The adaptation of educational activities in juvenile detention centers into online workshops was critical for the continuity of social-educational activities for adolescents living in challenging conditions. In the health programme, the early virtualization of programs was to be a key tool to ensure access and continuity of essential services during the pandemic, including through online adolescent health. 
 
Virtuality also allowed to continue listening to the voices of adolescents while in confinement by U-report surveys and with virtual workshops of the GenU Adolescent Committee.
 
Finally, in the CPD development process the CO was able to implement extensive consultation process including adolescents and private sector, guaranteeing integration of all stakeholders throughout the CPD planning cycle. CLAC, GPR and mapping actors reports were inputs to shape some CPD’s strategic lines and expected results. Finally, by means of main CPE’s recommendations (e.g. intersectoral approach, upstream work, design of ToC for new interventions) the CO was able to tailor expected results for 2021-2025 period. 
MONITORING 
An innovation worth highlighting is the local monitoring process to the direct assistance provided to disadvantaged groups through two grassroot organizations. Despite the difficulties imposed by the lockdown, a participatory process to receive the feedback from beneficiaries was reached (AAP), which was crucial to constantly improve the strategy along the way.
The CO participated in the LACRO-led Real Time assessment of the COVID-19 response, which provided important feedback on the adaptability of the office, implementation and quality of the COVID-19 response. Its recommendations confirmed the local analysis and have been taken into consideration for the continuation of the COVID-19 response in 2021 and for the finalization of the CPD 2021-2025. At subnational level, evidence generation, provision of supplies, capacity building (frontline workers, caregivers), and partnerships were key to tailor and continue mitigating immediate COVID19’s effects.
"
LACR,Barbados,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Throughout 2020, a success in programme and office  operations was the ease in transitioning from face-to-face interactions to remote online working modality. As a result of extensive testing of the  Business Continuity Plan and emphasis on a paperless environment, the office  smoothly adapted work approaches to programme delivery in a  remote setting. Following the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, there was no  disruption in programme delivery across the sub-region. All staff were able  to transition seamlessly from a physical to a remote work environment. While  remote working addressed continuity of programmes, the importance of ensuring  a balance between focused time to participate in online meetings and;  guaranteeing staff were not unduly overwhelmed and were afforded the time  needed to attend personal matters and self-care was critical.

In 2020, UNICEF consistent and strategic engagement in evidence generation  actively supported national priorities for children and their families and  programme implementation and advocacy within the ECA. The approach has been  to leverage and expands partnerships to generate robust child-related data,  mainstream child poverty into national reports and data mining and analysis  related to key population groups. This strategy has been enhanced by  leveraging existing data sources for secondary analysis, including  administrative data and household survey data to inform programming  priorities. It has also been important to consistently monitor programme  implementation with key partners to increase efficiencies and identify  innovative solutions to challenges. Two evaluations are ongoing, which include an evaluation of the current country programme and the Dominica Country Report of the Global ‘Evaluation of approaches to social protection programming in humanitarian situations’. Recommendations will shape the formulation of the new Multi-Country Programme Document (2022-2026); and future joint cash-based programming.

The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the ECA countries to new learning approaches, shifting from traditional classroom teaching to using various online approaches.  However, regional capacities to manage, deliver, and access online  and blended education are still far from adequate. Whilst countries have been  taking actions to integrate technology into classrooms; COVID-19 pandemic  underscored the significant gaps in making this a reality. On the one hand,  gaps in teacher capacity to effectively develop and deliver quality  instruction through the virtual and blended modalities, inadequate access to  devices and internet services in schools and homes posed major barriers to  effective learning. On the other hand, adaptation, and adoption of global  standard operating procedures to facilitate safe school reopening was an intensive  process requiring full involvement of the various stakeholders, including  teachers, principals, parents, unions, other Ministries. Special mechanisms  were required to capture students voices. Simultaneously, while implementing  relevant protocols for school reopening, large class sizes in tight  classrooms posed challenges for physical distancing, leading to the adoption  of shift systems. This resulted in tensions between safety, access and  quality learning. Finding the right mix of instructional approaches that met  students’ needs, teachers and parents continue to be a challenge that will  need a solution in the second year of the pandemic.
   
While the Convention on the Rights of the Child reporting process has  undoubtedly inspired and drawn political attention to children’s rights and  model laws and policies have been developed, ECA countries had been  generally slow in revising existing laws and regulations to include legal  guarantees of and responsibilities for responding to violations of children  rights. As a result of UNICEF’s continued investments and high-level advocacy  on longstanding law and policy reform across the sub-region, as an agency and  together with UN and sub-regional partners like the OECS Commission, positive  results for the family and child protection reform agenda were it successfully  leveraged. With the focus on reaching populations through digital  communication, the implications for digital inequality has surfaced, as  populations vary in their quality of internet access and skills and there  were concerns relating to how to ensure the reach of the most vulnerable  children and their families with services and messages. The adaptability  social services were also under scrutiny as these are usually best-delivered  face-to-face. Going forward, these reflections must be taken into account if  social services continue to be provided remotely. 
   
Activities supporting youth engagement in climate action were implemented  through UNICEF active involvement and partnership development. However,  partners have limited financial resources, and many youth-led initiatives  remain informal. In the longer term, dedicated funds will be required to  build partners’ capacities and support more structured youth networks.  Leveraging national and regional partnerships continues to be a key to  sustaining evidence generation efforts across the ECA sub-region. A key  lesson learned was that UNICEF ECA’s consistent and strategic engagement in  evidence generation would provide support to not only national priorities for  children and their families across the ECA sub-region but also UNICEF ECA’s  programme implementation and advocacy. The upholding and expanding of  traditional media channels to communicate and advocate continued to drive  results for children even in the face of a rapidly expanding social media presence.  Alliances with telecommunication and media companies must continue to be  pursued in order to make sure that UNICEF’s messages penetrate all markets,  especially vulnerable sections of the populations who do not have consistent  access to digital media. 
   
While there are many lessons learned in the context of the migrant response during  2020, the following three have been the highlights. First, buy-in and  ownership of national partners are critical not only to mitigate political  sensitivities but also to enable that migrant and refugee children receive  key services from the national institutions. While there is a shift in the  incorporation of Spanish language into programmes and services, more  bilingual services are needed at the national and community level to meet the  demands of migrants. Second, the blended approach to education demonstrated enormous  capacity to adapt and expand to increase the reach of children who would have  otherwise seen their vulnerabilities exacerbate. Third, the expansion and  innovation in psychosocial support services also mitigated lockdown measures  combined with the vulnerabilities affecting the migrant population during the  pandemic. With ‘My, ChildLine App’ children and their families will have  continuous access to child-friendly resources conveniently available in the  palm of their hands.
"
LACR,Belize,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Adapting the Programme for COVID-19 response: 
Given the evolving context of COVID-19, the office needed to adapt to the teleworking modality, adjusting the work plans with partners and ensuring the delivery of results. The Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) under L3 emergency enabled adaptive processes in responding to emergencies.  In this context, one of the major innovations has been continuing programming primarily through virtual and remote modalities. This has included virtual consultations, trainings undertaken by partners, launches of reports, capacity building with Government and Civil Society and ensuring that children and other beneficiaries are reached by alternative means such as text, social media, phone, webinars or U-Report.  

Supporting Duty of Care and staff well being: 
Critical to the overall functionality of the office was the challenge of staff adapting to the work from home modality and the strict measures being put in place to curb the spread of the pandemic, with the required support both in terms of resources as well as their mental health, whilst continuing to deliver the critical results and commitment for children.  The establishment of a Crisis Management Team to review duty of care, staff wellbeing and phased return to office modality was instrumental in keeping the office functional and a partner of choice by the Government to respond to the evolving crisis.

Data collection, analysis and policy advocacy:
Despite not being able to interact physically with partners and duty bearers during the national lockdown, there was a crucial need to have data on the evolving effects of the pandemic. UNICEF therefore harnessed the innovation and knowledge generated via the MICS Plus Pilot, strengthening the operation of its Call Centre, as a key element to a quick response for data in emergencies. Including understanding COVID-19 pandemic knowledge, protection measures and support for policy measures; offering support to government for expanding cash transfers programmes; and conducting a National Parenting Study.
Among other relevant impacts of COVID-19, major national data collection initiatives have been halted, such as the National Census, and a new Country Poverty Assessment, including the development of an MPI. In this context, UNICEF continued to advocate for the need of sustainable Social Protection for children, including the necessity to continue working on medium to long-term actions such as measurement of multidimensional poverty, and establishment of a sustainable Social Protection Floor, in parallel to the immediate response to COVID-19, by building on sound evidence-based analysis such as the SPER. It has proven to be very useful as a policy advocacy tool to highlight major gaps in Social Protection investments in children, define policy recommendations, and advocate for those in high level meetings as well as to include both the data and policy recommendations in major policy documents that will shape UNICEF and UN Belize cooperation framework for the following 5 years.
Another major lesson learned has been the criticality of including an adolescent health component in Belize Country Programme, together with the support provided in terms of knowledge generation and policy development. As a result, Belize now counts: a) with a comprehensive Adolescent health plan that integrates a cross-sectional approach (including government, non-government and civil society) to identify and address the needs and responses to issues affecting adolescents; b) with a first ever set of MMAP tools that support cross-sectional data collection to assess prevalence of common adolescent mental health conditions and access to mental health services.

A key emerging challenge as a consequence of COVID-19, due to strict safety and health measures implemented under various statutory instruments invoked by the government was a tremendous increase in the number of children arrested and charged for covid-19 related offences -300 new arrests and charges of children by March, up to 500 by June 2020-. The office applied several strategies to respond to these extreme rights violations, including developing standards and protocols for Police interaction with Children during COVID-19, and hosted webinars with both high-level police officers and police officers on patrol. UNICEF together with national counterparts made public statements on the impacts of public health related offences on children and the need for more education and diversion from arrest for all matters but even more so for COVID-19 related matters. Additionally, UNICEF partnered with the courts to develop practice directives for magistrates instructing them to dismiss charges of children for offences related to COVID-19.


Emergency preparedness and response: 
With school closure, due to Covid engaging children -especially in preschools- was a major challenge.  The situation was worsened with hurricanes Eta/Iota. As part of the emergency response, UNICEF in collaboration with village councils, devised alternative strategies to facilitate ECD demonstration sessions, using loud-speakers and Public Announcement systems to disseminate information to parents. The emergency response prompted an opportunity to be innovative, while providing further reach to children and families. Roving Care Givers now use phones to check on families to monitor parent/children activities. 
The important work that UNICEF Belize supported on emergency preparedness and Disaster Risk Reduction in 2020 demonstrates that success is dependent on the key cross-sectoral component to all development outcomes for children and adolescents. This also impacts supply management and logistics. With increased emergencies in the region, the National Protocols for the Integrated Protection of Children and Adolescents in Disaster Situations strengthened actions for the protection of children and adolescents. As a lesson learned, the office identified the need for continued investment in emergency preparedness for timely and quality response, and is sourcing emergency surge support to ensure a more cohesive response plan, for both UNICEF and UN agencies.

Moving forward:
Important going forward is the need for UNICEF to remain fit for purpose and the partner of choice within a rapidly evolving context.  Reimagining programming especially in the area of evidence generation, Social Policy, Education -especially Back to School-, Protection, C4D and Communication with a robust monitoring framework. Pivotal in this regard will be strengthening and broadening partnerships as well increasing our digital footprint to strengthen supporters’ engagement, promote child rights and amplify the voices of children and adolescents.
"
LACR,Bolivia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"This was a unique year for UNICEF Bolivia’s programme implementation. The pandemic and socio-political conflicts during 2019-2020 meant that many interventions had to be executed differently. Such adjustments led to stronger preparedness actions and unique lessons learned.
The short-term and transitional nature of the new administration and the replacement of authorities and technical experts throughout the state apparatus hindered coordination and communication to address the emerging health crisis. This situation was a bottleneck in the implementation of the annual workplans with national entities. Thus, UNICEF strengthened joint work with subnational government authorities and civil society organizations to reinforce the effectiveness and impact of their work in the context of the humanitarian response. UNICEF also continued working closely with the municipal associative system. 
During the pandemic, the importance of a clear division of roles and responsibilities among the different levels and coordination mechanisms within a given sector held even more weight. This situation especially revealed gaps in the health, education and social protection sectors’ functioning and highlighted the importance of building capacities for emergency preparedness at all levels to ensure continuity of services. Moving forward, UNICEF will continue strengthening capacities in these sectors through technical assistance to the emergency committees and sectoral coordination groups in all levels.  
A related lesson learned was the importance of advocating for sustained work processes that incorporate technical teams from government counterparts, not just political authorities. The participation of technical teams allowed commitments to be maintained despite the high turnover of authorities (4 Ministers of Health, 3 Ministers of Planning of Development, 2 Ministers of Education, and 3 INE Executive Directors). 
The significant government staff turnover undermined some gains reported in 2019 in terms of capacity building. For instance, political tensions within the transitional government hampered the Ministry of Education from communicating and operationalizing its strategic thinking. Moreover, the Education Strategic Plan which derives from the Economic Development Plan have both come to an end during 2020. The political turmoil did not leave space for the government to prompt the development of a Medium-Term Strategic Plan to guide the vision for the next few years. UNICEF will take advantage of the different studies developed during 2020 regarding the impact of the pandemic in school attendance and learning, the digital divide and others to provide technical advice for the strategic thinking during the education planning cycle for 2021-2025.
Within the context of suspended educational activities, the need to offer virtual education and flexible learning modalities was urgent. UNICEF responded by providing more than 42,000 teachers with digital tools and relevant content to conduct virtual classes in a safe online environment, helping to ensure continuity of learning. The lesson learned was that UNICEF needs to be prepared to provide more support in times of transition than is usually required and to bring it to scale quickly.
UNICEF Bolivia learned how to better develop and deliver virtual training as capacity building measures and reach broader audiences. In some cases, this occurred more equitably. For example, child protection workers in remote parts of the country that usually would not attend training joined. UNICEF will strengthen such strategies with a more in-depth intercultural approach and translation into local languages in 2021. 
UNICEF Bolivia learned that in times of crisis finding solutions that protect essential personnel in all sectors and partners, was the best way forward. For example, ECD programming used a broad range of service delivery modalities, including virtual channels. Safe modalities for service provision helped keep programming going and restart activities that had stopped and even expanded access for some hard-to-reach participants. UNICEF will continue to work with partners using these blended modalities in 2021 and future crises. Nevertheless, it is essential to mention that the lack of Internet connectivity is a challenge that needs to be overcome because it led to further exclusion for some highly vulnerable populations.
Another lesson learned was that the context of a pandemic/crisis is a significant opportunity to advocate for strengthening social protection systems and applying innovations. More than ever before, UNICEF participated in the government's technical discussions on social protection and key aspects of delivering social programmes during emergency contexts. Simultaneously, UNICEF implemented a cash transfer programme for vulnerable children and families using a direct payment modality for the first time. The cash transfers helped families cope with the shock and loss of income caused by strict lockdown measures while minimizing the negative effect COVID-19 had on programme results – since the cash transfer beneficiaries were already part of UNICEF regular programmes and most of them were in social and family reintegration programmes-. Through this, UNICEF learned important lessons about how to design a cash transfer plan, beneficiary selection mechanisms, cash transfer distribution through a financial services provider, and monitoring procedures. UNICEF will build upon this experience in 2021 and in future interventions of this nature.
WASH is another area where UNICEF found a unique window of opportunity to promote long-standing goals. Since this area played a critical role in response to the pandemic, there was an opportunity to accelerate hygiene practices and advocate for the fundamental human right to access adequate water and sanitation. Improving the design of Family Sanitation Modules to give vulnerable families access to adequate sanitation was an achievement, which provides a clear path for scale-up in years ahead. 
While UNICEF improved connectivity and developed digital strategies to enhance its programmes and results for children, traditional media also helped UNICEF achieve institutional visibility while disseminating messages and materials through social networks that supported children, adolescents and families during hardships. Furthermore, UNICEF Bolivia’s social networks grew significantly in 2020, and UNICEF is now the leading UN agency in the development of virtual activities and the number of followers.
Another key finding was that UNICEF’s staff maintained performance and achieved expected results while working remotely from home. Thus, the teleworking option will be kept as a viable alternative for challenging situations when attending the office is impossible, and when flexible arrangements can promote work-life balance.

"
LACR,Brazil,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In a volatile political environment, with massive fake news downplaying the severity of the disease, families, adolescents and pregnant women looked for guidance and advice on COVID-19. UNICEF managed to quickly provide useful information on prevention measures and capitalize on its strong reputation as a reliable and knowledgeable source of information to attract millions of people to its various online platforms. Building on its already strong network, UNICEF mobilized many additional supporters, including celebrities who dedicated online concerts to raise awareness on COVID-19 and raise funds. The dedicated content on social media gained massive interest and led to strong engagement rates. UNICEF learned that the timely mobilization of existing networks and the engagement of new and diverse partners was crucial to ensure large uptake and will remain as a key feature of engagement with stakeholders.
During the pandemic, UNICEF established a Youth Council that enabled the systematic involvement of adolescents and youth as a valuable voice that guided advocacy and mobilization efforts. The Youth Council is represented by boys and girls from various regions, backgrounds, who have been pushing UNICEF to address issues on combating racism, promoting gender equality and respect to LGBTQIA+ identities. Furthermore, they were engaged as volunteer digital firefighters playing an important role by responding to fake news and disseminating messages on COVID-19 prevention. This experience highlighted the added value of having mechanisms in place for a structured participation of young people in decision-making processes, a guiding principle of the next CPD. 
Remote expert support has shown to be very effective to kickstart a new programme and fill expertise gaps. UNICEF benefited from three Emergency Response Team assignments in WASH, Accountability to Affected Populations and Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse. All three were important in supporting teams with needed expertise. In particular, the WASH assignment was critical to design and implement evidence-based Infection Prevention and control strategies and interventions, and to quickly establish and train a WASH team, bringing much needed expertise which was not part of UNICEF programming in Brazil and will serve as the basis for integrating this component in the next CPD. 
COVID-19 motivated UNICEF to test different approaches to deliver results. The development of partnerships with community-based organizations was key to reach the most vulnerable communities and to ensure UNICEF is close to affected populations. This network will certainly be nurtured to continue to address complex issues. The creative use of technology was essential to rapidly move the Municipal Seal capacity building programme into a virtual mode, certainly permanently influencing future modalities enhancing agility, efficiency and reach. Gains from innovations were also visible in the response for Venezuelan migrants in particular with the development of the Super Panas Radio Programme, community kitchens and community surveillance systems that will be sustained in 2021. The pandemic showed that there is a need for innovative and more flexible models of South-South Cooperation engagement, with better use of online technologies and remote technical assistance. Such approaches will need to be developed and reflected in operational frameworks and guidance. 
UNICEF was able to adapt its processes to deliver concrete results. Evidence-based decision-making was central to define target populations and reach the most vulnerable families. The activation of different intersectoral coordination mechanisms raised efficiency, fostered creativity, allowed flexibility in planning and imposed the need of decentralized decision-making to effectively and rapidly respond to emerging needs. The COVID-19 task force, that integrated a diverse group of colleagues from different areas and territories, was a good illustration of how an intersectoral agile forum can facilitate the definition of priorities, inform negotiations and ensure a timely and effective implementation of in-kind and financial contributions. This was a key element of success for mobilizing USD 6.7 million from private partners. Agility and rigorous processes can walk side by side when priorities are clear, galvanizing cross-divisional engagement and collaboration. Many operational and programmatic processes were streamlined, and different monitoring and management tools were created enabling new ways of collaboration. 
By developing a complex operation for the receipt and distribution of in-kind donations, UNICEF managed to position itself as a bridge between the private sector and vulnerable communities. Through a snowball effect, UNICEF mobilized more companies than ever before positioning itself as a partner of choice, strengthening its field image and setting the ground for broader strategic and innovative alliances for results for children. 
The Business Consultative Board showed to be an effective forum to involve CEOs around advocacy priorities and events, to engage them on key initiatives such as 1MiO and to mobilize funds through their networks. Meetings were intensified to get their valuable advices on campaigns and fundraising initiatives in particular to mobilize private companies. CEOs also contributed with inside information which was key to inform our advocacy strategies. Information on telecommunication, for example, was instrumental to unlock resources for school connectivity.
Another important element was the establishment of a partnership with the Brazilian National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES) that concretized after several months of internal and external negotiations allowing for the development of legal provisions that were acceptable to both organizations. This agreement was the basis for multi-million partnerships with a diverse set of companies from different industries. It shows the importance of diversifying the actors with whom UNICEF partners and the potential of risk-informed flexibility to adapt legal provisions and conditions to local specificities. 
Finally, all these results were achieved by investing in staff wellbeing in close coordination with LSA. In a very demanding and stressful context in one of the most hardly hit countries in the world, it has been key to support staff and to adapt to the new work modalities while being innovative in designing new responses. The office hired health professionals to assist and orient staff mitigating anxiety specially for those directly affected by COVID-19. Dedicated sessions by a UN Counsellor, duty-of-care-days and regular all staff meetings were critical to support teams through difficult times. 
These valuable lessons will be incorporated in 2021 priorities and will inform the development of the new CPD.
"
LACR,Chile,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"While COVID-19 has created an unprecedented situation, most challenges and bottlenecks for fulfilling children’s rights have remained similar to previous years. The pandemic has aggravated and highlighted an already existing disparity in society and has hit the most excluded children the hardest, maintaining the relevance of the CPD focus. UNICEF has responded to the acute needs of COVID-19 and provided timely support when facing new challenges by supporting the Government and society in making sure to account for the most excluded children, building on the expertise, credibility and partnerships already made. This has allowed UNICEF to remain relevant, to ensure the humanitarian-development link as well as a smooth transition to the upcoming post-pandemic context. As an example, UNICEF advocated for a sustainable solution to the challenges identified through actively contributing to Congress’s on-going discussion of the new migration law and their debates about the protection mechanisms, migratory regulations and social benefits for immigrant children, regardless of the migration status of their parents or caregivers.
Learning from 2019’s social unrest, UNICEF diversified its strategies and counterparts, strengthening the partnership with civil society during 2020. New key alliances with civil society include the facilitation of a civil society’s coordination mechanism in education and establishing a partnership with radio and TV Educa for expanded outreach to the most excluded children in the country. The highly innovative partnership Tu Voz Cuenta aimed at involving adolescents as equal partners in the governance structure.
Prevention measures for COVID-19, such as social distancing and staying at home, also brought an opportunity for accelerating knowledge sharing. The connectivity and organization of online webinars removed barriers of physical space limitations, accessibility, and time and cost spent to reaching venues. It also allowed panelists´ attendance from more diverse geographical locations including the Easter Islands and Patagonia, and a higher number of participants with diverse backgrounds. During the pandemic, UNICEF hosted six webinars and participated in 15. Themes included the secondary impact of the pandemic on children (aggravated socio-economic inequity), positive parenting, school reopening, active fatherhood and violence against children, among others.
Important lessons were learned about the power of alliance during the discussion of the Migration Law draft bill in Congress. Firstly, the evidence generated in a joint study “Characterization of Migrant Children in Chile” developed in alliance with the Catholic University, NGO partners Colunga Foundation and World Vision, facilitated the generation of timely and concrete messages that reflect the reality of the immigrant children in Chile. The alliance was also able to join voices to express concerns to Congress such as a protection system for immigrant children, family reunification visas, special visas for children regardless of the immigration status of their parents/caregivers, and rights to access economic, social and cultural activities. Secondly, the development of a joint advocacy strategy with a common objective strengthened key messages for Congress members and the public. The messages were amplified and made visible in different environments as alliance members expressed opinions on their own channels (such as SNS, opinion columns in the main newspapers and TV/radio interviews) with their natural counterparts to emphasize the importance of the adequate protection for immigrant children.  
Lessons were learned about the power of partnership with TV channels to disseminate messages for children, even during the internet era. Children from the most vulnerable families continue to watch public TV channels as their access to cable TV and internet is limited. A partnership with a public TV channel, TV Educa Chile, allowed a large-scale dissemination of UNICEF messages. TV Educa was among the three most viewed children's channels during its first months of transmission in 2020, with an average rating of 35,000 people per minute – a 76% increase from its first week (Kantar Ibope 2020). The average outreach was over 100,000 children of ages of 4–12, and it is viewed by one out of every three children who watch TV. Video clips developed with various partners were made available to TV Educa, for example “Quarantine 31”, “My Home, My Field” (13 video clips) and “Stories at Home” with more than 200 mini-videos produced by children of the project “From my Window”. The Quarantine 31 series was also broadcast throughout Latin America by Cartoon Network and Boomerang reaching 48 million homes and 32 million homes, respectively.  
Two key lessons were learned for in-country fundraising when faced by the major challenge of adjusting its F2F strategy due to movement restrictions after the social unrest in 2019 and lockdowns due to the pandemic in 2020. Firstly, the importance of diversifying strategies to mitigate the risk of having just one big provider or one channel acquisition. The effort to acquire new donors was rapidly reoriented into strategies for telemarketing, DRTV and digital. The second was about the importance to cultivate the relationship with pledge donors. This was achieved by temporarily shifting agents from the streets to making phone calls from home, and by maintaining the support and investment in all F2F agencies to keep up their operations. Thanks to this epic effort, 13,697 new donors were acquired by the end of November. This effort was reinforced by retaining 80% of existing donors.

LACR,Colombia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Innovation: local content development for Risk Communication and Community Engagement through community media

The COVID-19 context, quarantine and the risks to families, led UNICEF Colombia to identify new and innovative channels and platforms that inform communities, promote their participation and empowerment, and reduce rumours. 

To face these challenges, UNICEF Colombia designed the C4D strategy Somos Enlace (We are link) based on community radios and alternative platforms to ensure families have access to relevant information on COVID-19 prevention. The radio is the platform with the most reach in Colombia according to the Ideas para la Paz Foundation, and community radios are the only media available in half of Colombia’s municipalities. UNICEF partnered with five local, community and youth-based organizations, two of them indigenous, to roll-out a communication strategy with locally-produced information, that would be available and meaningful to the communities, reflecting their cultural values. This information is produced in a participatory way and locally; comprising mainly radio while including printed and social media and face to face interactions for remote indigenous groups. 

The strategy includes forty community radios and alternative media in 19 departments, reaching families with key-life saving information. It is based on three pillars -- strengthening capacities of community and local alternative media; fostering resilience, empowerment, and community integration; and ensuring mechanisms to accountability to affected population (AAP). The capacity strengthening pillar includes thematic guidelines about UNICEF priorities, technical communication guidance and equipment, enhancing relevance and sustainability.

The second pillar consists of participative media production, with children, adolescents, teachers, parents and caregivers involved in production. It also includes a community rumour tracking where media producers identify rumours that negatively affect their communities. This helped design the capacity building sessions as well as the editorial boards, where producers prioritize production. The third pillar, AAP mechanisms, refers to ensuring community feedback to evaluate the relevance of the information produced and respond to additional demands.  

The appropriate combination of communication channels allows UNICEF to reach families in remote territories, who speak and read different languages and who lack internet access or electricity through indigenous, afro, migrant, rural, youth, and LGTBIQ radios and alternative platforms. 

The C4D strategy has reached 50,157 people through community radio; 13,000 people have participated in local production, and 9,000 people have expressed their questions and concerns through AAP mechanisms.

The COVID-19 drove UNICEF Colombia to innovate in its work with communities, finding that community radios and alternative media can reach these communities; promote the participation of children and adolescents in local production, allowing UNICEF Colombia reach new territories; measure change through community rumor tracking; measure interaction and participation; and programme at scale through a community radio network. Further, the strengthening of local media results in the strengthening of participation in decision-making; enhances the right of communities to represent themselves. UNICEF accomplished to support a role already present among communities, creating a network of allies rather than a contractual relationship with a partner. This ensures sustainability and scalability as it allows media producers to become mentors to smaller and newer local and community media.

Lesson learned: Redoubling efforts on the prevention to sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA)

UNICEF Colombia has engaged in major programmatic and operational efforts on PSEA and sexual harassment (SH), in line with UN and UNICEF global priorities. UNICEF Colombia designed a PSEA & SH system including six outputs with related activities and indicators, addressing both internal and external factors, including the contributions to the UN Task Force (co-led by UNICEF Colombia since September 2020). 

During 2020, UNICEF Colombia prioritized the development of supplementary PSEA/SH face-to-face training, which was adapted for virtual roll-out due to the COVID-19 context. The training reached 100 per cent staff members, 99 per cent UNV, 99 per cent consultants, 511 participants from 40 IPs (100 per cent of the total IPs) and 81,5 per cent of people from key third-party contractors, such as Face to Face (F2F) fundraising agencies. Pre and post-tests show an average improvement of about 9 percentage points in participants knowledge following the trainings. As of today, 22 IPs have completed PSEA risk assessment with UNICEF Colombia already monitoring their improvement plans.  Three major lessons learned have been identified in the process:

Not all IPs have prior knowledge/experience on PSEA or GBV, especially those working with programmatic components different from child protection. Seeing this, UNICEF Colombia adjusted trainings to make language less technical and encourage more contextualized dialogue with participants to better discuss key terms on PSEA. In addition, participants who do have previous knowledge have very different understandings and perceptions on PSEA.

Field experience showed the need to adapt the PSEA risk assessment tool to the specific context, due to cultural and sociological reasons (e.g., adjusting time to deploy the PSEA risk evaluation, sometimes through phases; documenting means of verification when communities mostly rely in oral communication, such as indigenous and afro Colombian organizations).
IPs showed valuable knowledge and experience on addressing GBV with local institutions when cases are perpetrated by community members. However, there is room for improvement on the capacity to inform and manage cases on SEA, when committed by its staff, often due to the lack of internal policies.

Looking into 2021, to address these challenges, UNICEF will:

Continue to prioritize capacity building on IPs that require additional training on GBV and PSEA knowledge and tools.
Develop real case studies to better understand how and to what extent it is necessary to adjust the PSEA risks assessment tool to improve IP´s capacities on PSEA.
Adjust concepts to better communicate key terms on PSEA considering the diversity of participants and the context where programmatic initiatives take place.
Share different experiences and good practices on PSEA among IPs to improve their systems, regarding internal policies and procedures, promoting peer-to-peer exchanges-
Conduct internal workshops with staff to analyze PSEA risk’s factors (structural and underlying) that were identified with during IP trainings sessions. The analysis will provide recommendations to mainstream PSEA in the upcoming CPD (2021-2024), in both humanitarian response and development.

"
LACR,Costa Rica,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Programme flexibility and adaptability were a paramount in the reporting year, ensuring that UNICEF would fulfill its obligation with children and adolescents no matter how serious and profound the crisis was. Within few days, all staff and partners had to work remotely to cope with the COVID-19 emergency, shifting the presential field and office work to the digital platforms and, at the same time, assessing the impact of the pandemic on children and adolescents, especially the most vulnerable ones. 

Within this new scenario, the office has embarked in a critical emergency response in close coordination with the National Emergency Commission (CNE) and the UN agencies. For the first time in decades, the office has procured over 125,000 Education, Child Protection and WASH supplies, including Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) and implemented other emergency activities, including local coordination with partners to ensure children were protected against the infection and the increased cases of violence and negligence, including GBV and sexual abuse. UNICEF rapidly engaged with the MoE to support the development of a home-based learning programme, called ´Aprendo en Casa´ and highly advocated for the schools reopening in coordination with PANI, UNESCO, UNFPA and the RCO. Schools will reopen in February 2021. Around 256,229 students from 642 prioritized schools (21% of national enrollment) were directly supported by UNICEF, USAID and the American Embassy with WASH supplies for a safe return to classes. 

The regular programme was adapted to virtual platforms and a series of capacity building activities implemented across the sectors, supporting partners to work digitally and ensuring that the trainings would be effectively implemented. The office has agreed to use one single digital platform for trainings, allowing inter-sectoral and multisectoral learnings which has proved to be a good way to promote integrated programme approaches.
 
UNICEF innovated in Costa Rica by utilizing U-Report as a digital tool for real-time monitoring of adolescent and young people´s wellbeing and providing mental health support. Results from April and September showed an increase from 11% to 29% of adolescents and YP feeling depressed; from 4% to 14% feeling worried about themselves; while anxiety had decreased from 34% to 31%. Nearly half of them also had pessimistic perception about their future. In partnership with the Youth and Culture Ministry, Professional Association of Psychology, Red Cross and NGOs like Parque La Libertad, Red de Juventudes y Cambio Climático y La Ruta del Clima, Women Connecting and the Scouts, UNICEF has implemented several online programmes with and for adolescents and YP, providing direct support through mental health activities and empowering them to cope with the challenges imposed by COVID-19. Around 226 adolescents and YP, most of them girls, were directly engaged in life skills, entrepreneurship and youth engagement activities, raising their voices and concerns on issues that affect their lives and developing community-based projects. Online mental health sessions have reached 120 adolescents directly and 14,500 people via Facebook. A hotline service for children and adolescent was also established in partnership with the Professional Association of Psychology. 

UNICEF and partners have engaged, for the first time, 37 volunteers who directly supported 139 children under the age of 5 years old and 89 mothers, fathers and caretakers from vulnerable communities nation-wide. Young professionals like nurses, psychologists, teachers, artists and lawyers were trained by the new UNICEF Costa Rica INSPIRA Volunteer Programme and devoted their knowledge, time and attention to support children’s full development, even from remote, teaching parents and caretakers how to take care of them, to stimulate their physical, emotional and cognitive development and create a violence-free and protective environment for children within their homes and communities. In a time when kindergartens and schools were closed and violence against children was on the rise, the volunteers’ support were essential to help parents to cope with the unprecedent situation and protect their children from violence, enjoying the interactions with the little ones through games,  low-cost educative toys and dialogue. Results from the programme´s exit survey showed that only two weeks after the workshops, the percentage of families that had implemented positive parenting techniques as reading books, assessing child´s feelings and increased quality playtime had increased in more than 40%. In 2021 UNICEF will expand the reach of INSPIRA, in coordination with its allies. 

Another new programmatic approach initiated in 2020 was the development of a national methodology to measure public budget for children and adolescent on a yearly basis. Through an alliance between a government institution (National Child Welfare Agency /PANI), the academy (University of Costa Rica) and UNICEF, a methodological approach for measurement of public budget for children and adolescents were developed and implemented, engaging over 60 institutions. It was a participatory study, providing disaggregated data.  The project seeks to promote effectiveness, efficiency, equity and transparency in decision-making related to public budget, as recommended by the Observation number 19 of the Child Rights Committee. It informs how public resources are invested, allowing decision-makers to take evidence-based decisions that contribute to reducing the social inequalities that affect many children and adolescents, especially those from indigenous, afro-descendants and migrant communities. The total public resources dedicated to children and adolescents was 4,347 million US dollars equivalent to 8.3% of GDP, and on average almost 3,263 dollars per child per year.  Most of the funds went to Education (60.6%); followed by Health (20.6%); Justice &Security (7.8%); Social Protection (6.8%); Housing and other community services (3.1%); Recreation, Sports and Culture (0.6%); Environmental Protection (0.4); Science and Technology (0.1%). The disaggregation according to group of child rights shows that 63.9% of the resources contributed to the right to development, 26.3% to survival, 9.2% to protection, and 0.6% of participation.

A critical lesson is the need to enhance the digital inclusion work and expand the virtual platforms established in 2020, amplifying the programme reach and diminishing the digital gaps to ensure that all children and adolescents have internet connection and access to a device. Additionally, the office will further invest in the development and emergency nexus to strengthen the adaptability of UNICEF programmes and operations. 
"
LACR,Cuba,Lessons Learned and Innovations," The social distancing and isolation imposed by COVID 19 evidenced the potential of online platforms to achieve the expected results (psycho-emotional support through WhatsApp, online workshops for capacity building, digital mechanisms to receive feedback from affected populations, etc.). In the Cuban context, this was a major challenge due the connection issues as well derived of need of the connectivity infrastructure in the country as well the political issue that limited the access to online services.  The use of these tools must be perfected and systematized in the future nevertheless, the capacity of the team to stablish a good system support and to use it optimally, is a great lesson during 2020

In the context of COVID-19, the programmatic component achieved results, changed the implementation scheme of the development Programme interventions towards the humanitarian response, in an articulated and synergic way. It opted for the combination of various intervention strategies such as situation analysis of children and their families, dialogue, advocacy for policy support, protocols, tools, supplies and basic and essential inputs, which contribute to strengthening national capacities in the comprehensive health care of pregnant women, children and adolescents.

Earmarked funds were implemented by modifying the operational strategy and the target of 100% implementation by the end of the year was met. 100% of the reports to donors were presented on time, providing details of actions and impact through testimonies and life stories of families, mothers and communities that participated in projects promoted with the cooperation of UNICEF.

COVID 19 encouraged experimentation with new ways of implementing the Programme, aligned with the reimagine strategy of doing business, thus linking the objectives of the regular Work Plan to the response to a health emergency. The fulfilment of milestone in the regular Programme in spite of the pandemic, was possible because of the design of the CPD that already contained scenarios of emergency, including health disasters. Recognizing that during the CPD's design never consider the magnitude of the pandemic, the CO managed properly the emergency using technology and innovative approaches. 

 For example, despite not being able to carry out the planned face-to-face training sessions including the need to improve better connectivity, the effectiveness of the scope of results was achieved  promoting  interaction and direct feedback with families and teachers social networks as WhatsApp groups that were created and continue to function in terms of educational and socio-emotional care as part of inclusive education in times of pandemic (+240 families reached). Due to the effectiveness of this channel of communication, it will be developed beyond the situation of COVID-19.

 Similarly, the need for the design and implementation of online strategies for RCCE and AAP, such as the Plan for Supporting School Reopening, became evident. This included 3 Facebook Live, 4 photo essays, 2 life stories, 16 activations for social networks, 2 computer graphics, among others, with an estimated reach of over 1.7 million people. 

The importance of building strategies based on evidence and adolescent participation and empowerment in trade schools was also noted as a key strategy in the Cuban context. Through an initial diagnosis with more than 160 people involved, Communication for Development actions were designed which, due to the effectiveness of the initial diagnosis, have a greater scope and validation by the affected populations.
 More virtual learning should be implemented to prepare media throughout the country with skills to become advocates trained and equipped to deliver integrated and strategic advocacy and to seize greater knowledge and confidence in reporting, also meaning a cost-effective intervention. 

Cuba's specific context has proven it is paramount to identify journalists of different media that could become UNICEF's partners to ensure proper, knowledgeable and timely coverage of priorities derived from the cooperation program.

Another important development was the bilateral coordination with UN agencies for common procurement to reduce the burden on businesses and processes. In this regard, in collaboration with UNDP, transaction cost savings were achieved through joint procurement of vehicles, mobile phones and PPE
"
LACR,Dominican Republic,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"STAFF
In order to respond effectively to the pandemic and continue with the maximum possible number of CPD activities, a healthy and emotionally stable team was needed, as well as adequate technological tools and that these tools were well-managed by the staff. Therefore, the CO invested in the care of staff and in their psycho-emotional well-being. For this, weekly all-staff meetings were held (in which the situation of the pandemic in the country was updated, and in which each staff member was free to comment on how they were adapting to the new situation, several well-being seminars were held, including one on the topic of personal finances. Protection against COVID -19 measures were offered to the staff. Under the leadership of the Resident Coordination office, protocols were designed and implemented for cases of illness or suspicion of it. Considering the rapidly increasing workload of the staff, mitigation measures were established such as one non-cumulative day off every 15 days, and additional consultants were hired to reinforce some areas. Previous preparation, including a teleworking simulation exercise to test the business continuity plan (BCP), and additional training on IT tools during the pandemic also helped to ease the transition period.
FUNDS
In order to respond to the pandemic, additional resources were needed. UNICEF took advantage of the already good standing of the UNICEF brand and worked hard to become the leading voice on how to protect children and families from the effects of COVID-19 and to communicate about UNICEF response to the pandemic. This facilitated the strengthening of alliances with the private sector, and jointly with UNICEF´s rapid adaptation to the new situation, opened new opportunities for fundraising. As a result, a significant amount of public and private resources was mobilized. The programme budget grew by 25.4% compared to 2019 and by 87.2% compared to 2018.
DATA
It was necessary to have data on the effects of COVID-19 on children to facilitate and improve the most appropriate program response. For this reason, UNICEF and other UN agencies implemented the SEIA, already referred to, to obtain updated information about the situation of the poorest families. This information was, throughout the period of the emergency, the main source of data for decision-makers, and for UNICEF. The SEIA highlighted the magnitude and impact that the closure of prenatal care services was having and provided UNICEF with the tools to advocate for a speedy reopening. In the same way, the information obtained on the decrease in access to food for families, justified the creation of a National Plan for the Reduction of Acute Malnutrition among Children under 5 and Pregnant Women. In terms of education, the information on how children were studying from home between March and June, provided the tools to enable the MoE to create the programme “We learn at home”, with technical support from UNICEF. The results of the latest round SEIA will allow UNICEF to strengthen UNICEF advocacy in the design of the protocol for the reopening of schools. This is one of the lessons learned which was highlighted by the Real-Time Assessment (RTA) of UNICEF's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
COVID RESPONSE BASED ON PREVIOS WORK
One of the lessons learned from the UNICEF´s support, during the COVID-19 pandemic response, to the adaptive social protection, for the vertical and horizontal expansion of the regular cash transfer programme,  and the additionally support of UNICFEF with a complementary and temporary targeted expansion of the cash transfers  to 2,700 families with children with disabilities, was that, this support would not have been successful if it had not been based on the previous work of UNICEF, together with other UN agencies, in strengthening the shock responsive social protection programmes. This is one of the lessons learned highlighted by the Real-Time Assessment (RTA) of UNICEF's response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Dominican Republic: “Support for an adaptive social protection strategy has demonstrated relevance, effectiveness and potential for extension to other vulnerable groups and eventual replication in other countries of the region"".
SOCIAL MOBILIZATION 
UNICEF learned several lessons from its experience related to CMEU prevention, the first was that social mobilization must be an integral part of UNICEF strategies in order to achieve important legislative, political, programmatic and social changes, and that this can take a long time. The second, that to achieve this social mobilization, it is essential to have tools and studies carried out in the country to be able to implement local evidence-based political advocacy, which can be maintained despite changes of Governments. Third, that it is necessary to communicate this important local evidence in the media and in social networks in an innovative and poignant manner, with communication campaigns that reach the entire population. Fourth, that it is also important to be proactive with the media by arranging interviews and, at the same time, to try to be available for news outlets when they need UNICEF as a source of information or for an opinion, and that this requires having enough capabilities, a good communications team and trained spokespersons. 
INNOVATION
In terms of innovation, it is necessary to highlight the advances of UNICEF in T4D (Technology for Development) through the design of an innovative App NutreMUAC. This App facilitates the registration of cases of acute malnutrition, their monitoring and guides the decision-making by local providers according to each case. NutreMUAC can also be used by supervisors for real-time oversight of the protocol compliance of each one of the health providers and provide statistical data. 
Another innovation was the Real Time Assessment of UNICEF's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, whose observations and especially their recommendations (received in January 2021) will be implemented in the response to the pandemic during 2021 and in their interaction with the regular CPD programme.

"
LACR,Ecuador,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"2020 was a unique year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It forced UNICEF Ecuador staff to work remotely, to learn to communicate using different tools and means. It put to test the office ability to adapt, respond and deliver to a new type of crisis, while responding to two other crisis: the economy slowdown as well as the Venezuelan migration crisis. Thanks to a strong resource mobilization strategy, UNICEF Ecuador implemented more than USD $16,000.000 (a bit more than half of its approved ceiling for a four year country programme), which allowed Ecuador CO to reach the most vulnerable children, adolescents and their families with needed resources. UNICEF Ecuador was able to deliver because highly committed staff, UN Volunteers, Consultants and Individual Contractors. There was a lot of pressure to deliver on the  team, as it meant long hours for Programme and Operations staff and a strong commitment to the PFP team to raise funds in an extremely difficult context. The team was supported by management in terms of caring for psychosocial needs, wellbeing and appropriate equipment to work remotely.  Caring for the team no doubt contributed to the achievement of results for children. 
 
Innovative Initiatives:
 
Since August 2020, and thanks to the support provided by the NYHQ, UNICEF Ecuador has the technical assistance of a third-party monitoring organization (TPMO) for its cash-based intervention. After cash disbursements to participant families take place, two telephone surveys are implemented by the TPMO to determine the situation of the families, especially children and adolescents. With this information a dashboard is being developed to show the results of the cashed-based intervention.  This instrument is expected to be ready in the first quarter of 2021.
 
In order to monitor the possible excess of deaths of children due to the COVID 19 pandemic, an MoU with the National Civil Registry was signed in order to access information of deaths registered. The analysis is jointly conducted with researchers from Universidad de Cuenca. So far, there is no apparent increase in the number of deaths of children and adolescents according to the information available.   
 
 In the communication and advocacy front, UNICEF Ecuador rapidly adapted its communication strategy to respond to the pandemic emergency and maximized its products with a 360 degree approach, working closely with the fundraising team to ensure content contributed to lead generation and nurturing strategy. An example of success is the Stories to calm down package, which reached 4 million people, more than 60,000 individual donors, and was downloaded more than 20,000 times  from the website, generated 3.8% of engagement and more than 100,000 leads, 760 new donors, and 31 donations from the website. The communication and PFP teams also ensured to measure the reactions and relevance of the content. 
 
In 2020, UNICEF Ecuador also started working on its Youth Engagement strategy and boost youth initiatives such as Dream Lab, U-Report, U-Report Uniendo Voces, Internet of Good Things, and activism on climate change. A TikTok account was launched to reach adolescents and young people, obtaining more than 1 million views. In addition, as part of the “Now that you see it, say no more” campaign (EndViolence), UNICEF Ecuador developed a new phase to prevent sexual abuse between peers. The argument, formats, look and feel of the campaign were built based on young peoples’ needs, concerns, and preferences. More than 300 adolescents participated in the process. The objective is to consolidate a network of young people, reinforce their participation through tools, such as U-Report and amplify their voices.

"
LACR,El Salvador,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Beginning March 2020, COVID-19 drove response priorities  and shaped Government, UN, and CO programmes in support of affected  populations' health, socio-economic, and educational needs, also shaping response  to tropical storms in late May/early June with all actors responding to an  emergency within an emergency. UNICEF-led Education and WASH clusters galvanized  emergency response, providing fora to promote whole-of-society coordination. Continued  advocacy for education and WASH to become sectorial commissions within the  National Civil Protection System is recommended.  
  
While social-distancing thwarted collection of quality-disaggregated data on  children to inform interventions, the CO reduced information gaps by  contributing to the design of innovative digital instruments, including UNICEF's  Regional Rapid Assessment, a module for CID-Gallup's OMNIBUS and KoBos  surveys for real-time data collection for designing WASH, Health and  Nutrition interventions. 
  
To enable children to express themselves and influence decision-making, the  CO together with FLACSO, facilitated their active participation creating a  mobile platform ""Con el cel te lo digo"" to capture and  disseminate their views regarding remote education and issues concerning children. 
  
In a country prone to natural disasters, vulnerable to pandemics, designing  strategies and interventions based on global and regional evidence is  essential to advocate for the continuity of services for children. The CO  formulated evidence-based social investment proposals to mitigate the  socioeconomic effects of COVID-19 which, were considered and adopted by the  Government. Despite reprioritizations, the Government benefited from UNICEF's  evidence, for example, in designing the fiscal strategy to implement the ECD  policy ""Crecer Juntos"". The CO successfully reframed its ECD  rationale and advocacy that resonated with and was adopted by both Government  and private sector for reopening the economy with a child-friendly approach,  including through the strengthening and reopening of ECD services. The CO  with partners, elaborated an innovative Multidimensional Microsimulation Modelling  tool that contributes to designing public policies to address COVID-19 effects  of on child poverty.
  
The CO continued working locally designing intervention models to be adopted  by Government and civil society capable of being scaled nationally. The CO  adapted models and methodologies to distance modalities to increase coverage  and reach the most vulnerable children: the ""Soy Musica""  methodology developed to promote peaceful coexistence proved effective managing  stress and negative emotions, and was adapted for broadcasting on educational  television. Use of new technologies for training and communication for  development, and to maintained interaction with partners and communities,  proved essential to continue strengthening institutions and community  leadership. The CO purchased IT equipment that enabled participation of ISNA  personnel in trainings and provided the Integral Rehabilitation Centre  (CRINA) with ICT equipment to continue rehabilitation services for children  with disabilities. 
   
Adapting programmes to social distancing requires high organizational  flexibility within and amongst UNICEF, donors and partner institutions. 
  
The CO designed innovative interventions, including C4D methodologies to  promote behavioural changes to improve hygiene practices and prevent violence  against children, adapted to prevent COVID-19 transmission and gender-based  violence (GBV). Experience in promoting positive child-rearing practices (Tambien  soy Persona) supported families and partners, improving inter-generational  dialogue amongst family members during lockdown. C4D messages disseminated  through social networks and partners reached the most vulnerable families.  Peer-to-peer methodologies proved successful in building trust and empathy  when addressing vulnerable populations, including returned migrants. 
  
The CO adapted to the evolving context to deliver timely and relevant  assistance to children, families and frontline workers, facilitating the  coordination with Government, NGOs and cooperation through Humanitarian  Country Team (HCT) clusters. The HCT promoted synergies and coordination in  the design of multisectoral response plans with local actors, crucial to  building sustainability and accountability. The involvement of NGOs (i.e.  Save the Children, the Passionist Service and CIDEP) and community leaders'  empowerment, facilitated the implementation of emergency actions, adding value  to the services provided.
  
Prolonged effects of the health crisis and tropical storms  threaten to impact children the hardest. As the situation continues to  unfold, the CO prepares to address children's escalating needs (health,  increase in migration flows, interruption of essential services and growing  poverty and inequality). Bolstered connections between humanitarian and  development work are essential, while CO must increase presence within  communities to strengthen monitoring and accountability. 
  
Effects on the mental health of this crisis are still largely unknown. The  CO’s experience in psychosocial support to reintegrate child migrants and  students in the school system proved instrumental to lead the HCT response  through HCT clusters. The criticality of emphasizing this component in  education, protection and health interventions during its next CPD is  stressed.
  
Given the rise in adolescent pregnancies, reinforced coordination between the  Ministry of Health and the Adolescent Alliance is critical to strengthen  adolescent-friendly health services and, to prevent HIV/STD. 
  
The rollout of the MINEDUCYT's Early Warning  Mechanism for the Prevention of School Desertion becomes vital for  monitoring cases of school desertion and obtaining evidence to define and  revise policies and programmes. 
  
During 2020, essential components of the Child Protection System, including  helplines and claim mechanisms, proved effective in providing distance  counselling and psychosocial support. It is essential to widely disseminate  information on how to access these services and systematize data gathered by  these mechanisms to analyse trends. 
  
The returned migrant  population is not concentrated in a specific area of the country, therefore the  expansion of the model to reintegrate returned child migrants and families to  rural areas, especially in the north and west of the country, is necessary.  The CO insisted on the need of specialized attention for displaced children  and returnees including school reintegration, pediatric care, and/or the  generation of alternative life plans to migration.
  
The CO considers climate change adaptation as a multisectoral intervention to  be refined with the finalization of the CLAC and elaboration of a risk  analysis during 2021. 
  
Robust monitoring and evaluation evidence-based frameworks rooted in the  quantitative and qualitative research are also essential to foster the  institutionalization and scalability of interventions and improve emergency  response actions.
  
The CO will adjust  programmes, interventions and models based on the best practices and lessons  learned identified, also to contribute to scale up and sustainability.

LACR,Guatemala,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"El 2019, UNICEF resaltó lecciones aprendidas con relación a la comunicación y la incidencia; normas sociales; mayor coordinación con cooperantes; y un mejor enfoque de la inversión. El 2020, UNICEF reforzó las relaciones iniciadas con la nueva administración política; profundizó investigaciones sobre normas sociales y abrió una nueva línea de investigación antropológica sobre dieta, cultura y nutrición. También se acercó aún más a los donantes con presencia en el país; hizo un esfuerzo para concentrar la inversión catalítica con enfoque en programas nacionales buscando mayor probabilidad de escalar la oferta de servicios esenciales para la infancia. 
 
Concluido el 2020, el sexto y penúltimo año del ciclo de cooperación, se destacan tres grandes lecciones aprendidas: 
 
Brecha digital: El auge del mundo digital durante la pandemia con servicios a distancia tiene la posibilidad de cerrar brechas entre los que tienen y los que no tienen acceso a servicios, o bien puede marcar aún más las inequidades. Una oferta virtual de capacitación puede alcanzar más alumnos que una oferta presencial, pero no todos tienen la misma capacidad de apropiación de los contenidos ni de compra y mantenimiento de dispositivos. De igual forma, una sesión virtual para prestar apoyo psicosocial a la niñez vulnerable no puede tener el mismo resultado que una sesión presencial. UNICEF tiene como reto apalancar el uso de tecnologías, junto al Gobierno y el sector privado, de forma que cierren la brecha digital. UNICEF se plantea el desafío de trabajar aún más en soluciones digitales e innovadoras para diseñar sistemas de información y captación de datos en tiempo real que pueden acelerar una mejora sustancial en planificación, presupuestación y prestación de servicios para la niñez.    
 
Emergencias y capacidad de respuesta: Guatemala es uno de los países más vulnerables a desastres naturales en el mundo. Con tres emergencias (COVID-19, huracanes, y la movilidad humana), el 2020 dejó de relieve la necesidad de enfocar e invertir más en capacidades internas y nacionales para una respuesta oportuna ante desastres y emergencias, y trabajar más en la resiliencia de los sistemas que deben proteger a la niñez. Para el 2021, UNICEF contará con recurso humano especializado en respuesta humanitaria para planificar e incluir en su nuevo Programa de Cooperación del 2022-2025 resultados específicos, fondos y recurso humano para la preparación y respuesta humanitaria.   
 
Escala: Algunas de las intervenciones de UNICEF se han establecido y crecido de forma sistemática y estable, pero con limitada proyección. Ha llegado el momento de proyectar la escala a nivel nacional a través del Gobierno e instituciones del Estado. 
 
UNICEF siempre ha intentado llegar a escala y asegurar la sostenibilidad de intervenciones, como, por ejemplo, un gradual traslado de costos a los Ministerios. Sin embargo, la corta duración de los Gobiernos en Guatemala (cuatro años sin opción de reelección); la relativa volatilidad en permanencia de puestos clave; la débil aplicación de la ley de servicio civil; y la tendencia hacia enfoques asistencialistas más que de transformación, han constituido retos para anclar y potenciar la cooperación de UNICEF.  
 
Al concluir el 2020, habiendo acompañado a Guatemala durante un año sumamente difícil, UNICEF está bien posicionado para apoyar las instituciones guatemaltecas para escalar programas críticos para la niñez.

UNICEF, junto con el Banco Mundial, logró un aporte sustantivo en sólo tres meses para la implementación del Bono Familia, un programa sin precedentes en los programas de protección social del país, para la atención de las personas afectadas económicamente por el COVID-19. El Bono Familia se constituyó en tres aportes entregados a más de 2,600,000 familias beneficiarias de los 340 municipios del país. Además, favoreció alianzas de amplia magnitud entre el sector público, bancario, financiero, telecomunicaciones, energía eléctrica, gobiernos locales y cooperación internacional, entre otros, para el desarrollo de un mecanismo de protección social que ha llegado al 80% de los hogares guatemaltecos en condiciones de mayor vulnerabilidad, y que también está contribuyendo a la dinamización de la economía local y nacional. 
 
Se considera que la experiencia de UNICEF en materia de desarrollo de sistemas de información y de mejoras de gestión interna que han favorecido el acompañamiento a la implementación del Bono Familia serán catalíticas para la consolidación del Registro Social de Hogares y la consolidación del sistema de protección social en Guatemala. 
 
 
Además, durante la pandemia se abrieron nuevas oficinas municipales de protección a la niñez y se logró institucionalizar PRIMERO, un programa innovador de UNICEF de registro y gestión de casos a nivel global, que en Guatemala se adaptó para el seguimiento de casos de niñez no acompañada retornada de EEUU y México, el que fue muy útil para lograr reunificaciones familiares y el seguimiento de casos a nivel comunitario.  
 
Hacia 2021 
 
Para el 2021, UNICEF incorporará en su planificación y programación estas lecciones aprendidas y buscará escala a las innovaciones. 

Un informe preliminar de una evaluación multipaís (México y el triángulo norte) sobre intervenciones en materia de migración destaca que Guatemala tiene una oportunidad para afinar sus estrategias y productos para mejorar su apoyo hacia la protección de la niñez migrante. Estos hallazgos preliminares serán un insumo importante para la definición de los productos y estrategias relacionados con la niñez migrante en el outcome de protección para el 2021 y el próximo CPD.
 
La promulgación del Acuerdo Gubernativo para convertir los Centros Comunitarios de Desarrollo Infantil Temprano a Centros de Desarrollo Infantil Integral, que establece la coordinación multisectorial para la atención de niñez menor de cinco años, ayudará a escalar estos centros a nivel nacional. 
 
Durante el 2021, UNICEF buscará fondos y socios financieros para contar con personal dedicado a la respuesta humanitaria, así como más inversión catalítica en agua, saneamiento, higiene y salud. 
 
UNICEF trabajará aún más para fortalecer sistemas, incluyendo el sistema de salud, y dentro de éste, la vacunación para el COVID-19, donde UNICEF tiene una ventaja colaborativa en Comunicación para el Desarrollo y soluciones digitales. Para mayor impacto, se buscará mayor convergencia geográfica y programática para estimular una gestión local integrada por la infancia.

LACR,Guyana,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"As UNICEF approaches the end of its Country Programme, its theory of change continues to drive progress towards results for children, with opportunities to accelerate results emerging from long-term engagement with government partners and multisectoral integration. Challenges include the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the lack of use of evidence for planning and budgeting among government and implementing partners. Below are some key lessons learnt and innovations. Lessons Learnt: o   Ensuring community of services for children during general elections: Both Guyana and Suriname had general elections and there was transition of the Government, however  UNICEF Office maintained close coordination with technical staff to ensure the continuity of services to children despite election campaigning and delays in the declaration of election result in Guyana.o   Advocacy for child-centred agenda with new Governments in Guyana and Suriname: 2020 provided an opportunity to Advocate for child-centered agenda with the new Governments both in Guyana and Suriname. Series of high-level courtesy calls and advocacy meetings with several ministers including the First Ladies and the Speaker of the Parliament took place. The advocacy issues covered were public finance for children, ECD, violence against children, Youth empowerment and shock responsive social protection. In both countries, the World Children’s Day was used to advocate and to communicate UNICEF’s 6-point actions to reimagine and building back a better future for children. UNICEF also conducted media campaigns, issued press releases with partners and other UN agencies. Both Presidents of Guyana and Suriname interacted with youth and children during World Children’s Day. o   Risk Informed Planning and Programming in response to the COVID-19 pandemic: During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on both Guyana and Suriname requiring immediate shifts in programme focus towards emergency response.  While the whole population of both countries were affected, UNICEF prioritized the most vulnerable. In line with risk informed planning,  activities and budgets were analyzed and prioritization was done based on different scenarios i) Maintain: Pursuit of the programme without any change,  ii) Suspend: Temporarily suspension of the programme , iii) Modify: Adjustment of the programme based on mitigation measure and iv) Scale up: accelerate save lives activities. This allowed the team to immediately reprogramme and reallocate about $US150,000 of the budget in both countries to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in an effective manner to maximize resources for better results. o   Importance of Technical Expertise for Continued Resource Mobilization as an enabler for results during emergencies:  COVID-19 presented lots of challenges for planning and resources mobilization.  Based on its technical expertise and strong relationships, UNICEF office mobilized an annual budget of US$ 5.6 million in 2020 against the plan of US$ 3,4 million. UNICEF Guyana was able to mobilize US$ 3.570,00 from GPE as Coordinating Agency and, as result of strong technical support, facilitated the development and finalization of the Education Plan 2020-2024- Vision 2030 for Guyana. The increasing amounts of OR coming from donors in Guyana and Suriname mean that this is a growing vital asset of the country programme.Innovations: Accountability to the Affected Population (AAP) for Monitoring of Results in Emergency:  In 2020, UNICEF Guyana and Suriname consolidated its technology for development (T4D) portfolio across programmes to map the most deprived communities for interventions. The country Office developed protocols for data collection and analysis in emergency such as WASH-FIT, CAPI (Computer Assisted Personal Interview), ODK (Open Data Kit) platforms and RTM real-time monitoring of interventions. Such monitoring facilitates better data collection and decision making for both UNICEF development partners and government counterparts for evidence-based planning and monitoring results.  The country office also conducted several rounds of KAP  COVID-19 surveys to better understand the reactions of affected populations. o   Creative C4D and use of social media use, enhancing demand and crisis communication. For the RCCE awareness campaign, creative engagement with communities, a Facebook Chatbot was piloted as a low-cost alternative to telephone helplines for concerned parents, causing engagement to spike from a monthly average of six messages to over 100 in two weeks. Targeted message boosting increased followers of the Expanded Programme for mental health Facebook page from 4,734 (48 percent women) to over 20,000 people (52 percent women). Social media was an important arena for COVID-19 crisis communication. 428,000 in Guyana and 530,000 in Suriname were reached through messaging on COVID-19 prevention and access to services through different channels multiple times. UNICEF acted swiftly to correct misconceptions by convincing those who had disseminated original “scare-stories” to issue retractions. Similar measures were implemented for the “how do you feel” TV campaign. Interpersonal communication was critical to COVID-19 response in the hinterland. UNICEF’s equity-focused package included the establishment of helplines units to bring services to children and women in the need of assistance to prevent or respond to the GBV and VAC in emergency. This approach underpinned the success of the immediate response to the COVID-19, and UNICEF is now working with governments to sustain it so COVID-19 affected children can receive psychological treatment.o   Shock-Responsive Social Protection Safety nets for vulnerable children including migrants:   Packages of integrated interventions for the most deprived population in response to the COVID-19 yielded sustainable results. With these learnings, UNICEF supported the design of fully integrated WASH, health, nutrition, Child Protection and Education services with a strong integrated C4D component. This was piloted in 5 classified high-risk communities in Suriname and towards Venezuelan’s migrants, with promising early results. It further influenced Government and partners to prioritize integrated services as a core strategy in the high-risk and most deprived regions and districts.The office continuously monitored the implementation of evaluation management responses. An Evaluation of Infant and Young Child Feeding and Essential Care (IYFC+) Communication Strategy in Suriname was finalised in 2020.Looking ahead in 2021, UNICEF will continue to work with the governments of Guyana and Suriname to shift political will and integrate child focused interventions into government planning structures. The lessons learned from 2020 will feed into the preparation of the new Country Programme in 2021. "
LACR,Haiti,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Strengthen emergency preparedness, disaster risk reduction and the humanitarian - development nexus

Given the growing socio-political instability and the country's high vulnerability to disasters, strengthening emergency preparedness and disaster risk reduction (DRR) emphasizing the humanitarian - development nexus, including through the maintenance of contingency stocks and strengthening of sector coordination, remain key priorities. There is an acute need to prevent outbreaks of waterborne diseases and to better prepare for climate-related emergencies through awareness raising on handwashing, and concrete disaster preparedness actions with vulnerable communities. National authorities and the humanitarian community are closely monitoring the situation and maintaining DRR and preparedness activities, while planning for the COVID-19 vaccine campaign in 2021. A key lessons learned from the cholera and more recently from COVID-19, was the role of prevention and response to outbreaks through a strong engagement of the WASH sector.
 
In line with the recommendations of the 2019 Climate Landscape Analysis for Children (CLAC) study, climate change adaptation activities are being strengthened in all programmes. UNICEF is also exploring climate change adaptation partnerships opportunities with other UN agencies including UNEP and FAO. An evaluation of UNICEF’s work initiatives on cash transfers is ongoing to further guide programming on cash and vouchers.
 
Supply

Given Haiti’s high vulnerability to disasters, strengthening the supply chain to procure lifesaving emergency items remains a key strength and a priority for UNICEF to meet regular requests from Government and partners. While local markets are weak and dependent on imported goods, UNICEF remains committed to engaging with suppliers to meet the current and future needs of children. In response to COVID-19, UNICEF successfully established a responsive supply chain to meet emerging needs such as critical hygiene and prevention items, including soap and buckets for hands washing, drinking water dispensers, disinfectant, and personal protection equipment. UNICEF has a 2,000 square meters warehouse which provides efficient and effective support. Over 900 potential suppliers have been identified for critical goods, and long terms arrangements have been put in place for both products and services to facilitate day to day operations. 
 
Responding to Violence against women and children
 
Given the prevalence of various forms of violence in Haiti, UNICEF will invest further in favor of the elimination of violence against children including through improving parental education and addressing family violence. The launch of the EU Spotlight Initiative in 2020 allowed UNICEF to work on these issues. U-Report was an essential tool particularly during COVID-19 when the possibility of in person information gathering was limited. A U-Report survey highlighted the prevalence of domestic violence[1] and the need to strengthen parental education to reduce violent discipline[2]. 

To improve reporting of incidents and assistance to children in need, UNICEF supported IBESR to reactivate their free hotline which will work alongside the helpline of the Brigade for the Protection of Minors of the Haitian National Police. The existence of helplines helped ensure community access to information and assistance throughout periods of service interruptions. Making use of available technology (U-Report and helplines) helped ensure a continuation of services amidst the pandemic.  

In 2021, UNICEF will maintain its advocacy efforts for the adoption of the child protection code in-line with the 2016 recommendation from the Committee on the Rights of the Child to reinforce the protective environment for children. 

Reflect further on Youth

Working under the Generation Unlimited (GenU) initiative which brings together the United Nations, governments and the private sector, UNICEF Haiti has been strengthening its outreach towards adolescents and young people. 

In 2020, UNICEF partnered with NGOs like Sakala and IDEJEN to engage youths in the fight against COVID-19. 600 youths were trained on how to communicate on barrier gestures and they informed 300,000 people on handwashing, mask wearing and physical distancing. and distributed 12,000 masks and face covers in the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince and on its outskirts with difficult access such as Cite Soleil.

To better understand, young people’s opinions on issue affecting their lives, 23 U-Report surveys[3] were conducted in 2020. To strengthen youth participation and community awareness UNICEF established a partnership with the National Association of Scouts of Haiti (NASH), the largest youth organization in Haiti comprising of 50,000 members, which reached out to over 11,500 individuals through community mobilizing activities promoting the use of U-Report and violence prevention.

30 adolescents and youths trained by UNICEF partner ENPAK informed 30,000 people on children’s rights thanks to a dozen videos produced and an itinerary exhibition of child paintings organized in schools. To mark world children’s day on 20 November 2020, 200 adolescents and youths advocated for the adoption of the code of child protection in front the First Lady, The Minister of Social Affairs and UNICEF Deputy Representative. 
 
More than 500 young mentors, peer educators and monitors contributed to either training children, adolescents and adults or conducted awareness sessions (door to door, public places, boombox), processed posters posting, hand washing points installation, monitoring and demonstrations in key public places.
 
The validation of the first national alternative education policy opened the way to an improved educational offer for half a million Haitian children outside the school system. A key area of focus will be to strengthen vocational training and non-formal education to improve the employability of young people. There is also a need to strengthen the involvement of the private sector (chamber of commerce) in the training and professional reintegration of adolescents.

[1] 49% of respondents believe violence against children takes place in the home, 22% at school and 29% in both the home and the school.
[2] 64% of respondents believe parental education is the best approach for reducing violent discipline.

LACR,Honduras,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Early Childhood Development
The evaluation of the programme Parenting with Love finalized in December pointed at key lessons. The scaling of the programme with full government operation and financing is still a challenge after five years of UNICEF’s support. SEDIS does not have adequate quality assurance mechanisms for extending the territorial coverage of this programme with quality; nor public budgets have been allocated that allow reaching more families with the frequency that ECD prevention and care interventions require. Although the programme has been operational since 2015, coordination between SEDIS and DINAF has not yet been achieved, compromising the sustainability and future impact of the programme. The evaluation also identified important aspects that have led to the success of the programme in the communities where it has been implemented. The production of simple materials, such as the ‘Young Hondurans Growing with Love’ guide, is viewed positively by the beneficiaries of the programme. The inclusive and visual language of this material, used as part of the counselling service, made it an effective element for promoting changes in parenting practices.  The community component of the programme was positively evaluated, specifically the involvement of volunteers, who changed their own beliefs and behaviors in relation to protection issues such as physical punishment through their participation in the programme. 
 
Quality and Inclusive Education
Public education in Honduras is managed in a centralized manner, making it difficult to deploy education in emergencies strategies in an effective manner. 2020, a year marked by emergencies and nation-wide school closures, required finding new ways to achieve education results at local level. UNICEF’s coordination of education response at local level was essential to ensure timely provision of psychosocial support and continuity of learning in the aftermath of the Eta/Iota emergency. 
 
UNICEF is now leading the education cluster, providing support to a Ministry of Education (SEDUC) that typically works through bilateral agreements, rather than playing a convening role to galvanize action from relevant education stakeholders. A lesson learned is that timely advocacy for SEDUC to activate the education cluster and other multi-lateral mechanisms such as donors’ working groups has positive effects on efficient and timely emergency response, avoiding duplication of efforts and expenses. UNICEF will continue supporting and convening coordination mechanisms and multi-stakeholder working groups in 2021.
 
In terms of innovations, a lesson learned is that given the insufficient internet coverage and the widespread poverty exacerbated by COVID-19 and the impact of the tropical storms, the free expansion of the digital learning platform must include offline tools (e.g. Learning Passport offline), and should be accompanied by in-person tutoring and distribution of printed materials. These lessons will inform the education work plan for 2021.
Protecting Children from Violence
A key lesson learned in the context of emergency response is that in order to quickly reach the most vulnerable population with child protective services, it is more effective to partner with organizations as close to the target population as possible. UNICEF was able to quickly adapt preexisting workplans with local governments, community-based organizations and the Honduran Red Cross to provide emergency protective services, temporary shelter and Mental Health and Psychosocial Support Services (MHPSS), reaching hundreds of families in some of the most vulnerable communities.
Social Inclusion
UNICEF showed its capacity to innovate and adapt to change during the humanitarian crisis caused by COVID-19 and tropical storms Eta and Iota. Strong relationships with national counterparts and existing workplans allowed emergency funds to be channelled by adapting workplans. The work being done with the municipal level has helped greatly in a context where immediate action was required. This level of government has shown great capacity to adapt to the circumstances, thanks to UNICEF-supported management capacities.
 
An important lesson learned is that the main partners of the Honduras government in the area of social inclusion are the International Financial Institutions (e.g. IDB, World Bank, IMF), and the UN agency with capacity and experience in designing cash transfer schemes is WFP. These organizations are well positioned to achieve impact for children in social inclusion, signalling the need for UNICEF to forge strategic partnerships with them in 2021, in preparation for the new CPD 2022-2026 which is in construction.
 
Emergency Response
After the complex multilayered emergencies of 2020 UNICEF emerged as a leader in Honduras, able to effectively channel humanitarian funds for children, convene relevant stakeholders including government, coordinate cluster action and monitor the emergency response in the field. UNICEF needs to continue positioning itself as a leader in emergency response, given Honduras high risk for climate-related emergencies, taking into account that children are one of the most vulnerable groups to health and climatic shocks. 
 
One lesson learned was the urgent need of strengthening sector contingency plans to address multi-hazards scenarios, mapping existing resources, key stakeholders and their capacities. Given the current COVID-19 crisis, further aggravated by the adverse effects of tropical storms ETA and IOTA. 
 
Communications
The ability of the communications area to adapt to new circumstances such as COVID-19, using community structures, the private sector, social networks, the media and volunteering to respond to the demands of children and adolescents during the pandemic was essential to effectively contribute to delivering life-saving information during emergencies, and was also important for fundraising.
One lesson learned is that strategic advocacy campaigns can make a difference for groups of children that face great exclusion and stigma. In 2020, UNICEF raised awareness on the issue of children living with HIV. The country office forged an alliance with Fundación to rollout a communication and advocacy strategy focused on the reduction of stigma and discrimination, access to health care and access to education, treatments for HIV, human rights, prevention against sexual crimes, and sexual and reproductive rights. 1,200 HIV positive children and adolescents in the context of COVID-19 were direct beneficiaries. 
 
Based on lessons learned, UNICEF Honduras will focus efforts in 2021 in scaling up emergency response with a triple nexus approach, creating linkages between humanitarian, development and peacebuilding actions, in close collaboration with the UN system and our partners in the field.

LACR,Jamaica,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"1) Better office climate for better results.

Since 2018, UNICEF Jamaica has implemented multiple training and team building activities to strengthen team spirit, raise staff morale and promote gender diversity and inclusivity among the staff, in line with UNICEF’s Care, Respect, Integrity, Trust and Accountability (CRITA) values. These deliberate efforts to create and maintain an inclusive and harmonious office climate are yielding excellent results, as shown by the 2020 Global Staff Survey. The JCO was ranked among the top three offices globally in staff satisfaction and engagement, a significant improvement over previous survey results. Efforts to strengthen staff engagement continued in 2020 with more sessions geared at improving communication and promoting UNICEF’s ‘speak up culture.’ Duty of care and flexibility also played a big role in ensuring the team was engaged and morale was kept high, especially amid prolonged working from home because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Colleagues’ mental health, amid the COVID-19 crisis, was another area on which the staff association, HR and Management joined efforts to address. Throughout the year, the JCO maintained active remote interactions with innovative ice breakers, virtual checkups and social sessions as well as brownbag lunch sessions to bolster team engagement. 

The internal reflection on the results of the Global Staff survey conducted in collaboration with the Global Principal Adviser of Organizational Culture, Regional Office (RO) HR team, the Staff Association JCO confirmed that this high level of engagement and staff satisfaction achieved by Jamaica country office was accompanied by greater programmatic results. The programme is increasingly shifting to more high-level policy dialogue and high impact results, confirming that a good office environment and a highly motivated team deliver significantly better results for children

2)  Leveraging support for children in the context of the UN Reform. 

As part of the UN reform, UNICEF Jamaica has made a deliberate effort to join forces and work together with the rest of the UN system to support the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the response to emergencies in Jamaica. In this vein, in 2020 UNICEF became one of the main UN Recipient Agencies for the European Union (EU)-funded Spotlight initiative that is supporting the Government of Jamaica’s efforts to reduce family violence. Beyond Spotlight, new joint programme opportunities provided UNICEF with a platform to broaden areas of engagement; better coordinate efforts with other UN agencies to achieve transformative and sustainable results for children; and access the new pool of funding sources made available as part of the UN Reform and SDG acceleration efforts. 

As part of the COVID-19 response, UNICEF successfully led a joint proposal for the COVID-19 Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPTF), that mobilized US$600,000 to support UNICEF and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) efforts to address the socio-economic impact of COVID on the most disadvantaged. UNICEF also led a successful joint proposal, in partnership with UNDP and PAHO, to the Joint SDG Trust Fund that mobilized US$1.2 million to support improving efficiency, effectiveness and equity in Public Expenditure in Jamaica for SDG acceleration. In partnership with UNDP a Joint Programme proposal that is currently at the final review stage, was developed to establish an Innovative Impact Investment Fund in Jamaica in partnership with the private sector. 

3) Innovative new platforms for providing mental health services to adolescents and young people 

The COVID-19 pandemic has taken its toll on the mental health of adolescents and young people, exacerbating pre-existing challenges. The limited availability of mental health services even before the pandemic made virtual engagement a priority to expand access to these services.  In line with this focus, several interventions were set in motion to provide adequate psychosocial and mental health support or referrals to adolescents and young people during the pandemic and beyond. 

As part of the emergency response, UNICEF supported CSO Eve for Life to provide safer and more consistent access to victims of violence against women and girls (VAWG) through survivor mentors, by providing cellular phones and data plans. This project provided emotional support to 100 victims of VAWG.  In the education sector, UNICEF partnered with the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health’s Child Guidance Clinics to establish a teletherapy system for children, identified through schools, who were struggling with mental health issues such as depression, suicidal thoughts and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Finally, through UNICEF’s financial support and advocacy the Ministry of Health and Wellness (MOHW) and the University of the West Indies’ (UWI) Caribbean Child Development Centre (CCDC) are collaborating to establish a mental health chatline for adolescents and youth. Powered by UNICEF’s RapidPro software and its U-Partners chatline management dashboard, the service will provide 24-hour access to messaging-based counselling and referral services. These new platforms will facilitate the access to critical services and support to adolescents and families beyond COVID-19.

4)   Accelerating implementation of Spotlight Initiative programme during COVID 19

The launch of the Spotlight Initiative (SI) in Jamaica took place in early March. However, programme implementation was severely affected by the COVID-19 restrictions, as most of the UNICEF-supported interventions are at community level. Thanks to the EU’s flexibility, UNICEF promptly reprogramed part of the 2020 funding to respond to the increase levels of family violence  as a result of COVID-19, within the framework and objectives of the programme.  
 
To accelerate implementation a call for expressions of interest was issued to identify civil society partners offering the best comparative advantage. This led to the partnership agreements with 6 CSOs, which are currently supporting the SI implementation to address family violence at community level, including positive parenting, C4D  theatre for development, GBV prevention activities in schools and through sports. 
 
Thanks to the UNICEF team’s swift response in reprogramming and identifying new partners, the JCO was able to fill key gaps to prevent and respond to the increase in family violence seen as a result of the pandemic and its impacts, while accelerating the programme delivery. Implementation of the programme reached 90 per cent by the end of the year, despite the challenging circumstances of COVID-19. 
 

"
LACR,"LACRO, Panama",Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Drawing on the unprecedented complexities and challenges posted by the Covid-19 pandemic, 2020 has brought about the following lessons learned. 
 
Several UNICEF COs that were not active in Health, became engaged when governments called on them to support the COVID-19 response (the response to the epidemic, and the mitigation of the socioeconomic impacts). This shows that UNICEF is agile and relevant in Health, including in areas where actions had been reduced. For Nutrition this happened to a lesser extent. There have been some constraints in the capacity of UNICEF in the area of health in the LAC region. Low numbers of staff for Health, Nutrition and HIV at CO and RO level are a major bottleneck for accelerating actions and responding to the demand from governments and COs respectively, including for resource mobilization. Recruitments, including for consultants, remain time consuming. In emergencies (public health or caused by natural phenomena), the role of Nutrition in general and UNICEF's role in coordination, still need more advocacy to prevent deterioration of the situation and to avoid reputational risk. The issue was put on the radar of LACRO management, GNC and HQ (PD and EMOPS) and an advocacy plan will be designed and implemented in 2021, jointly with the Global Nutrition Cluster and others.
 
On system strengthening, the lesson learned is that it is important to rebuild education systems differently not only in terms of offsetting the effects of COVID-19, but to addressing pre-existing weaknesses and gaps, and build more resilient system to possible future crisis. The digital gaps need to be closed. Lessons learned from activities undertaken showed that UNICEF has a strategic role to play to assist countries in innovations in education, including in digital education, capacity development for teachers, addressing inequities, skills development, formative assessment and monitoring as well as advocacy for reopening of schools and ECD centers while ensuring learning recuperation and preventing drop out. At the regional level, what worked well was the identification and sharing of knowledge, knowledge generation and capacity development and exchange of good practices. In ECD, UNICEF was key in responding to the needs of parents for useful, credible and relevant information to help them in providing early learning opportunities and nurturing care to their children. The early childhood services workforce required support to incorporate innovative tools and technology to ensure the continuity of services in a remote/hybrid form. COs need more KM and experience-sharing mechanisms to strengthen their work ensuring education continuity and learning outcomes.  
 
In the area of child protection, countries in the region were able to introduce new tools to improve service access in a sustainable manner, however some struggled to adapt existing services in the face of the pandemic. The regional and global studies showed that services were closed, for example border services or counselling services for family reintegration support. In some countries, rather than adjusting the modality for doing these services, new services were introduced instead, such as helplines. This is not in all cases where some countries reinforced their hotline and helpline services, and others capitalized on the opportunity to promote alternatives to detention for those in conflict with the law. This potentially indicates a difficulty in the system to adapt existing institutional structures, but also at the same time a flexibility to incorporate new tools and services. 
 
Another learning is that it was initially presumed that a health pandemic may curb the migration flows in the region. This did not happen as the circumstances, such as natural disasters, the covid related deterioration of the economy and loss of employment, along with the continuing violence in the communities, continued to provide impetus for families to move to other countries in the hope of better opportunities. Further with the lack of jobs and potentially limited access to health care, some also returned to their country of origin, changing patterns of migration. With the already existing xenophobia, the disinformation that Covid-19 is transmitted by ‘foreigners’ resulted in migrants facing increased risks of violence.
 
The pandemic illustrated the importance of effective knowledge management systems across the region to get the information quickly to inform programme implementation. Of particular importance initially was the information necessary to adjust practices to control the pandemic. Several country offices prepared specific protocols for care facilities such as for children in alternative care and in conflict with the law. It was challenging to get the required knowledge resources for the response in Spanish, and to capture in real time the programming learning. 
 
In the area of social policy, lessons learned included that quality policy work, and/or the means to build best practice, are endeavors that could use further support and the signaling that they are valued. This is a region in which “upstream” or policy work should be an aim, as strong governments and institutions exist, and as our small budgets do not allow us to implement any intervention at a significant scale. If “downstream” work is to take place, we should have strong M&E frameworks that allow for documented lessons, and rigorous evaluation that demonstrates results or allows for lesson-learning. 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic also significantly tested the ability of our established data collection methods. To support this, LACRO was able to innovate and to generate evidence on the situation of children in “real time” that remained robust and representative in nature. This involved the design and implementation of multi-sector, multi-country rapid telephone-based household survey. The survey was conducted between the period of June and July reaching 10,500 households across 13 countries in the region, covering indicators across health, education, nutrition, WASH, CP, and social inclusion. The results it generated were representative at the regional (60% of LAC’s population) and national levels (both for HH with children and HH without children). While not at the same level of representativeness, the survey also included a convenient sample of Venezuelan immigrants in Trinidad and Tobago, Peru, Colombia, and Brazil, which offered some, however non-robust, “real time” insights into this population of particular concern in our region.

"
LACR,Mexico,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Given this extraordinary year of the COVID-19 pandemic and considering its impact on the political, social and economic context of Mexico for the years to come, it is important to take into account the following lessons identified in 2020:

In the face of complexity and ambiguity of the pandemic, it was necessary to create different scenarios on how programming, operations, communication and fundraising should adapt to the context, in order to stay relevant in the country, rather than just sticking to the plan. The scenario-building gave a sense of direction to the staff, helping manage anxiety related to the uncertainty of COVID-19. It has also provided an impulse for the office to start generating savings to ensure business continuity, in case fundraising (which generates 90% of office funds) would be severely impacted by the economic crisis brought about by the pandemic. 
In 2020 the Ministry of Health focused all its efforts in the emergency response to COVID-19. Previously agreed priorities, such as strengthening nutrition services in the health system, faded in the background. However, nutrition acquired new importance in the national agenda due to the evidence relating malnutrition (especially overweight and obesity) to increased susceptibility to the new coronavirus. The ability of UNICEF Mexico to adapt its approach to new and emerging Government priorities, without losing focus on its country programme targets, was a key lesson learned.
In order to push for politically sensitive policy changes, such as the harmonization of the General Law on the Rights of Children and Adolescents with the Migration Law, it was important for UNICEF to position itself together with other UN agencies, primarily, UNHCR,  IOM and OHCHR. It resulted in a stronger and united stance of the UN on the matter, helping with the approval of non-detention, best interest determination and special protection measures for migrant children and adolescents.
To reach students excluded by the mainstream distance education programme, UNICEF proposed several innovative ideas for no-tech or low-tech solutions, including the use of the Internet of Good Things, RapidPro SMS messaging, call centres for educational support, amongst others. However, slow decision-making processes and overwhelmed capacities at the federal MoE paralyzed their actual implementation.  By the end of 2020, only the SMS messaging for parents in support of the educational continuity of their children was functioning, reaching only 20,000 parents. In the future, it is recommended to approach state authorities rather than federal ones, when it comes to piloting innovative ideas, given that their decision-making process is shorter and contact with school communities is closer.
Over the past years, UNICEF Mexico has developed several pilot projects, some of which were not scalable, despite their positive results. As a lesson learned, before starting a pilot, it is important to clarify its policy pathway and consider requirements for its scalability, such as evaluations and costing exercises. It is also paramount to link pilot interventions directly with existing Government programmes or plans, to ensure co-ownership, and in some cases co-financing, to promote their sustainability in the long-term.
INNOVATION

UNICEF Mexico innovated with a new way to perform end-user monitoring remotely that is cost-efficient and without requirement of new technologies. PFP, M&E and the Nutrition teams collaborated on monitoring the appropriate delivery of 37,000 food baskets, reaching 65,000 children in five states and learn about the opinions the beneficiaries had on the content of the baskets, by using the PFP call centre. Results showed that 18% of families who received the assistance declared that they did not have anything else to eat the day they received the donation, while 40% declared that they did not have enough to eat in general. One third of the interviewees who declared having received a leaflet with information on healthy diets, also declared that they did not remember even one key message contained in the leaflet. 
While distance learning is mostly defined by access to internet and other information and communication technologies, the pandemic served as a lesson to re-learn the use of solutions from the past to solve existing problems. For example, in some remote villages in Chiapas, neither internet-based nor television-based remote learning schemes would work as neither the internet nor television signal reach them. In this case, the support to learning during the pandemic would have been more effective with the distribution of “old school” solutions like a photocopier or paper-based material. This would have been faster, more accessible and cost-efficient than investing in sophisticated learning platforms.

LACR,Nicaragua,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Communication:
The production of communication materials in people’s own languages, representing their cultural practices, was crucial to effectively reach minority groups with behavior change messages. The alliance with Millicom-TIGO allowed for sending SMS messages about measures to prevent COVID19 in all languages spoken in Nicaragua, including Miskito and Creole and more than one million people were reached even in remote communities with limited internet access.  
The implementation of digital platforms was a great ally to collect information on attitudes and practices on different topics and carry out trainings. UNICEF held 40 Facebook live to disseminate information on child protection, promotion of homeschooling and health care for COVID19 prevention. More than 5,000 participants responded the seven surveys implemented to understand adolescents’, youths’ and adults’ risk perception on COVID19. This allowed to design more effective communication actions.
The production of firsthand communication contents showing the damages and impact of the hurricanes on the communities and the most urgent needs of affected children and families, was fundamental for advocacy and fundraising. This approach should orient UNICEF emergency preparedness and response in the future. 
Education:
The COVID19 pandemic exposed the vulnerabilities of the education system more clearly, showing the country lacks the resources to effectively respond to basic needs in education. It put in evidence that the challenges would only be overcome with the active participation of all actors of the educational community. It showed that the need to work with and fully involve parents in their children’s learning processes is evident.  It became clear that UNICEF needs to continue focusing on the most vulnerable to help with service delivery at the local level, as much as resources permit and raise additional resources to support the MoE to design a continuity plan for emergency situations.  
In the context of ETA/IOTA emergencies, UNICEF identified plenty of opportunities to collaborate with other UN agencies and civil society organization to work toward the same goals and reach children more effectively in underserved and vulnerable areas. For instance, UNICEF is playing a key role in helping coordinate humanitarian assistance in the absence of the cluster mechanism, especially within the UN system and with international NGOs.
Early child survival and development:
In the collaboration with Los Pipitos, one of the most important challenges was to ensure that children with disabilities could continue with their development processes as well as maintaining support for families without spreading COVID19.  For this, it was necessary to adapt the implementation modality of the Community-Based Inclusive Development Model, ensuring the processes of family development and empowerment without home visits by an itinerant interdisciplinary committee.  So, the itinerant team modified the methodology and prepared educational materials through videos, infographic posters, cards, audios and digital brochures that contain the therapies for each stage of treatment so they could be shared through WhatsApp with each family. They also recorded educational sessions that were later sent to families through that network.
Furthermore, the families organized themselves into two support networks and began recording and sharing videos. The families with more experience supported the “new families” in preparing their individual development plans. This allowed 281 individual plans to be prepared and 218 men were involved in raising their children. This exchange between networks helped to empower families, seek more information and strengthen knowledge and practices. The suspension of visits had a positive impact because 2,570 of 2,000 targeted attentions were guaranteed. Replacing physical visits to virtual interactions allowed all children to continue their development progress.
Innovation highlighted:
In the first weeks after ETA/IOTA hurricanes, UNICEF and GMC were able to quickly conduct an online damage assessment survey. Afterwards, UNICEF hired a British satellite georeferencing company, which helped to visualize the damages on an electronic map, showing flooded areas, population density and exact location of affected communities. This provided useful information for response planning, for  resources mobilization and promoting better articulation, coordination and harmonization. 
Based on lessons learned from its participation in the first edition of Generation Unlimited Youth Challenge, UNICEF made efforts to improve the experience of youth teams which competed in the GenU YC 2.0.  Emphasis was put on strengthening the entrepreneurship focus of projects designed by the participants. To cover this expertise need, partnerships were established and consolidated with Global Shapers, UNIDO and the Zamora Terán Foundation, especially in providing facilitators, mentors and juries for the GenU YC 2.0. They also accompanied the incubation phase of the four national finalist teams. This technical support was essential to create the conditions that allowed Hydrolution’s, one of the Nicaraguan teams, to become a global GenU Youth Challenge Champion.  Hydrolution’s project consists in recycling used cooking oil to produce soaps and includes a whole component to promote innovation and entrepreneurship in rural communities. As a GenU global champion, the team will receive additional financial and technical support in 2021. 
Regarding open innovation, a hackathon was organized in the framework of UNICEF response to the COVID19 pandemic. During a 24-hour online design sprint, 28 adolescents and young people, organized in ten teams, formulated innovative ideas to tackle issues related to the impact of the pandemic. A jury selected the two most promising ideas which received UNICEF support to develop their projects further.
It is also worth mentioning that UNICEF supported the SINAPRED to train more than 1,000 members of emergency municipal brigades in charge of protecting civilians during emergencies.  The training strengthened their capacities to lead evacuation efforts and proved to be very effective in responding to hurricanes Eta and Iota.  Despite the destruction power of the hurricanes, only a small number of human lives were lost.

"
LACR,Panama,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"1. PCO designed a flexible Covid-19 Response Plan to align its interventions to the new context.
The health, social and economic crisis caused by the pandemic required to redefine and adapt UNICEF’s work plan in all programmatic areas. The new context dictated the priority lines that needed to be developed during 2020. Accordingly, UNICEF designed a Covid-19 Response Plan which was adapted continuously to ensure interventions were aligned to the situation. As an example, we learned new ways to respond to violence and to inform the State about good practices. 
As a country office in a HIC, we are compelled to respond to emergencies and adapt our work to different situations, which requires emergency, logistics and supplies expertise, field workers and specialists, transport, emergency IPs, and an increased budget. Having a multidisciplinary and flexible approach to the implementation of the country program, addressing different situations that may arise during the cooperation cycle was crucial in this novel emergency context.
2. Implications of the High-Income Country (HIC) classification for UNICEF´s cooperation program.
Under the World Bank definition, Panama entered the list of HIC in 2018.  However, there are different approaches used by UN agencies on Panama classification, some still consider Panama an UMIC (using an innovative approach of resource allocation which adjust GNI per capita for health inequality). Given the importance of leaving no one behind, it is critical that a clear approach for HIC programming considers social and economic inequalities and the needs of children beyond income per capita. The use of the current income-based World Bank classification could have negative implications for promoting an agenda for children in one of the most unequal countries in the region, also threatening the access to resources for UNICEF in Panamá. Under the current circumstances, the organization’s own investment for the PSFR in Panama would be critical to guarantee the sustainability of the country program.  
3. Evidence is key for driving results and winning support for children. 
2020 was marked by the need to generate evidence about the situation of families during the Covid-19 emergency. PCO continued to be a rigorous evidence generator and a relentless advocate for children´s rights during the pandemic. PCO conducted two rapid assessments and used the results to inform, guide and adapt interventions from the government and the UN. 
2020 was also the last year of PCO’s current cooperation cycle.  Planning for the next cycle was grounded on identified priorities to ensure impact at scale. The process of developing the new CPD was accompanied by a capacity building program in data savviness. This “teach and do” approach allowed the PCO to strengthen its overall capacity and proficiency in evidence-informed and results-based program planning.  The team increased their awareness on the importance of good evidence-based causal analysis to set a solid foundation for developing theories of change and strategies, resulting in the preparation of solid evidence-based Program Strategy Notes (PSNs) and CPD. Involving the entire CO from the beginning contributed to the joint nature of this endeavor and its appropriation.
4. Upstream policy work must be combined with local interventions to realize the full potential of children’s rights. 
Given the highly centralized structure of Panamanian institutions, upstream policy work is a necessary dimension of UNICEFs cooperation. However, the high levels of inequality that define social relationships in rural and indigenous territories compel us to refocus attention on sub-national programming. The provision of technical assistance on key policy issues combined with downstream work, where interventions directly impact the lives of vulnerable communities, proved effective in accelerating results for children. 
5. UN reform demands a significant investment of time and resources that need to be balanced against the country office institutional and programmatic priorities.
UNICEF fully participates in the UN reform process and influences the UNSDCF to position children’s issues through its capacity to provide significant communication and rigorous monitoring. UNICEF regularly leads and takes part in multi-agency interventions, ensuring children’s rights are considered in the UN cooperation framework. However, the demand from the UN coordination office at country level increased significantly in 2020. PCO invested time and human resources to articulate efforts with the Coordination Office and other UN agencies for topics such as UNSDCF, SERP, management of the Covid-19 crisis, security issues, etc. It is important to balance demands and pay special attention to the increased workload as this may affect performance of the CO team.
6. Innovative joint efforts between PFP, Communications and Program sections were key to develop quick responses that position an agenda for children in the context of Covid-19 pandemic, highlighting the impact on children's safety and wellbeing. Internal cross sectoral collaboration enabled the team to provide a coherent response and high-quality technical support to governmental counterparts and implementing partners. Inter-sectoral collaboration helped the CO to position advocacy messages with decision makers, academia, the private sector, NGOs and the public, and was crucial to harness the power of business and to influence the media culture. 
"
LACR,Paraguay,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The COVID-19 pandemic evidenced the structural weaknesses that country still faces in several areas, including health, education and protection services. UNICEF reprogrammed key activities and reoriented financial resources to support government institutions and CSOs in their response to the pandemic, specially to guarantee continuity of basic maternal and child health, education and social services. The rapid flexibilization of rules and procedures by the organization were very helpful in engaging in the response early on, under unprecedented conditions.
Online formats and the COVID-19 safety measures initially hindered access to field work, including monitoring and measuring of the impact of the training activities. An accelerated process to change and adapt work modalities to online platforms and virtual activities was a major lesson learned for the CO. Training activities such as the inclusive education and universal learning design (DUA), the @maestrosconectados, and the maternal and child health modules for health care professionals, as well as monitoring processes of field activities, shifted to online formats. Despite those challenges, a survey conducted among teachers participating in the online training modules showed that online training was well accepted by(around 95% of participants indicated satisfaction with the course). Similarly, health care professionals also expressed satisfaction with online training.
UNICEF also worked with community-based organizations with proven fieldwork access and experience. Existing community-based networks and organizations such as the Network of Informal Urban Settlements facilitated contact and reach to families, while work with community-based networks such as Techo and Habitat facilitated work with adolescents. Work with these organizations with capacity to promote community participation spaces and work with adolescents in prevention and protection against violence will be key to the CO´s work in 2021 on adolescent engagement.
Sustained advocacy and support to government institutions to advance the ECD agenda paid off, despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Key government stakeholders and CSO partners continued to show strong commitment and political willingness to support ECD, including the launch of the ECD National Strategy with participation of the President and other government authorities, and the integration of ECD-related components in the roll out of the new Social Protection System VAMOS. However, the challenge of effective collaboration and coordination among social services institutions persists and it should be further addressed. For example, UNICEF´s technical support to facilitate coordination and collaboration mechanisms between the institutions leading the implementation of the National ECD Strategy and their articulation with the Health and Education sectors- was very strategic. 
With support from UNICEF and the International Labor Organization (ILO), a Technical Coordination Committee of VAMOS was established to foster a participatory process for the roll out of the program. This example of interagency coordination provided important lessons that could strengthen UNICEF´s role in the Joint Working Program – UNSDCF and lead to new cost-effective coordination opportunities at local level to maximize impact of interventions as well as their sustainability.
Proactive engagement of stakeholders in key initiatives and programs remains a key lesson learned, especially with regards to sensitive issues. For example, the National Plan for Children and Adolescents, developed with UNICEF support, was strongly questioned by some social actors, mainly due to misunderstandings regarding concepts such as gender equality and inclusion. Following a series of public debates, the MINNA agreed to implement a new series of workshops and public forums to address key questions raised about the gender-equality approach of the Plan and eventually achieve its approval. The UNICEF CO will continue to provide technical support to ensure the promotion and fulfillment of adolescents and children’s rights in line with the country´s National Development Plan and the Sustainable Development Goals. 
While the implementation of the WASHSIS survey to gather relevant data about the water and sanitation conditions of nearly 4 thousand schools was very successful, challenges such as high logistics costs to regularly reach schools in rural areas, and the lack of national standards for data collection had to be addressed. The involvement of school principals was critical to overcome these shortcomings and to successfully implement the survey. On the other hand, this experience also increased cooperation, coordination, and knowledge management opportunities, and it represents an innovative contribution to the MoE as it enhanced its institutional information and knowledge management capacities. The tool designed for the rapid assessment and data collection, as well as the data gathered, was integrated into the MoE’s information system and in the Individual Student Records which should help monitor and implement actions aimed at improving the WASH conditions of schools and support to children. 
In terms of the CO’s structure to achieve programmatic effectiveness, the intersectoral nature of the new structure required additional efforts to improve communication, articulation, and coordination among the different programmatic components. The creation of intersectoral teams under each of the Outcome Areas, comprised of technical staff from each of the technical areas, has gradually become more coherent including important steps towards coordination and engagement with government partners. Early Child Development, under the Early Years Outcome,for instance, has brought together staff and/or consultants from Health and Nutrition, Education, Social Inclusion, Child Protection, WASH, C4D, and Communication and Advocacy. Similar efforts were undertaken for the Adolescents Outcome.
Lastly, the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for telework posed many operational challenges to the CO, but it also provided many lessons learned, especially regarding the need to safeguarding Staff’s well-being and mental health, enhancing efforts to guarantee comfortable spaces for face-to-face and/or virtual work. At the same time, it allowed the CO to develop new tools and strategies to ensure the continued technical assistance to country partners and attention to the most vulnerable groups. It is also worth noting that the Operations area provided key and relevant support in the procurement and acquisition of critical supplies for the response to the pandemic, including the purchase of COVID-19 PCRs and other equipment in support of the Ministry of Health and other government entities. This required greater engagement of Operations in emergency response and wider programmatic work which has contributed to a stronger whole office approach.

LACR,Peru,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons Learned

UNICEF took the opportunity of the crisis triggered by COVID-19 to raise advocacy topics and achieve results on long-term challenges affecting children.
 
a.      A relevant lesson learned is the importance of combining key technical, political capacities and interagency communication for advocacy to achieve long term impact results. The approval of  a ministerial decree allowing Venezuelan migrants in irregular situation to have their status regularized, the decree to protect adolescents in conflict with the law during COVID-19 (resulting in a 51% reduction in the juvenile prison population) or the formulation of the strategic plan to reopen schools, which will guide government decision making are remarkable examples of interagency efforts co-led by UNICEF
 
b.     UNICEF jointly successfully advocated with UNESCO, WB and IDB to ensure education continuity and prompt reopening of schools. UNICEF built on its previous technical work to inform the Ministry of Education’s  I learn at home and “Education does not stop”, strategies, oriented to facilitate general on line learning and to prevent school dropout in the last year of secondary school respectively.
 
c.      UNICEF successfully advocated for a reduction in the number of adolescents in juvenile detention centres and to promote the implementation of alternative socio-educational measures, which is one of the country programme’s goals. This emergency-based advocacy served as an entry point for strengthening UNICEF’s long-term partnership with the Ministry of Justice which will pave the way for effective implementation of a new Juvenile Justice Law and the approval of the National Policy for Juvenile Justice. 
 
d.     UNICEF advocated with Peru government to address child poverty as a priority and to advance into multidimensional poverty measurement, which is a key CPD result to be achieved. UNICEF produced microsimulation to estimate of the increase in child poverty. The study was widely disseminated (30 media mentions, 15.7 million in-reach and 60,000 interactions on social media), and was a key opportunity to position child poverty as a multidimensional phenomenon in the agenda, and reinforced the need for a child-sensitive, universal, and life-cycle based social protection system, which will be one of the components with the upcoming CPD.
 
 
e.      Given the severe health and socio-economic impact of the pandemic in Peru, UNICEF addressed socio-emotional wellbeing and mental health issues of public officials, service providers, and parents in all its strategies and interventions. Mental health as a topic has come to stay to be further addressed in the upcoming CPD with focus on mental health challenges affecting health personnel, support service to address mental health needs of adolescents and its links with violence.

Innovations

Covid-19 presented challenges for UNICEF to develop an emergency response plan, re-prioritize programming and adapt operations to an unprecedented scenario. A key innovation was the rapid conversion from physical in-person and community-based activities to virtual platforms, which will be consider in the future CPD, as an option to reach further audiences and gain efficiency:

a.      Evidence generation. UNICEF conducted five high quality studies using social media, online self-administrated questionnaires, and telephone surveys, applying UNICEF’s guidance for ethical research and personal data protection. In December, a formative-evaluation of the current CPD started, and its findings and recommendations will be used to inform the new CPD/2022-2026.
b.     Capacity building. More than 30,400 civil servants at the national and sub-national level received virtual training on diverse topics (adolescent development, strategic planning, ECD, gender mainstreaming in public policies, digital skills for school staff, stress management and resilience building resilience) increasing scale at lower costs. In addition, almost 500 journalists received training on rights-based reporting.
c.      New forms of service delivery to reach people confined at home, including, with the MIMP, the 1810 child protection hotline and, with the MoH, the Afinidata ECD chatbot pilot and Peru´s first telephone-based mental health care for adolescents, both initiatives to be continued beyond pandemic.
d.      Adolescent participation and empowerment. With the MoE and MIMP, UNICEF contributed to activating virtual coordination mechanisms with adolescent organizations. As a result, the National Adolescent Participation Network was created, representing more than 10,000 adolescents, who expressed their demands through a declaration presented to authorities.
e.     Communication and advocacy. UNICEF rapidly adapted communication, advocacy and mobilization efforts to digital environment in the lockdown and social distancing context, working with partners to reach children and their families and raising adolescents’ voices through digital platforms. Key activities included: production of digital guides and webinars led by UNICEF programme specialists with practical advice for families and caregivers; partnerships with media to broadcast multiplatform live events to help expand organization´s reach and position UNICEF as one of the top reliable sources of public health information; strengthening the use of social listening for permanent monitoring, and for the in-depth analysis of campaigns, to be expanded in 2021 to better target immunization campaigns; online massive events to position adolescents rights at the center of the public agenda, including public presentation of research pieces and promotion of an online petition led by adolescents; multimedia materials for indigenous people and people with disabilities.
 
As massive face-to-face events in Peru continue to be restricted by social distancing, these activities serve as experience for communication and advocacy planning during 2021.

f. Fund Raising channels and initiatives. Digital channel launched this year reached more than 10 million people, and 100,000 leads, generating important synergies with other teams.  3 DRTV initiatives, also new for Peru CO, reached half of the country population. surpassing expected results, fund raising growth reached 4,3 million USD, 55% increase from 2019.




"
LACR,Uruguay,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The lessons learned by UNICEF in 2020 come from its experience of supporting the humanitarian response to the COVID-19 pandemic in a country that has been classified as high income since 2013 with a newly instated government, that enjoys strong institutions and an extensive social protection system (for example, 100 per cent health system coverage, unemployment insurance covering 75 per cent of workers, an existing cash transfer system that is ready for vertical and horizontal expansion) and that has wide-reaching high levels of internet connectivity.
 
Applying the best interests of the child principle: the reopening of schools 
Uruguay exemplified this principle in the region, with remote learning models quickly put in place, the early reopening of its schools and the President’s decision, based on scientific evidence, to keep them open despite the growing number of infections and pressure from certain sectors to close them. The process of returning to school took place in an innovative, gradual and phased way. Unlike in other countries, the return was not staggered by grades, but considered other factors, such as population density, drop-out risk and the completion of educational cycles. However, and despite extraordinary efforts by the educational authorities, social distancing measures posed a challenge for the public education system. Indeed, while private schools have been able to guarantee children's daily attendance, this has been more difficult in public schools. At the same time, the most vulnerable children have experienced greater challenges in sustaining virtual educational activities because of difficulties with internet access and less support from parents who are not equipped to help them. Therefore, UNICEF and its partners face the challenge of working with the Government to overcome the inequities that were already in place before the pandemic, and which have been aggravated by COVID-19.

Coordinating the efforts of international education partners: a priority in the years to come
Led by UNICEF, a group of international partners working on education: UNESCO, the International Labour Organization (ILO), the Organization of Ibero-American States (OEI), the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the World Bank, the Development Bank of Latin America (CAF) and UNICEF) held a public event to launch a digital platform (https://pecu.uy/). This contains all the resources produced by the various organizations for the education community to access easily and is a precedent worth following in future joint initiatives. 
 
A lesson of resilience
Given the country’s characteristics, UNICEF’s humanitarian response work was geared towards strengthening the resilience of both state institutions and families themselves. UNICEF encouraged and supported government partners responsible for public policies to anticipate risks and increase measures to overcome the impact of these disruptive events on the most vulnerable children. 
 
The pandemic has shown that in a country such as Uruguay where the State’s social policies are well integrated and far-reaching, UNICEF’s work can be more valuable if it is directed towards strategies that go beyond the immediate response to the crisis and instead mitigate its consequences. Moreover, UNICEF’s contribution should be to improve the quality of those policies by using the latest tools and knowledge and to bring a child-sensitive perspective. One example of this type of action is the model currently active in the department of Canelones and already mentioned in this report. What started as a traditional cash transfer, UNICEF supplemented with a digital early childhood strategy that provides tools and quality information for parents. UNICEF also tested an innovative violence prevention and detection tool designed by LACRO that does not require a continuous presence. The effectiveness of this model will be evaluated for scaling-up purposes. 
 
Uruguay’s high level of connectivity (88 per cent of households had internet in 2019)[1] greatly facilitated UNICEF’s work to support teachers, caregivers and families with children and to help mitigate the effects of the health crisis and increase their resilience. As such, UNICEF produced and disseminated information for families so that they would have the appropriate tools to best cope with the stress caused by the pandemic. In addition, UNICEF quickly adapted to virtual communication methods, which enabled it to expand its capacity so that it could rapidly provide childhood professionals with the tools to facilitate their work in these extreme circumstances. This virtual system has facilitated the exchange between very busy international experts and many Uruguayans at a lower cost than in person. 
 
Although UNICEF estimates that child monetary poverty will increase by three points, the effects of the pandemic on the lives, development and well-being of children and adolescents, and the impacts on their adult lives, are still unknown. Uruguay has the resources to mitigate these effects: the State and society both have systems that have allowed them to navigate difficult times, and to identify and aid those suffering the most. However, the pandemic is ongoing and there is a very high degree of uncertainty. Therefore, the lessons have not yet been wholly learned and UNICEF will continue systematizing Uruguay’s humanitarian response in 2021. This systematization should help develop knowledge on the mechanisms of Uruguay’s resilience and shed light on the added value of an agency such as UNICEF working in a high-income country that is facing unprecedented humanitarian demands.
 
Conclusion
No society is exempt from the negative effects of a crisis of this magnitude, but Uruguay has demonstrated how important social protection systems are for mitigating humanitarian disasters. Uruguay is also showing positive signs that children are a priority. It is not by chance that UNICEF has been able to assist in this emergency. However, as UNICEF cannot and should not do so alone, it has strengthened existing alliances and developed new ones with state institutions, civil society and international financial institutions. It will not be possible to respond to the medium- and long-term impacts of this pandemic unless we work with all the agencies of the United Nations. The new United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) has created an opportunity and UNICEF is committed to making it a reality.

LACR,Venezuela,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF should continue addressing the scale and complexity of the challenges in the country, leaving no child behind, leveraging on preparedness and response capacity; prioritization schemes to focus on actions with the highest humanitarian impact; strengthening the resilience of those most affected by the crisis; maintaining the operational functions of key infrastructures and services for children; strengthening joint projects with other agencies to maximize limited resources and collectively mitigate the risks that may affect UN operations; and pursuing humanitarian advocacy with all stakeholders.
To address the most pressing local needs, vulnerabilities and capacity gaps, UNICEF’s response to the crisis in Venezuela requires: (a) strengthening a people-centred, principled, accountable, cost-effective and decentralized humanitarian response; (b) improving delivery of and access to basic social services including with the support of the private sector; (c) reinstating livelihoods and building resilience; (d) restoring people’s confidence in collective action; (e) making the best use of UNICEF staff and established relations with Government and local authorities; and (f) building trust and confidence in State and non-State actors’ relations particularly through the grassroot actions of our implementing partners.
Lesson learned in 2020 that will inform 2021 planning include but are not limited to: 
(a) Continue implementing a decentralized approach with the reinforcement of field offices and more continuous support from the Country Office.  Specific performance indicators should be included in the section’s workplans to monitor the outcomes of decentralization for children, and AAP programming should be emphasized to offset the data gap.  Dedicated in-house capacity should be put in place to facilitate knowledge acquisition and experiencing sharing between the team at national, regional and local levels.
(b) Maintain efforts in implementation of systems strengthening initiatives, including incentives programs, as well as ‘flagship quick impact projects,’ that bear maximum impact on the lives of children, build resilience of care givers, pave the work to future recovery, maintain positive posture with all stakeholders, demonstrate agility to respond, mobilize innovative tools of the Organization and, constitute the backbone of communication and advocacy strategies.
(c) Broaden the collective action of the team tested in the COVID-19 response, documenting positive outcomes of joint approaches through the deployment of Caracas-based staff to Field Office to demonstrate how UNICEF carries its duties in the context of Venezuela and guarantees continuous humanitarian access.
(d) Develop, pursue and broaden joint projects with the UN system and the private sector as a preferred approach to help contribute to the forthcoming Strategic Country Framework bound to start in 2022, in order to maximize effectiveness in a likely resource-stringent environment.
(e) Enhance development of capacity building and information management mechanisms, including dissemination of tools for data visualizations to ensure transparency, accountability and quality information.
(e) Further develop early warning and early action systems.  UNICEF’s large presence in the field is both an opportunity that should be leveraged and a risk that must be permanently assessed and mitigated.
(f) Coordinate effectively with partners and perform early planning exercises. Despite achievements in 2020, there is still room to improve reporting and monitoring processes. Train implementing partner staff in administrative and operational issues to achieve constant improvement. Strengthening the role of Venezuelan civil society is fundamental to expand management and response capacities while respecting national context, culture and legislation.
(g) Enhance data collection to offset the challenges in accessing qualitative and quantitative information, pursue capacity building of implementing partners and government technical entities to help raise the level of understanding of the status, treatment and follow-up provided to children and to pregnant and lactating women. 
(h) Support personal protection of frontline workers in the health, nutrition, education, child protection and WASH sector, as a way to guarantee service continuity.
(i) Pursue training, incentives programs, technical assistance and renovation of infrastructures to create a conducive environment for frontline workers dedicated to children. 
(j) UNICEF’s external communications and advocacy strategy should be adapted to anticipate and respond to the humanitarian crisis, prevent reputational risks due to a highly polarized political environment and, maintain the robust posture of UNICEF as the leading voice for child rights.
(l) Enhance UNICEF’s efforts to underscore the plea and forge a response to out of school children, disabled children and those belonging to ethnic groups and, devote more attention on Early Childhood Development and adolescents. 
(m) Expand proven alternative solutions to offset the weakness of school feeding and place a heavier focus on community-driven response, innovative solutions and win-win partnerships. 
(n) Optimize presence and interventions in vulnerable areas of the country to guide sector intervention by placing a heavier focus on intersectoral implementations to promote comprehensive care, cost-effectiveness, higher value for money, sustainability, PSEA and strengthened information management systems that merge evidence generation and human-interest stories.
(o) Leverage the capacity of the private sector including suppliers, innovators and donors and partners to streamline our supply chain and provide the operational agility required by such a volatile and unpredictable humanitarian context. 
(p) Reinforce the simplification of internal processes spanning from staff recruitment to program implementation, finances, procurement and supply management and ensure a better leverage of the digital economy.

MENAR,Algeria,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Key lessons learned in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic were highlighted during implementation of the CPD 2016–2021. The pandemic showed that times of crisis creates many constraints, but also opportunities. In Algeria, the crisis further revealed the relevance of issues that UNICEF had been advocating over the past years, such as school dropout prevention, psycho-social support and positive parenting practices, which are now positioned at the top of the political agenda. 

Sustained and long-term partnerships with the national authorities have boosted UNICEF’s agility in the context of crisis. Indeed, UNICEF was one of the first agencies to provide technical support to the MoH in developing and implementing its response plan to the COVID-19 pandemic. UNICEF was also able to support the ONPPE in its RCCE/C4D campaigns combined with the promotion of children’s rights by producing adequate materials on a child-centred helpline and of positive parenting practices in the context of confinement and acute stress. In the education sector, UNICEF’s strengthened its partnership with the MoE to collaborate on digital learning alternatives. The prior relationship with CNES allowed to include social protection for children as a priority of the draft socio-economic response plan to COVID-19, developed jointly by the Government and the United Nations system. The pre-crisis, evidence-based work on the Universal Child Benefit (UCB) was very helpful in terms of readiness and the ability to make concrete and well-developed proposals in the debate on countercyclical measures considered by the national authorities.

The pandemic showed UNICEF’s comparative advantage in C4D programming and its strong RCCE response. RCCE activities focused on raising awareness among the population through C4D campaigns on COVID-19 prevention, promoting positive parenting practices, fighting misinformation, parenting and stigma. Involving partners such as the SMA in the COVID-19 response was a strategic decision that allowed UNICEF to provide support even at the community level. The use of social media proved highly efficient in reaching out to a wide public; involving well-known influencers was another effective way to spread the word. The challenging situation also allowed UNICEF to build on its internal capacity to implement a multidisciplinary approach to RCCE, through the combination of informative messages (communication at large) and messages targeting behavioural change (C4D). UNICEF’s strong RCCE response allowed for a significant collaboration with various institutional partners and United Nations agencies. Nevertheless, key challenges remain in sustaining an adequate level of response given limited internal capacity and high expectations in C4D, and in strengthening the evidence foundations of C4D work.

Generating evidence and data supports response in times of crisis. MICS6 dissemination resulted in the availability of up-to-date data and indicators for children in Algeria, and provided relevant information for the response to COVID-19, the United Nations Cooperation Framework orientations and the development of the new CPD 2022–2026. Despite the shift in national priorities and the adaptation of the UNICEF programme as a result of the pandemic, ACO continued to work towards achieving key results on data generation. This is extremely important in order to enhance not only the immediate response to the health situation, but also to improve future programming. The optimization of current partnerships with CNES and the MoH, among others, is a catalyst to ensure accrued MICS data utilization through various channels, such as the ongoing establishment of the national SDG platform with the CNES.
Another example of the importance of the availability of new data for advocacy and policy making is the N-MODA analysis that started towards the end of the year with the publication of MICS data. N-MODA outcomes will allow the national Government to inform policies based on longitudinal trends on multidimensional child poverty between 2019, 2012-2013 and 2006. In following years, a strong emphasis will be put on using these new dataset and analysis to inform policies and programming, including the United Nations CCA.

Another key lesson learned concerned ACO planning capabilities linked to the new working conditions that were implemented due to the pandemic. The new context highlighted the need for better collaboration between the Operations and Programme teams to improve efficiency, risks mitigation, and compliance with rules and procedures. Strategic operations should enhance results-based planning and client-oriented services, particularly by strengthening synergies and systematizing satisfaction feedback surveys, with special attention to the challenging environment that requires strong capacity to adapt and respond adequately, efficiently and effectively.
 
Since the beginning the current programme, UNICEF has implemented several innovative initiatives across sectors. UNICEF continued its support to the MoH in Health Information System strengthening, which is among the key priorities of the Government Action Plan (February 2020). The development and implementation of the Dossier Electronique de Vaccination (DEVAC, Electronic Software on Immunization) operational in 80 municipalities, the ongoing digitalization of the maternal death audits and the equipping of decentralized epidemiology and preventive medicine services to strengthen their capacities in tracking COVID-19 contact cases are but a few of the significant results worth highlighting. UNICEF fostered innovation in programming for and with youth across the implementation of GenU Youth Challenge and other Life Skills and Citizenship Education (LSCE) interventions. UNICEF team has initiated a dialogue in 2020 with the Ministry of Vocational Training to identify the modalities to institutionalize GenU within the regular programming of national entities.
 
The above lessons learned and innovations are coming at a critical time, in the transition between two five-year plans both for the UN system and for UNICEF. They will constitute building blocks for the current joint analysis and planning process within United Nations Cooperation Framework orientations, as well as for the development of the new CPD 2022–2026.

MENAR,Djibouti,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Tout en posant des défis significatifs à la mise en œuvre des programmes et aux modalités traditionnelles de mise en œuvre, la crise COVID-19 a également présenté un certain nombre d’opportunités pour un positionnement stratégique de l’UNICEF par rapport à certaines thématiques et stratégies de mise en œuvre.  
 
Dans le domaine de l’EAH, la nécessité de mettre en œuvre les mesures barrières pour réduire la propagation de la pandémie au sein de la population, ont augmenté au niveau national, l'intérêt porté aux pratiques d’hygiène qui précédemment attiraient moins d’attention par rapport au volet du programme concernant l’accès à l’eau potable. Ceci malgré le plaidoyer constant mené par l’UNICEF aux différents niveaux pour le renforcement de la composante « Hygiène et Assainissement » de la stratégie nationale de l’EAH. En effet, le plan de réponse COVID-19 du gouvernement inclut une très forte composante EAH, avec un accent non seulement sur l’amélioration de l’accès à l’eau pour les populations à risque, mais surtout le renforcement des mesures de lavage des mains au savon dans les sites publics et dans les institutions. Par ailleurs, l’organisation de la Journée mondiale de lavage des mains au savon en 2020 a été utilisée comme tremplin par le gouvernement avec le soutien de l’UNICEF pour booster la pratique des mesures barrières. En définitive, la réponse à la pandémie de la COVID-19 a permis de rehausser le profil des activités d’hygiène et assainissement et cette dynamique sera exploité en 2021 pour promouvoir davantage les activités d’hygiène et assainissement dans le pays. Par ailleurs, compte tenu du rôle essentiel de l’hygiène dans la lutte contre la COVID-19, l’on a observé une attitude très engagée des partenaires gouvernementaux lors de l’exercice WASHBAT, permettant ainsi de cerner, suivant une méthodologie participative incluant tous les acteurs du secteur, les goulots d’étranglements dans le secteur EAH et d’intégrer les mesures correctrices dans les stratégies et plans nationaux. En 2021, ces acquis vont permettre à l’UNICEF de renforcer le plaidoyer pour l’institutionnalisation de l’hygiène ainsi que l’élaboration de la stratégie nationale    
 
Toujours dans le contexte du COVID-19, l’UNICEF a pu se positionner comme partenaire technique clé pour valider, coordonner et accompagner la mise en œuvre du plan national de RCCE par le Ministère de la santé en collaboration avec d’autres départements sectoriels et des ONG nationales. A travers une enquête de perception sur le COVID-19, l’UNICEF va obtenir les évidences socio-comportementales pour peaufiner davantage ce plan de communication pour le développement RCCE. Comme dans le secteur EAH, la crise du COVID-19 a permis à rehausser le profil de la communication pour le changement de comportements et la communication de risques comme stratégie clé dans l’engagement communautaire en faveur des droits des enfants. 
 
Dans le cadre de la réponse aux urgences, l’UNICEF Djibouti utilisé pendant les trois dernières années les coupons alimentaires en se basant sur l’appui du PAM au système de protection sociale à travers le registre social. Cependant, pour la réponse au COVID-19, le bureau a utilisé le système national des transferts monétaires à travers le pacte national de solidarité mis en place par le Gouvernement et a pu observer l’efficacité de cette réponse. L’alignement avec le système national s’est imposé dans la mesure où le COVID-19 a touché des catégories de la population non enregistrées dans le registre social (par exemple, les journaliers) et dont seul le gouvernement disposait de statistiques. Ceci a permis d’exposer les défauts d’un système qui repose sur les coupons. Certaines familles dont le coupons ne correspondaient pas à leurs besoins réels préféraient de les échanger contre d’autre articles qui n’étaient pas forcément disponibles dans les boutiques de quartiers qui avaient été sélectionnées par le MASS. Au-delà de la réponse au COVID-19, le système de coupons alimentaires rend les bénéficiaires du système très visibles – par exemple pendant l’enregistrement par les assistants sociaux devant les boutiques ou les discussions avec les boutiquiers pour les changements d’articles - et a pour conséquence donc une stigmatisation qui a été soulevé par les bénéficiaires. Afin de remédier à cette situation, le bureau considérera dans l’avenir et dans la mesure du possible le transfert monétaire à travers les institutions de paiement ou une autre forme de paiement électronique aux bénéficiaires. 
 
L’une des difficultés majeures observés durant cette réponse à la crise du COVID-19 consiste dans le manque d’information par rapport à certains types de population en besoin d’appui, d’autant plus que la crise a touché une population que les programmes réguliers d’assistance sociale n’ont pas l’habitude de couvrir, notamment les travailleurs informels. Cette situation a rendu de plus en plus évident le besoin de procéder à une préparation aux urgences et améliorer les connaissances sur les populations qui seraient concernées par chaque scénario de crise.

Malgré les progrès en 2020 dans le renforcement des systèmes de suivi-évaluation sectoriels et le fait que la crise COVID-19 a obligé le gouvernement à générer régulièrement des statistiques sur le nombre de cas, de guérison et de décès, ce qui a donné une place centrale à une planification basée sur les évidences, l’absence de données d’enquête à jour sur les indicateurs clés de la situation des enfants depuis 2012 continue à poser un défi pour le suivi des progrès vers l’atteinte des ODD et les autres objectifs nationaux de développement, pour l’évaluation des différents programmes mis en œuvre et pour la planification basée sur les évidences en général. La nécessité de conduire dans les meilleurs délais une enquête transversale de type MICS/EDS continue à s’imposer. Il est attendu que l’élaboration du nouveau plan national de développement en 2021 ainsi que l’exercice de Voluntary National Review (VNR) qui est également prévu pour 2021, devraient exposer les gaps en termes de données d’impact et donner un nouvel élan aux discussions autour de la planification d’une enquête nationale sur les indicateurs sociaux. L’UNICEF en profitera pour continuer son plaidoyer pour mener une enquête MICS. 

"
MENAR,Egypt,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"COVID-19 required UNICEF to respond quickly and adapt constantly throughout the year, fielding urgent requests from multiple national counterparts for support. At the onset of the crisis, where critical IPC supplies such as PPE and disinfectants were essential and in limited supply, UNICEF quickly secured in-kind support from private sector partners and reprogrammed funds from existing grants to support frontline health workers. Maintaining flexibility and pursuing both local and international procurement enabled UNICEF to source PPE and disinfectants in a timely manner. Unprecedented global demand for equipment including ventilators far outstripped supply, and in future it may be necessary for UNICEF and the wider UN system to consider prioritisation of country needs sooner, rather than address supply requests on a first-come-first served basis.
 
As part of the response UNICEF adapted its communication tools to further its reach into the community. UNICEF launched its own TikTok account in September 2020 to help reach a younger audience which has moved away from more established social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. Social media is becoming more creative and user-friendly , but whilst UNICEF’s Risk Communication work achieved extraordinary results with a reach of over 60 million people, community engagement cannot rely on the same methodologies which are largely technology based. It will be important in 2021 to review how to increase the reach into communities to have real conversations and promote impact and change. 
 
The value of RapidPro was evidenced this year, engaging with TKP beneficiaries on COVID-19 prevention and positive parenting. RapidPro allowed engagement and collection of data via short message service (SMS), an important means of better reaching rural and marginalized communities in a population where the penetration rate of mobile phone is around 95% but smart phones account for around only 16%[1].
 
UNICEF’s positive parenting programming also benefitted enormously from the new partnership with MoSI: by partnering with the Ministry, it enabled UNICEF to reach agreement with a production company which will be selling the rights to the upcoming TV drama on positive parenting to major broadcasters. With the support of MoSI, UNICEF was able to secure sufficient revenue from broadcasters to cover at least 40% of production costs. The TV drama is scheduled to be broadcast during Ramadan in 2021.
 
It is becoming increasingly clear that it is important to interconnect the different social services with the growing social protection network. The Country Programme already focuses on addressing multidimensional poverty in Egypt through improvement of a range of basic services, but a workshop is planned for early 2021 to review in more detail. The participants of the Takaful and Karama cash transfer programmes are identified as the most vulnerable families in Egypt and are thus a logical starting point for all programmes that aim to fulfill the rights of the most vulnerable. Global evidence points consistently to the need to ensure that cash transfers are accompanied by a series of ‘soft’ services and referral services in order for the cash to be most effective in fulfilling children’s rights. Further investment and reform of the social work system will be an important component of the remainder of the country programme in partnership with relevant line ministries and under the leadership of MoSS.
 
The pandemic was an opportunity to accelerate national efforts to modernise ways of working, and further digitise the economy. It also highlighted inefficiencies in how different stakeholders communicate in the provision of basic services to children. There were understandable connectivity challenges for many partners and service providers, and the switch to online training was not without its challenges. UNICEF adopted a new strategy and mobilized health workforces at the decentralized level through an organized system of online meetings, trainings and follow-up. The online sessions were instrumental in re-organizing the work of PHC services during the outbreak’s peak. UNICEF connected health authorities and professionals at national and decentralized levels with local authorities and communities, which in fact helped reverse the downward trend in the utilization of maternal and child health services. 
 
Similarly, with an initial schools’ closure as part of the response to COVID-19, MoETE moved to e-learning on the government-owned Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB). This significant achievement was, however, not available to those most vulnerable who have no access to the internet. While UNICEF responded through distribution of textbooks and learning materials to these groups, their learning outcomes are likely to be negatively impacted, possibly leading to increased drop-out. UNICEF’s solution is to procure and distribute tablets and internet packages for the most vulnerable, as well as the introduction of the Learning Passport, a tech platform developed in partnership with Microsoft and the University of Cambridge, enabling high quality and flexible learning, to fill the gap for these groups in the coming year. A future goal is to secure data-free or discounted data packages from internet and phone service providers in order to break down a key access barrier for children to stay online and learn. Data packages could also be used as incentives to ensure students reach certain levels of attainment. UNICEF will need to continue to invest in private sector partnerships in order to leverage their reach and expertise to promote inclusion of the most vulnerable children in the learning reforms. 
 
In the area of child protection, social workers and Child Helpline staff were trained to provide remote and blended service provision including psychosocial support, but such modalities have their drawbacks and will require refinement. The pandemic re-emphasises the need for UNICEF’s continued investment in the development of information management systems including case management systems, which allow for safe and efficient data collection, storage, sharing and reporting. 
 
UNICEF was able to strengthen its standing as a knowledge-leader this year by launching a survey series to monitor the situation of children through repeated telephone-based assessments. The assessments generated an improved understanding for both UNICEF, Government and other development partners of the likely impact of the pandemic on children.

MENAR,Iran,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons learned

The key lessons learned in 2020 were on adaptive management, operations and programming, the importance of flexibility to respond to urgent humanitarian needs, and the gains from leveraging new and emerging opportunities and partnerships. In the second half of 2020, UNICEF conducted an Internal Strategic Moment of Reflection to discuss implementation of recommendations from the Mid-Term Review (2019); lessons learned about adaptations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters and economic challenges;  and priorities requiring adjustments during the one year extension of the UNDAF and Country Programme, to end of December 2022.  
All 15 programme workplans were adapted to enable support to Government’s COVID-19 response, based on the One UN CPRP. Corresponding shifts were made in resource mobilization and re-balancing of resource allocations. Work modalities for UNICEF staff and partners were adapted and challenges to remote delivery and monitoring of programmes were largely overcome through quick application of lessons learned.  For example, training was done online rather than face-to-face to guarantee continuity of technical assistance. Interventions were re-strategized to be risk-informed and the Office was retooled to better deliver emergency responses and enhance emergency preparedness throughout sectors.
The operational and programming challenges in 2020 accelerated UNICEF’s application of change strategies, particularly on social and behavioural change communication and on cross-sectoral collaboration and convergence of resources and actions.  UNICEF leveraged the UN’s CPRP to establish a UN RCCE coordination committee for the first time and is supporting MoHME to continue this beyond the pandemic and recovery periods.  Adolescent-related programmes of different Ministries were synergized under a comprehensive, coordinated model for health and well-being. Of particular note were the practical UNICEF actions that resulted in more effective inter-organizational cooperation between MoHME and MOSY. 
Despite many challenges in 2020, UNICEF’s success was in mitigating the adverse impact of the pandemic and economic challenges on children. Meanwhile ICO continued to apply lessons learned through the 2019 Mid-Term Review(MTR) and contributed to accelerating results in the five programmatic areas identified in the MTR: a) neo natal health in deprived provinces b) inclusive education for Afghan refugees and children with disabilities; c) adolescent health well-being through a life skill focus; d) preparedness capacity of provinces for disaster response; e) child friendly cities with a vision of transition to child friendly provinces for the next programme cycle. 

Emerging opportunities

UNICEF harnessed emerging opportunities created by the pandemic. For example, as mentioned above, due to the COVID-19 pandemic UNICEF was invited by the Prisons Organization to support children in correction and rehabilitation centres and incarcerated mothers and their infants. The vulnerability of these children and mothers is a serious concern beyond the pandemic. Another leveraged opportunity was the creation of an Iranian Task Force on Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS). UNICEF further solidified its Task Force on Children in Street Situations following requests by the Government to support COVID-19 interventions for these children, and aims to expand partnerships with relevant government entities. The success of an expanded partnership with SWO highlighted opportunities for protective services to previously hard-to-reach children and families. Both Task Forces fostered improved cross-sector collaboration within UNICEF and among relevant governmental partners. 

The UNICEF Country Programme does not include water, sanitation and hygiene, but the pandemic opened an opportunity to partner with the SEO to procure WASH/IPC items for special schools, and to partner with SWO on an adaptive learning strategy. These interventions significantly helped children with disabilities to safely access learning. The COVID-19 pandemic created an opportunity for MoHME and UNICEF to assess the Primary Health Care System in terms of its resilience to different types of emergencies and to design shock-resistant interventions to enhance health system capacity and quality of care in different situations.

The new Law on Protection of Children and Adolescents provided a valuable opportunity to advocate with relevant government stakeholders for multi-sectoral programming for addressing the needs of children who are out-of-school, in contact with the law, affected by migration, have incarcerated parents, have disabilities, affected by substance abuse. 
With the support of the UNICEF Regional Office, UNICEF Iran conducted a mapping of Iran’s private sector across ten programmatic areas. The opportunities that emerged from this study for innovative partnerships have already shaped UNICEF Iran’s 2021 engagement with the private sector. More opportunities to leverage business for results will be reflected in the 2022 workplans and in consultations to design the next country programme.

Innovations

The ‘UNICEF Iran Innovation Strategy 2020-2022’ was developed using a portfolio approach updated with mapping of the programmatic challenges and COVID-19 adaptations. Two UNICEF Global Innovation Fund calls on Blockchain and Child Online Safety were facilitated for Iranian startups. The Office also participated in INOTEX 2020 and shared innovation packages with Pardis Technology Park. In partnership with the Vice Presidency for Science and Technology, a call for the National Innovations for Children Award produced over 80 innovative solutions; finalists will be selected and awarded in 2021.

UNICEF engineered innovative operational solutions to the obstacles caused by sanctions and movement restrictions. Sanctions made it challenging to find suppliers and shipping companies willing and able to ship to Iran and there were significant increases in freight costs due to closed borders and the very limited number of flights to Iran. With the support of Governments of Qatar, China and Iran and an innovative partnership with Qatar Airlines, UNICEF eliminated around US$700,00 in freight costs for procurement of COVID-19 related supplies, thus enabling procurement of PPE for 1,300 additional healthcare workers. Due to an enforced working-from-home modality during the peak periods of the pandemic, UNICEF successfully established a new system to process all banking transactions without delays through receipt of electronic staff signatures.

"
MENAR,Iraq,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Due to the political and security situation coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, UNICEF re-imagined its work and outreach modalities, adopting new and innovative approaches to implement  its programmes and achieve results for children. UNICEF’s engagement with local  communities and workforce, adolescents and youth networks, along with the use  of digital platforms, was instrumental in ensuring continuity of services within  an extremely complex operational environment.
  
Community-based child protection and social workers hired from  local communities were crucial enablers for ensuring continuity of services. Their  continued access to affected populations ensured follow up on existing child  protection cases as well as to identify and respond to emerging ones. Their  field presence facilitated the digital delivery of critical and much needed services,  such as MHPSS support and awareness-raising activities. 
  
UNICEF’s lead role within the humanitarian cluster  mechanism led to strong coordination between child protection and GBV  sub-cluster members leading to capacity building of implementing partners on  the new modes of delivery ensuring continuity of services as well as ensuring  the safety of service providers and beneficiaries. The successful adaptation  of services, approaches and guidelines was complemented by the existence and use  of digital platforms, including social media and helplines, offering a great  opportunity for continued engagement and remote delivery of both GBV and  child protection services. However, this also highlighted the digital divide  that exists based on age, gender and socio-economic backgrounds. 
   
The digital divide also constituted a challenge to delivering equitable and  quality alternative learning opportunities for children and young people. The  pandemic constituted a ‘wake up’ call as well as an opportunity to leverage viable  technological options, such as education TV and online portals, to complement  school-based conventional teaching-learning processes. However, inequalities  in access to internet connectivity and to supplementary printed materials at  household level had to be addressed. Online programmes managed to reach the  most vulnerable beneficiaries through youth networks, education TV and the  provision of self-learning materials. The alternative service delivery  mechanism was also tailored to meet the education needs of children left  without access to education due to the sudden closure and consolidation of  IDP and refugee camps. 
  
The need to deliver equitable and quality learning  alternatives also revealed the importance of having stronger sector  coordination to streamline education partners support and avoid duplication  of interventions. UNICEF is currently leading the establishment of the  Education Sector Coordination Group; its role as the secretariat of the  sector coordination body will offer the opportunity to continue building a  robust coordination system, led by MoE, and to facilitate alignment of  education partners interventions and financial support to national education  plans and priorities.
   
Restrictions of movement and other COVID-19-related challenges hampered not  only the delivery of child protection and education services, but also the  ability of young leaders and organizations to mobilize and support their  communities. Nevertheless, with support from UNICEF and partners, young  people were at the forefront of finding innovative ways to communicate with  their government and communities through digital channels, such as social  media and video-conferencing platforms. U-Report was quickly identified as an  effective tool to disseminate prevention and protection messaging and share  timely and relevant information with young people and their communities.  Young people proved to be critical in bridging the digital divide by  providing information and knowledge to communities that do not have access to  digital technologies by tailoring messages and channels to reach diverse  audiences and reflect multiple voices as well as by disseminating accurate  information in a manner that respects local values and traditions. The  complexity of the political situation and decision-making structures in the  country makes it challenging for young people to engage effectively in  decision-making processes; however, UNICEF maximized its efforts through  government partners and youth serving organizations to ensure that  adolescents and youth were treated as partners in all phases of the COVID-19  response. As a result, they were gradually and systematically included and  involved, through consultations and knowledge-sharing, in decision-making at  all levels.
  
Youth and community engagement were also conducive to the  achievement of WASH-related results. Young volunteers were actively engaged  and their capacity in IPC was strengthened so that they could not only share  their knowledge and skills with their families and peers, but also act as  agents of change in the future. 
  
Changing behavior and social norms to improve hygiene  practices and promote water safety is essential for sustainable progress in  the long term. However, disparities in access to WASH services persist, rooted  in structural social and political factors and are exacerbated by inequitable  allocations of resources. Destitute and vulnerable groups, including children  with disabilities or those living in remote areas and poverty-stricken  households, must be specifically targeted in development programmes. UNICEF  programming needs to focus in out-of-camp, marginalized areas to ensure  availability of critical WASH services and expand innovative climate resilient  WASH projects and alternative water sources. 
   
The pandemic also revealed the need to better integrate RCCE and C4D  activities along with external communication across all programmes, starting  from the design and planning phases. Especially focusing on the gender  dimension to address the current digital gender divide, especially in terms  of outreach and engagement on social media. To this aim, UNICEF will have to  find ways, such as targeted promotional ads, to specifically address girls  and women.
  
Challenges persist on child marriages, girls’ transition  to secondary education and GBV. These are being addressed by  mainstreaming strategies of social mobilization and strengthening awareness  raising about harmful impacts of child marriages, and by increasing access to  secondary schooling and providing gender sensitive WASH services in schools,  including menstrual hygiene management. 
  
The year ended with the rapid, unexpected and unplanned  closure of IDP camps, creating additional vulnerabilities for an already  marginalized population. UNICEF along with humanitarian partners will continue  its support for the displaced children and their families in close  collaboration with the Government to ensure that return and secondary  displacement occur in a dignified manner and in compliance with international  standards.
   
"
MENAR,Jordan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"COVID-19 and the restraints it has implied for programmes has triggered ample opportunity for innovation. UNICEF Jordan has noted some emergent lessons learned, especially in the area of community involvement, learning recovery and reimagining education, rethinking service delivery and building back better. 
The importance of involving communities and families in programmme implementation became more critical during the COVID response. Learning Bridges is an innovative approach to supporting children in overcoming learning loss caused by the pandemic as it supports learning at home through learning packs with QR codes that offer blended learning opportunities. However, without the support of parents or caretakers at home, children are less likely to engage in or retain the learning from activities. Syrian Assistant Teachers and staff working at the Makani Centers and serving the communities in which they live, have been imperative in distributing learning material, supporting children with disability, and following up with at-risk children during UNICEF’s Safely-Back-to School campaigns. 
The Makani centers demonstrated that a rapid response and provision of an enabling environment is central to continued service delivery during a crisis like COVID-19. By responding swiftly, the Makani centers were able to maintain contact to the most vulnerable communities and provide them with important support and services. Both frontline staff and the communities in which they operate responded positively and proactively, in part due to the enabling environment, producing creative and practical activities and solutions based on community needs. This allowed for quick bridging of emerging gaps in both host communities and in the camps. 
Jordan has shown resilience in pursuing development goals despite regional volatility, fiscal constraints, and economic shocks. While there has been progress to strengthen the national social protection system, a major lesson learnt in 2020 is the importance of further investment in emergency preparedness. The development of a shock-responsiveness social protection system for Jordan should take not only take gender needs and vulnerabilities into account but focus on system preparedness and more durable mechanisms for all three pillars of the national system outlined in the NSPS 2019-2025: Opportunity (decent work/ social security), Empowerment (social services), and Dignity (social assistance). To strengthen the maturity of the social protection sector to be able to provide a rapid and better coordinated shock-response, synergies and harmonization between the humanitarian and the national systems should be considered. In Parallel, the use of economic modelling should be institutionalized to understand how the economy might react to shocks, or changes in policy, to be able to understand the implications for different social groups and inform responses.
By implementing a pre-COVID-19 rapid response assessment, UNICEF identified the most readily available communication tools, to stay connected to beneficiaries and rapidly provide critical services, through a modality that was familiar and acceptable to a wide range of beneficiaries. WhatsApp has proven especially effective in providing community-based groups for parents. Aided by early childhood development facilitators/community volunteers these WhatsApp groups helped address the anxiety and insecurity parents and their young children felt during the pandemic by promoting positive interactions, stimulation to promote early development, communication, and disciplining practices.
Using new technology to deal with Jordan extreme water shortage, UNICEF Jordan supported the development and launch of the Jordan Ministry of Water and Irrigation official mobile application or “Water App”, a mobile application that brings together water utilities and customers in a common platform.   The application, launched in July 2020, allows the public across the country to report any water network leakages or issues with the water and wastewater systems directly to the managing water utility maintenance crews, and digitalizes services, provided by water utilities companies in Jordan (Aqaba, Miyahuna and Yarmouk). The application contributes to improved customer satisfaction and trust between customers and service providers, as well as improving poor non-revenue water rates due to timely reporting and maintenance of leaking water infrastructure. 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic does not impact boys and girls equally and collection of sex aggregated data is therefore also important in evaluating the gendered impacts of the pandemic, like economic vulnerability and dependence, early marriage, exposure to domestic violence, etc. As most interaction such as schooling etc. move online and become less accessible for girls and women, data becomes more important in evaluating the differences in access.  The collection of sex disaggregated data has enabled UNICEF to better estimate the needs faced by the Jordanian girls and women.
A challenge this year has been that UNICEF, because of the programmatic calibration due to COVID 19, had to be put planned activities on hold. In many of the UNICEF programme areas the delivery targets had to be scaled back as the delivery moved to new modalities. The TVET programmes which usually reaches close to 2,000 adolescent and youth per year had to be transformed, to focus on new and emerging sectors (such as digital and computing) and moved online and with blended learning, which meant that the programme was not able to achieve its target. The child protection programme was only able to achieve 44 percent (6,653) of the planned target (15,000) on Child protection specialized services for boys and girls as the programme had to move from face to face to online services. In the health sector the immunization programme as disrupted as the children became more difficult to reach and the focus of the health worker moved to the response to the pandemic. In the education sector activities linked to the system strengthening, licensing and accreditation, the teachers and NFE Facilitators professional development, and the instructional leadership trainings were delayed. Evidence generation was also disrupted as data collection became more difficult. The Multidimensional Child Poverty in Jordan and the Joint Comprehensive Vulnerability Analysis was both delayed as the priorities of the Government shifted to COVID-19. 
COVID-19 also meant additional challenges to the operation of UNICEF Jordan. With the prolonged lockdown and the frequent closure of key government offices, interaction in areas such as clearance and protocol became more difficult and the prolonged closure of the airport in Amman had an impact on overall staff welfare. 
"
MENAR,Lebanon,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Due to the economic situation, UNICEF used innovative means to support youth into entrepreneurial opportunities despite COVID-19 restrictions. UNICEF content partners digitized UNICEF’s social entrepreneurship course, the incubation curricula and other courses including digital media literacy, social media marketing and mobile application development. Promising projects from the training received online coaching. This approach provided 1,859 youth with social entrepreneurship and creative thinking courses, and 966 youth with digital skills training. Of the 1,859 youths, 44 percent received incubation support and up to USD2,000seed funding.
 
UNICEF Adolescent and Youth Programme expanded its skills training and employment support component to support WASH in pioneering a Cash 4 Work project. More than 2,000 youths were trained and referred to the WASH programme, which employed 1,182 youths with a minimum of 40 days paid work rehabilitating 17 springs and constructing 33 reservoirs. Beyond improving water services, this provided positive change by building bridges of social cohesion and integration amongst the youth on site. 
 
During the explosion response, use of simple but effective coordination and mobilization initiatives such as establishing UNICEF tent hubs was highly valued. Three UNICEF tents established in the most affected neighborhoods were referral and outreach points for the affected people, which proved essential in reaching the most vulnerable children and families. Inclusiveness of these tents to bring together partner and non-partner organizations to join efforts helped in ensuring coordinated assessment and division of labour among the many aid organizations.
 
Seed funding and coaching was provided to four 2018 and 2019 Generation of Innovation Leaders (GIL) teams to support families affected by the blast. The businesses provided valuable furniture, woodworking, volunteer and construction services to affected families. This enhanced the support provided by UNICEF to GIL beneficiaries by providing business opportunities and work experience during an otherwise difficult time.
 
UNICEF implemented several technology solutions for the capture of information and to improve efficiency and effectiveness of operations. This includes C4D’s complaint mechanism for the measles campaign, the EPICS dashboard providing real time information on UNICEF staff to security and HR in case of emergency and extension of the RIMS system for cross-sector referrals between UNICEF partners. The child protection section implemented a clinical management of rape (CMR) mobile application for medical doctors to assist with survivors of rape by grouping all CMR resources in one place. Systems were implemented for child level monitoring in education, and for Child Protection to monitor and follow-up on improvements in psychosocial wellbeing.
 
UNICEF WASH has finalized the implementation of an innovative online digital platform – the WASH Assessment Platform (WAP) to influence daily programme planning, decision making, and nationwide response plans for more than 300,000 refugees in informal settlements. The vulnerability of settlements across the seven governorates in Lebanon is estimated according to the following stressors: water, sanitation, solid waste, and environmental. To standardize data collection in informal settlements and to highlight the various opportunities of intervention within the WASH sector, the WAP was developed by UNICEF Lebanon as a real-time response tool. The WAP aims to influence partners to provide equitable access to WASH services across Lebanon’s informal settlements. 

The Beirut port explosion tested UNICEF Lebanon’s resilience in wholly anticipated ways. Country Office staff exhibited remarkable dedication to vulnerable children and their families in Lebanon in the immediate aftermath of the explosion in the months that followed. Despite devastating personal losses, injuries requiring medical care and substantial damage to their homes and workplace, UNICEF staff returned to work to ensure vital programmes were not disrupted.
 
UNICEF’s operations after the explosion demonstrated that from a HR perspective, the office could respond effectively due to its emergency preparedness and close collaboration between management and the Staff Association. HR’s capitalization on Staff Wellbeing Services became critical in the aftermath of the explosion, with immediate support for relocation of staff and ensuring medical attention and provision of counselling and psychosocial support. 
 
The rapid response by UNICEF health and supply teams to the explosion demonstrated the office’s capacity to respond to critical emergencies. UNICEF’s relationship with the MoPH, and ability to implement quick actions meant that US$1.7 million worth of vaccine stocks were saved. The explosion highlighted the importance of Supply’s ability to mobilise contingency stocks. The ability for Supply to source stocks locally was emphasized, due the COVID-19 increasing global demand for PPE and IPC materials. 
 
The Emergency Cash Grant program for the explosion response, rapidly developed in consultation with regional and headquarter colleagues, was recognized as innovative given its creative approach to rapidly reach vulnerable categories of individuals. Monitoring of the execution of the grants will feed findings into national discussions to develop a new national cash transfer programme.
 
The disruption to essential health services from the explosion and reduction in demand for routine immunization due to COVID-19 are concerning. UNICEF plans to maintain and renew IPC materials and PPE in PHCCs and dispensaries in the most vulnerable municipalities, and conduct outreach activities via social media to encourage access to essential public health services.
 
Despite efforts to reach all vulnerable children with education, increasing poverty is leading families towards negative coping mechanisms harmful to children. The challenges that COVID-19 imposes on the learning environment and learning gaps are increasing risks of children not returning to school. UNICEF plans to provide cash transfers in the 2020-21 school year to support in-class, distance or hybrid education.

Given the fluid programming context in 2020, building a solid evidence base and staying informed on young people’s changing needs and priorities is instrumental in ensuring UNICEF is well positioned to address increased vulnerabilities. The Youth Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices assessment, the two Youth Polls and programme evaluations enabled UNICEF to successfully advocate as well as adapt its programmes to changing priorities and needs. This evidence base will substantially impact the strategic direction of 2021 programming, including supporting protection concerns among young people through the Youth Protection Policy with the Memorandum of Agreement and the Code of Conduct for work-based learning with the Ministry of Labour.

MENAR,Libya,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"41        Based on successful implementation of the Country Programme in 2019-2020, UNICEF will continue to scale-up the following programme innovations in 2021: 
 
(a) BAYTI centres are community-based child-friendly spaces. Bayti centres were designed as a comprehensive strategy to provide multi-sectoral service provision to all vulnerable children identified through community-led outreach and referral. Programmes at these centres are designed to promote and contribute to children and young people’s full development, addressing their physical, cognitive, social and emotional well-being. It links interventions in education (learning support services), child protection (psychosocial support services), adolescent and youth participation (life skills and innovation labs), and health services. During 2021, UNICEF will continue to strengthen and expand services in the 10 Bayti centres and other safe spaces across Libya, including through intersectoral coordination and strengthening partnership with other agencies (e.g. IOM and UNHCR);
 
(b) In July 2020, UNICEF and UNHCR signed a partnership agreement within the BluePrint for Action, for which Libya is a pilot country. In 2020, the two agencies have worked intensively in Libya to transform the way the programmes are designed and to join advocacy efforts for refugee and host community children. UNICEF and UNHCR have committed to support government authorities to (a) include refugee children and families in national systems, policies, plans and service delivery systems; (b) Accelerate access to education, WASH and child protection services for refugee and host community children at risk of being left behind; and (b) Deliver a measurably more effective and efficient joint response for refugee children, their families and host communities, in keeping with the UN reform agenda. Solid foundations have been laid in child protection and education programmes to be scaled up in 2021.  
 
(c) In 2020, UNICEF has further developed its convergence programme in the 24 municipalities/cities that have been selected based on the high number of the vulnerable families and migrant and refugees living in these urban areas. UNICEF has developed a monitoring framework to track access to basic services and household access to services, to be rolled out in 2021. The implementation of this flagship programme will continue in 2021, with a stronger emphasis on southern Libya.
 
42        Despite the encouraging progress made in the peace negotiations during 2020, there are strong indications that the situation in Libya may continue to be unstable and volatile in 2021. The impact of COVID-19 on the capacity of basic health services, as well as children and vulnerable families is becoming increasingly grave. UNICEF undertook an audit and external evaluation of its Country Programme during 2020; the results of these important assessments will feed into an internal review of the programme during 2021 to determine what components need to be adjusted given the evolving context and to begin planning for the next country programme, in line with the new UN Strategic Framework. Though continued support and system strengthening of the national basic service system will continue to be a priority, UNICEF recognizes the importance of a strong and up-to-date internal risk assessment and contingency plans. Additionally, UNICEF will continue to strengthen its internal emergency preparedness measures during 2021, including (a) identifying solid partnerships that are able to rapidly scale-up response (including in hard to reach/inaccessible areas); (b) ensure that pre-positioned essential stocks are available to allow for a rapid response; (c) strengthen its mechanisms for Accountability to Affected Population, strengthened Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA), including systematizing complaints and reporting mechanisms across its programmes; (d) build the capacity of partners, government counterparts and UNICEF staff to ensure emergency preparedness and response, including with regards to the humanitarian principles and Accountability to Affected Populations; (e) enhance the quality and timeliness of emergency response, including through the diversification of the package of emergency response, expanding the targeted areas and beneficiaries, and through cash transfer interventions; and (f) secure flexible funding that allows UNICEF to respond to p
riority nee
ds, as necessary. UNICEF will invest an additional effort in strengthening its programme monitoring by UNICEF programme teams and third-party contractors. 

43 The challenges related to programming in the context of COVID have highlighted the importance of community-based programming to ensure that response services are available to the most vulnerable, with a focus on ensuring that community-based management systems are in place. Understanding that COVID related restrictions may need to be in place during 2021, UNICEF recognizes the importance of strengthening partners to strengthen creative solutions to ensure that the most vulnerable children continue to have access to essential basic services, including education and child protection. 

44        Due to the uniqueness of the Libyan context and COVID 19 pandemic, UNICEF faced a number of operational challenges, such as multiple office locations and multiple accommodations arrangements, lock-downs and quarantine arrangements and constant staff movement back and forth between Tunisia and Libya. UNICEF needs to maintain flexible operational arrangements to allow for flexible, rapid increase and decrease as need. 
"
MENAR,"MENARO, Jordan",Lessons Learned and Innovations,"There were significantly more children in need at the end of 2020 than in past years, mainly due to the social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This year called for innovative workarounds and custom solutions from MENARO, including lessons in scaling up digital approaches to education; health systems responses and health continuity of services; increased complex cross-sectoral and interagency partnerships; and operationally addressing the elevated teleworking modalities for staff members. While COVID-19 initially was treated as an emergency, it soon become clear that the situation is far beyond a “normal” emergency with far stretching impact on the way MENARO operates. Lessons learned this year included:
    
With lack of initial clear understanding of the far-reaching impacts of the pandemic, UNICEF’s comparative advantages (e.g. in RCCE) helped the organization to provide a strong initial response. However, despite these efforts, opportunities were missed, including defining a multi-sectoral approach to IPC and taking a clear position on keeping schools open.
At the country level, existing plans and programmes have sometimes hampered the rapid shift necessary, as COs felt bound to deliver on initially agreed upon workplans. Streamlining of planning and programming processes removed initial bottlenecks, as has the flexibility given by the reallocation of regular resources. 
Interagency operational coordination was enhanced in 2020 mainly for COVID response efforts. Engagement with UNHCR has benefitted from the blueprint agreement and better integrated support the refugee populations. These partnerships, including with WHO EMRO, need to be sustained and advanced, and focus on collaboration. 
The pandemic response demonstrated the importance of having built a strong supply community across the region. Early focus on local/regional procurement of PPE supplies allowed MENA region to gap-fill delays due to off-shore shipments complexities, borders closure, freight challenges. 
The onset emergencies this year, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the Beirut explosions created substantial fundraising needs. While UNICEF prioritized the private sector as a source of funds more broadly across the region, the pace at which these emergencies developed pointed to the need to increase private sector capacity in the region. This may mean a tripartite partnership among UNICEF-government-private sector.
Resource mobilization needs to continue to prioritize flexible and predictable funding. Supportive donors need to be given greater recognition.
Globally, RO accountabilities must be clearly spelled out in the current change management process to reflect the balance between support and oversight. Matrix management lines between CO specialists and RO advisers need to be reinforced.
Lines of accountabilities, supporting and leading roles need to be refined between programming planning and humanitarian units, especially on issues of reporting, indicator and target setting, and streamline communication within other thematic units in MENARO and COs.
Staff feedback showed that MENARO quickly and extensively provided a caring environment for staff during remote work. Effective ICT enabled teams to stay connected and gain confidence in remote work. 
However, after the first line of response, MENARO needed to readjust its internal structures and mechanisms, and there is a need to find the right governance for the right balance between inclusiveness, effectiveness and internal communication flow management.
 For 2021-22, MENARO aims at supporting the following shifts:
MENARO can play a role in data/evidence generation around framing and documenting the pandemic impacts on children and lessons learned for future similar events.
Focus areas around gender, domestic violence and mental health need to be addressed in a multi-sectoral way in the continuing COVID response.
RCCE needs to incorporate broader issues beyond prevention, such as restoration of the population’s trust in services, climate responsible behaviour and increased social protection. 
There will be a higher number of vulnerable adolescents and youth in the coming year, as they are at risk of not returning to school. There is an ever-more important need to focus on adolescent and youth learning, skills and employability for this age group, leveraging GenU.
It is necessary to repurpose and repackage mental health and psychosocial support to address impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The “jumpstart package” to equitable access to primary health care for children and mothers, while effectively implemented in 2020, needs to continue well into 2021 to ensure that no child is left behind. With curtailed access to mother and children programming, as well as an increase in children in need, there is a need to scale up and adapt infant and young children feeding programmes and public messaging. 
UNICEF found innovative solutions to tackle malnutrition, including developing a new design of an essential tool for malnutrition screening: the disposable mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) tape. This innovative tape helped ensure the continuity of life-saving nutrition services in countries such as the Syrian Arab Republic, Lebanon, the State of Palestine, Yemen and Sudan. The roll out needs to continue.
UNICEF needs to work with national governments to ensure the prioritization and expansion of social protection systems to reach the most affected children and families including by expanding cash transfer programmes.
Violence and armed conflict continues in far too many countries in the region, and many schools continued to be unsafe for children in this region. Attacks on schools are one of the six grave violations of children’s rights. This region continues to record the highest number of attacks against schools and education facilities, an underlying reality that did not receive its fair share of attention in 2020.
An integrated set of services across health, nutrition, education, WASH, social protection sectors are needed. That is why, UNICEF in close collaboration with WHO, World Bank, the Arab Network for Early Childhood Development and other regional partners mobilized to provide guidance for decision makers on operationalization of the Nurturing Care Framework in humanitarian context. During 2021, this will mean multicounty and national workshops with a selected number of countries that will result with an actionable regional roadmap that prioritizes policy and financing for the holistic development of crisis-affected young children, with a commitment from key stakeholders to implement it."
MENAR,Morocco,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"From early stages of the pandemic, Morocco took quick and appropriate decisions to anticipate the negative effects of this crisis. The Country has thus succeeded in mobilizing important funds (3.4 billion dollars) and in putting in place several mitigation measures in different areas such as health and social protection, including in particular a cash transfer to the benefit of almost 6 million households. 
 
Within  a challenging  international development aid context, UNICEF Morocco succeeded in mobilizing  sufficient resources to support the national response addressing  emerging  needs as well as advocating for the rights of  children affected by the  consequences of the crisis  - the most vulnerable among them and  supported the Government socio economic response,  with emergency social protection schemes for the informal sector and poor/vulnerable households.  
 
As elsewhere, the COVID crisis in Morocco has brought to the surface some systems’ weaknesses;  the timely response  put in place by the Government with a number of  socio economic measures  to  address increasing vulnerabilities  and some of the most acute social fragilities has provided for  an opportunity to contribute and influence further ongoing reform processes while making sure most urgent needs were met to protect children and families particularly those with limited access to information and adequate services. As additional and timely analysis of the COVID  socio-economic impact  is available and  we all gain better knowledge  and understanding of the crisis’  long term  consequences,  and in order to ensure effectiveness and sustainability of  UNICEF supported interventions, the  programming for the remaining of the cycle (end 2021) was  swiftly reviewed  to be adjusted to the ‘new reality’ by integrating  a COVID sensitive approach  across the board. While emergency support may continue to be required, the CO has increasingly integrated COVID secondary impact focus to current programming rather than maintaining a separate and parallel stream of interventions.
 
More specifically, the following lessons learned were integrated to the  current MCO programming  and will serve as a starting point  for the internal and external reflections on the new CPD:
 
-          As the country  faces a  concerning economic recession (negative of  5.8%  and budgetary constraints), it will become harder to advocate for additional investments in  the social sectors including for children;  therefore  refining  and strengthening advocacy strategies at country and regional level  is of paramount importance; the relevance of advocacy strategies can only rely on additional and continued efforts in real time monitoring and evidence gathering. 
 
-          The timely social protection measures implemented  by the Government  benefitting   5.9 million households including  those  in rural and remote areas, have accelerated discussions on the sustainability and expansion of SP schemes in  support of most vulnerable as well as triggered  discussions and options concerning a national universal social protection system sensitive to the impacts on children by extending coverage of the medical insurance scheme and family allowances for all children by 2022-2024. While the SP reform process has been under way for some time, it is key to seize this opportunity to advance rapidly and provide the technical assistance needed in coordination with other partners.
 
-          Digital learning has been and will continue to be instrumental to ensure continuity in the education process for all children, particularly for those most vulnerable school age children, already at risk of dropping out of school. However, distance learning will require a longer-term vision and strategy in order to ensure full and safe back to learning and continuity of education with a particular focus on reaching out to those at risk of exclusion. ITo ensure no one is left behind a mix of online and offline strategies may be required;  adjustment of curricula to the new learning environment, appropriate monitoring  and supporting systems  should be in place and better outreach; investing in the capacity of teachers to manage and provide quality to their work under very different circumstances should be a priority.  
 
-          The COVID crisis  has been an opportunity to facilitate the strategic positioning of C4D, the  understanding of behavioral changes and  the role of  community engagement to behavioral change. The experience gained so far and the  C4D/RCCE initiatives put in place together with Government partners and civils society  have demonstrated the centrality of this approach to the COVID response; it becomes therefore imperative to capitalize on these gains,  reinforce community based interventions,  and apply more innovative approaches and platforms;  
 
-          The involvement of civil society and their readiness to support  local authorities has been key to  the COVID response and  has shown the strategic importance of  strengthening this partnership  and their role  as service providers for the state , in coordination  with subnational actors. As we move ahead, investing efforts in formalizing and strengthening this compact is of strategic importance, making sure the modality of work does not remain limited to times of crisis and ad hoc arrangements. 
 
-          Emergency initiatives in response to the protection of the most vulnerable children have been the opportunity to pilot elements of the child protection system reform, such as alternative care for children without parental care, street children, migrant children. The decision to close for security reasons some of the residential institutions and centers for vulnerable/ in contact with the law children or  replace children in detention  and reintegrate these children either back to their family with  the required support has shown the feasibility and the socio-economic value of such approach. These initiatives are excellent evidence in order to influence the course of the reform and provide options to the practice of judges.  
 
-          The crisis is clearly providing additional evidence and justification to the importance of investing in PHC services, strengthening the capacity of health human capital and accelerating the modelling of community based health systems. 
 
-          Finally, this global crisis has shown in the case of Morocco the importance of emergency preparedness and the need to include crisis management throughout the decentralization reform and the specific needs of each region and age groups.

"
MENAR,Oman,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"While COVID-19 brought about significant challenges to programming in-country due to lockdown, and led to the disruption of access to much-needed services (including learning and protection), it also created opportunities for UNICEF Oman to work in a high-income context in innovative ways and lay the foundations for accelerating results of existing initiatives.  Support for development of guidelines for the safe return of children to ECD facilities and nursery schools, support for RCCE and strategic Government communications in the area of COVID-19, as well as support in the area of PF4C, highlighted UNICEF’s strategic and technical relevance in a high-income context and has won UNICEF Oman considerable regard from the Government  
 
1.       Emerging priorities under the COVID-19 response allowed UNICEF Oman to strengthen institutional structures that will have a lasting positive impact.
 
UNICEF Oman was able to link work under the COVID-19 response with ongoing long-term strategic initiatives to ensure enduring positive results for children, beyond the pandemic. For example, work to re-open ECD facilities and nursery schools built on the IECD model for service delivery that the office supported in 2019 and which was validated by the Government. The IECD model advocates for the establishment of a system of regulations to ensure that the quality of services offered in ECD facilities meets agreed standards and that these are consistently monitored, regardless of geography or sector. To achieve this, a strong governance and monitoring structure must be in place. In developing the guidelines, UNICEF was able to strengthen approaches and structures to accelerate the implementation of the IECD model.  
 
The re-opening guidelines provide clear directions for ECD staff and outline their responsibilities to operate facilities safely and minimise the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Taking a holistic approach and with the aim of upgrading existing standards, the SOPs also consider the multi-faceted impacts on young children, especially the most vulnerable, and the support that may be required in relation to protection, psycho-social assistance, health, and other issues that may emerge and need to be   addressed due to COVID-19 confinement measures. This approach will be of benefit to children’s development, beyond the pandemic, as facilities take a more comprehensive approach to child-wellbeing. 
 
Meanwhile, the work has contributed to the building of institutional capacity at the Ministry of Social Development, which oversees this sector. Monitoring systems, including the creation of sub-national teams, monitoring tools and regular monitoring milestones, were established. Gains made towards strengthened monitoring systems for ECD facilities and nursery schools as a result of the safe re-opening work are key to enhanced ECD services in country going forward. Ongoing capacity-building efforts in this area will also contribute to this. 
 
2.       COVID-19 has provided UNICEF Oman with an opportunity to engage further in the PF4C space as safeguarding investment in child-related services, with the aim of supporting human capital formation, has become all the more important.
 
UNICEF Oman engagement in PF4C work comes at an opportune moment. Vision 2040, which the government will start to implement in 2021, sets out the ambition for a future with a diversified economy with decreased reliance on hydrocarbons and highly developed human capital. This work has become even more relevant given the new economic realities characterized by the crash in oil prices and the impact of COVID-19 control measures, compounded by the global economic slowdown. 
 
Government buy-in for this work has grown since the start of the pandemic. The Government views UNICEF Oman’s economic analysis and FSA work as an opportunity to assess the impact of COVID-19 on social services and explore opportunities to bridge the funding gaps in priority areas – early child development, children with disabilities, youth programming, and social protection – that are in line with the national development plan.
 
3.       The pandemic re-enforced the need to strengthen cross-sectoral collaboration. This is expected to strengthen cross-sectoral programming going forward.
 
The pandemic re-enforced the need for close coordination to allow for a quick scale-up of the COVID-19 response, and to ensure guidelines, approaches and communication are aligned across sectors. At the national level, the Government established the Supreme Committee for the Prevention of COVID-19, with which UNICEF Oman engaged closely to ensure tailored and contextualized programming.
 
At the level of the UNICEF Oman Programme, the Programme Management Group (PMG), comprised of representatives from the ministries of education, health, social development, and the National Centre for Statistics and Information, acts as a steering committee. The PMG continues to be instrumental in resolving many obstacles in programme implementation. It has also promoted more efficient cross-sectoral linkages and facilitated the endorsement of more progressive interventions. The establishment of the SBCC Task Force, under the PMG, to support cross-sectoral implementation of RCCE strategies and creation of the ForOmansChildren hashtag, as part of a national campaign, helped deepen existing relationships and encouraged closer cooperation. It also helped to expand engagement of new partners – as such the Ministry of Information may be considered as the lead partner for UNICEF Oman in its advocacy and communication efforts going forward. The establishment of the Task Force, for which terms of reference were developed and validated, will ensure that SBCC work beyond COVID-19 is coordinated across sectors to ensure maximum impact and synergies. 
 
Similarly, the expansion of partnerships under the PF4C programme is considered a positive step. During the reporting period, a concrete PF4C partnership with the Ministry of Finance and relevant line ministries was established. As noted above, the Government, particularly the Ministry of Finance, recognizes UNICEF Oman as a strong partner, with an important role to play in evidence-backed advocacy for the protection of social sector services delivery.
 
4.       Community Engagement (two-way feedback mechanism)  
Social media channels have provided a space for the community to engage with the Government. And it has become apparent, especially over the course of 2020, that there is a huge appetite to engage not only with Government but with agencies such as UNICEF. This is an important opportunity to increasingly engage with the general public and establish feedback mechanisms to feed their perspectives into programming. 
 

"
MENAR,"Palestine, State of",Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The scale and nature of the COVID-19 crisis required innovation, and a system-wide and multi-sectoral scale-up with strong inter-ministerial coordination between the MoE, MoH, and MoSD to respond holistically to children’s needs. During the COVID response UNICEF supported the PA, development and humanitarian partners across the nexus for policy and capacity development and systems strengthening at national and sub-national levels. Examples of innovations and lessons learnt included:
·       UNICEF supported Government and NGO partners to build their capacity for remote service provision and capacity building. Virtual approaches proved challenging such as the education system where there was insufficient appropriate infrastructure for distance learning, and teachers were not adequately prepared to provide remote learning. UNICEF partnered with UNESCO to strengthen the distance learning system through innovative ways, particularly to ensure learning continuity for marginalized children without internet access including through procurement of devices and tablets loaded with offline interactive self-learning materials. The MoE was provided with zoom to support all school counselors' training on MHPSS provision to children. Nevertheless, remote service provision has remained a challenge across sectors, and in the Child Protection sector COVID-19 highlighted the need to train personnel to find ways to reach most vulnerable children who do not have electronic devices to communicate with service providers.
·       UNICEF supported the first virtual Hack-a-Thon in SoP, engaging 1,000 young people in designing technology solutions to overcome COVID-19 challenges in their communities. Following the Hack-a-Thon, a feedback mechanism platform was established to address misinformation, mistrust, and conspiracy theories which the inter-agency RCCE task force will draw from to shape messages and the vaccination effort. Following the Hack-a-Thon UNICEF also implemented virtual psychosocial support activities for children through digitalized stories and songs, reaching over half a million people that encourage and stimulate families to play with their children.
 
In partnership with WFP, an INGO, and partners, UNICEF supported the MoH in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip to develop the National Nutrition Protocol for women, adolescents, and children. The Protocol will be finalized at the beginning of 2021, becoming the first national nutrition protocol agreed upon by all partners operating in the State of Palestine. In 2020, UNICEF and WFP jointly supported the introduction of an innovative complementary feeding bowl to reach the most vulnerable, the two agencies supported the MOH to develop an action plan to roll out of this initiative in 2021, targeting 16,000 families in the West Bank and Gaza. Furthermore, the Nutrition Friendly School Initiative (NFSI) pilot targets school children with a focus on empowering disadvantaged adolescent girls to improve their well-being, with multiplier effects for their families, communities and societies. The prioritization of nutrition as an issue in the SoP across the programme cycle was validated by the MICS findings which found that 8.7 percent of children under the age of five years in Palestine suffer from moderate and severe stunting (SDG indicator 2.2.1). This has worsened since the 2014 MICS when stunting was at 7.4 percent. UNICEF will continue working with WFP to strengthen the national nutrition system to ensure the delivery of a package of essential nutrition interventions to prevent malnutrition among the most vulnerable women and children.
 
The lack of sufficient and sustained funds and resources for operations and maintenance (O&M) of WASH facilities and the lack of sufficient electricity supply in Gaza remain critical challenges to the WASH programme's impact. Funding and resources for O&M of WASH infrastructure was constrained by the absence of an effective cost recovery system and appropriate tariff structure and operational and management plans were absent or inadequate. The water utilities face a vicious cycle of poor services leading to water users searching for quality services elsewhere, and therefore refusing to pay the fees. The Gazan population’s lack of trust in the quality of water provided through the piped water system remains a critical barrier to cost recovery efforts there, despite the increased provision of desalinated water. Both factors were highlighted in the 2020 evaluation of the UNICEF WASH program. These key constraints challenge the UNICEF WASH Theory of Change and demand innovative approaches. Accordingly, UNICEF will redouble efforts in 2021 to mobilize resources for O&M and will undertake community engagement activities in the areas covered by the Southern Gaza Desalination Plant.
 
A siloed sectoral approach to addressing Violence Against Children (VAC) has limited potential for sustained national impact due to the limited coverage. The National Intersectoral Violence Against Children (NIVAC) strategy avoided this by bringing together the MOSD to reduce violence in households and communities, the MOEHE in schools, and the MoH through Primary Health Care service delivery sites. This intersectoral convergence and effort to mainstream VAC priorities into the respective sectoral strategies is likely to leverage sustained achievement of reduced violence levels. The 2020 Child Protection Mapping Review identified strengths and gaps in the social welfare system in support of the NIVAC Strategy finalization.
 
As an innovation for the office, UNICEF is working with an INGO to build national implementing partners' capacity on Accountability to Affected Populations focused on community feedback mechanisms. As part of this capacity-building project, UNICEF is leveraging a previous project funded by the Humanitarian Innovation Fund under which an AAP data and information handling system was developed. This system, which will be offered to UNICEF implementing partners, would allow them to categorize feedback and manage that feedback until it is closed following an adequate response to individuals especially to women and girls. This AAP initiative is also planned to strengthen the UNICEF system for the Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) through cohesive community engagement and response systems. UNICEF is now co-leading the inter-agency PSEA network with OCHA to embed PSEA as an operational concept across humanitarian agencies in the SoP.
 
As the National Policy Agenda of the Palestinian Authority was extended to 2017-2023, UNICEF will consider extending the Area Programme Document to 2023. In 2021 the office will start developing the new programme cycle taking into consideration a new situation analysis of children in the State of Palestine.

"
MENAR,Saudi Arabia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The 2019-2023 sub-regional programme called for a deepened engagement through two approaches: firstly, to more substantively engage with national partners to development priorities of the countries as reflected in the focus on early childhood development, child protection, and data for children, and secondly, to strengthen partnerships with public and private actors in the Gulf to jointly advance child rights in the region and around the world. 
 
To realize these ambitions, UNICEF GAO began implementation of a new operational model responsive to the high-income country context with an expanded physical presence in the sub-region, the onboarding of pooled senior technical expertise, and increased staffing capacity to identify, cultivate, and sustain public and private partnerships. 
 
UNICEF GAO can draw some immediate lessons on its model programmatic engagement and partnerships to date:
 
·       The “universality” of the pandemic reaffirmed the breadth of UNICEF’s potential role and contribution in the Gulf. UNICEF’s programme priorities around child protection, and the prevention and response to violence, early childhood development and shoring up data and evidence on children were more acutely relevant during a year in which schools were largely closed from March to the end of the year and families experienced extended lockdowns. With a robust public health response to the pandemic, UNICEF was able to immediately focus on advocacy and generating national attention towards the secondary impacts of the crisis by leveraging its programme priorities. More specifically: supporting governments and related partners in responding to violence in the home, addressing mental well-being across a spectrum, responding to disruptions to services for children such as hotlines, and supporting teachers, learners and caregivers with virtual learning were routinely addressed with partners. UNICEF was less effective in engaging in dialogue with national counterparts on the degree to which the range of large-scale social policy programme rolled out across the sub-region targeted children and the most vulnerable households. UNICEF will soon recruit technical capacity to address this gap. Overall, the increased engagement heightened by the pandemic resulted in improved funding for programmes and further positioned UNICEF as a leading voice for children.
·       The pandemic also introduced new programmatic areas of importance to national partners which were not defined in the sub-regional programme, the most important of which was enhancing education across the first and second decade. The programme focused on issues requiring integrated and whole-of-society responses noting that the countries of the Gulf are well resourced to deliver quality social services. However, with the world using the disruption in education to modernize and reform the sector, there were significant opportunities for technical support, partnership, and experience sharing. This included focusing on equipping parents and families with a range of concerns related to the quality of early childhood education, virtual learning, ensuring the continuation of child protection services ordinarily offered in schools, and addressing safety and the empowerment of children online. Tools such as MENARO’s interactive TPTP – with its focus on mental health and teacher support to distance and hybrid learning – enabled UNICEF the opportunity to offer practical, timely, and relevant technical support to ministries of education and education actors.  On-going consultations with ministries of education are focused on early childhood education, access to learning for vulnerable children, and education attuned to the 21st century. 
·       UNICEF GAO worked more substantively with UN Country Teams to jointly contribute to emerging issues. All country teams established or reinvigorated UN Migration Networks which were served as a useful platform to share technical expertise and to engage with Government jointly on the implementation of the Global Compact on Migration.  UNICEF’s role has been to focus on how migration affects children and the specialized services they require, highlighting this in joint proposals to Government (KSA) and presenting on the situation of children in Kuwait’s first multi-stakeholder consultation led by the UN in Kuwait.
·       UNICEF GAO continues to also analyze strategies that are most effective in providing relevant technical support in the Gulf. Programme experiences that can be readily shared from other high-income countries are valued by national counterparts to inform their programme and policy design. Therefore, the availability of tools, packages and guidance adapted to high income countries is priority. Global lessons learned on the use of technology, communication platforms such as social media, and innovation to deliver programme results are increasingly sought given the region’s highly connected populations presenting key considerations for communication and behavior change programming in the coming year. Given the range of new issues coming to the forefront as a result of the COVID-19, the Gulf countries remain committed to contributing to global public goods and thought leadership in topics such as the future of education (as exemplified by the UAE’s RewirEdX conference and the KSA’s thematic workshops for the G-20). 
·       The dual impact of the pandemic and declining oil revenue challenged fundraising and partnership efforts from the region. To mitigate these constraints, UNICEF employed a variety of strategies, including virtual events such as field tours to keep partners aware of emerging and pressing needs globally, provided opportunities for interaction between UNICEF’s senior leadership and high level decision-makers in the Gulf, and engaged with international financial institutions such as the Islamic Development Bank leveraging UNICEF’s strengths of global field presence and capacities as an implementing partner. UNICEF recognizes that these virtual modes for convening and communicating will likely be sustained in the medium term and that it must continue to show agility and flexibility in collaborating with public and private partners. 
UNICEF GAO’s additional technical expertise in all its programme and partnership result areas were instrumental in responding to heightened technical support requests as a result of the pandemic. UNICEF staff were active and engaged in country level advocacy opportunities, reducing the need to rely on regional and headquarter staff substantially. There is opportunity to leverage this further, with Gulf based public and private sectors increasingly interested in supporting the child development agenda in their own countries, UNICEF is better positioned to be more responsive with relevant proposals for partnership and joint advocacy
"
MENAR,Sudan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In 2020’s complex operating environment, UNICEF’s flexibility and creativity provided solutions for high impact interventions. UNICEF strongly advocated for the mobilization of domestic resources to meet the shortfall for the first round of the national polio vaccination campaign and the mass distribution of LLINs.  The Sudanese government allocated resources of around USD $5.6 million, as UNICEF agreed to transfer the campaign funds in US dollars.  Donor flexibility and availability of critical pre-positioned supplies remain key to a timely response to ongoing humanitarian situations in Sudan.
 
Learning from the Ebola experience and keeping a child-centered focus on its response, UNICEF engaged partners to warn of the greater risks to children from the indirect impact of COVID-19 than from the disease itself.  UNICEF advocated for the need for prioritization of critical services during the COVID-19 response. Support for the development of guidelines and adherence to mitigation measures ensured that all frontline workers were protected during the delivery of interventions. UNICEF also highlighted the need for innovative approaches – increasing the number of service days to stagger caseloads, single child use of MUAC tapes,  increasing the RUTF quota to cover two weeks supply for children instead of weekly etc. to support the continued provision of integrated services for both children and their caregivers and promoted an integrated, multi-sectoral approach to ensure access to healthcare and essential services at the targeted health facilities. This approach covered all child protection measures including psychosocial support and gender-based violence interventions. 
 
In education, these approaches enabled continuity of children’s learning, physical and psychological health and well-being. The innovations build on a mix of self- and teacher- supported student learning, through various media channels/online solutions which were accessible to the most marginalized children; especially those without internet access or living remote areas or camp settings. The “Can’t Wait to Learn” project for non-formal education, targeted the OOSC in remote areas and nomadic communities with the provision of innovative at-scale learning (formal and non-formal) for the most vulnerable groups in Sudan.  
The programme provided review classes for Grade 8 and 11 through TV, radio, internet or paper-based booklets, supporting the continuity of learning during the pandemic and has the potential to support the remote delivery of instructions and teacher training programmes.
 
The need to adhere to COVID-19 protocols offered an opportunity for children from the Khalwas (Qur’anic Schools) to be released and reunified with their families and communities. Family tracing and reunification with appropriate alternative care arrangements focused on children aged 5-12 years old, especially girls. Many child offenders, mainly those children living and working on the street, were diverted outside the judicial system and put on a family tracing and reunification plan. 
With UNICEF Sudan’s long-standing national presence, knowledge and expertise of the WASH sector in particular, UNICEF is increasingly called upon by the government to advise on the reform agenda and sector priorities, which offers an opportunity to ensure that vulnerable children are at the center of policies and programmes. To realize SDG-6 targets for Sudan, coordination among the humanitarian and developmental actors is vital. There is an appetite for a single coordination mechanism that unites and integrates the humanitarian and development actors together under a common “SDG-6 forum” to achieve synergy and high-level commitment.
COVID-19 has demonstrated the resourcefulness of young people in finding scalable solutions to current issues; increased youth engagement presents a good opportunity to accelerate progress in access to WASH services.  Low cost solar handpumps that were successfully piloted in 2019 gained acceptance from communities and government. Innovative hand-free handwashing stations, locally designed using the local materials, were widely used to combat COVID-19.  An innovative RapidPro based real-time monitoring system was piloted for ODF and water functionality. However, powerful IMS systems need to be well institutionalized for success.  
 
High staff turnover, inadequate arrangements and resources to exercise remote working modalities for government staff was a major challenge in 2020 and negatively affected programme implementation. SCO stepped up its technical and capacity-building support to the government through focused capacity building programmes, and advocated for continuity of staff for key functions. 
 
UNICEF engaged technical experts such as the Economic Policy Research Institute (EPRI) and the Partnership for Economic Policy (PEP), to provide quality social protection policy advisory services and build capacity. Collaboration with the Economic and Social Research Bureau highlighted the need to improve our partnership with academic institutions. UNICEF also seconded GIS expertise to the FMoH which helped in mapping confirmed COVID-19 cases and fostered improved surveillance, contact tracing activities and reinforced lockdown measures.  
 
The limited availability of up-to-date data remains a major constraint for evidence-based policy and program formulation. The current economic crisis presents a significant challenge to reach children and families with fewer resources.
 
Given the recurring nature of emergencies, the importance of emergency preparedness needs continued emphasis. Pre-positioned emergency supplies and seed money were available, allowing UNICEF to respond promptly to the multiple emergencies such as floods and the Ethiopian refugees humanitarian response.  Emergency interventions such as blanket disinfection of all water sources is key not only during emergency, but also during routine daily water supply operations to sustain the quality of the domestic water and prevent epidemics.
 
Adolescents and youth leading the political change highlighted the need for focusing on empowering children and their participation early in programme design; implementation and monitoring has added real value to programme efficiency and effectiveness. Youth are also critical change agents for promoting peace and for conflict sensitive programming.
 
As part of its reform agenda the transitional government committed to increasing investment in the education sector which presents an opportunity for investing in the quality of education including teacher professional development, infrastructure and school grants. The MoE increased salaries of teachers and school grants will be extended to all schools from the GPE grant. UNICEF is taking advantage from the curriculum reform underway to include child rights concepts within the new curriculum.
"
MENAR,Syria,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF Syria Country Office (SCO) contributed to the global evaluation of UNICEF's work for children in cities led by the Evaluation Office. The WASH programme, specifically its network rehabilitation model in humanitarian context, was selected as a case study.

The case study concluded that the model has been key to ensuring equitable access to water and sanitation services, linking humanitarian efforts to longer-term sustainable results by building on pre-existing water and sewerage networks in urban areas and focusing on strengthening the capacity of local service providers for better management of these services. The use of severity scalesto identify those in need, both by geographical location and by indicators, highlights the type of intervention needed by the most vulnerable. The case study also noted that “UNICEF leadership has earned the organization credibility within the local government, which has been instrumental in facilitating access to hard-to-reach areas”, and also “facilitated strong inter-sectoral coordination with other entities, contributing to the overall effectiveness of the model”.

SCO also completed the evaluation of Back to Learning initiative in Syria. Key findings included that the population receives information about schooling directly from schools and the directorates of education, and people were aware of the benefits of education in general. This calls for the need to refocus the messaging of the community mobilization and communication campaign and prioritize emerging challenges such as non-formal education and preventing dropouts. The evaluation also concluded that “the challenge of bringing children back to learning in Syria remains with the education supply side” and “strengthening resilience and community systems approach to enhance enrolment and retention is critical” to reduce the number of children out of school and to ensure that every child can learn in a good quality system.

Both evaluations suggest a need for stronger links between humanitarian action and more sustainable results, as well as the need to strengthen resilience building on existing systems at community levels. Experiences from nationwide campaigns on immunization and back-to-school efforts also highlight the importance of mobilizing government systems and networks at community levels to achieve widespread reach. Furthermore, emerging threats, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrate the need for a systematic approach to overcome society-wide challenges and to reach out to vulnerable children at scale. It is of utmost importance for UNICEF, and the UN in general, to find a balance in ensuring effective and equitable support at scale to the most vulnerable children and communities in the complex and sensitive context.

Considering the prioritized attention to the COVID-19 response this year, SCO conducted a light After Action Review to re-evaluate learning and identify immediate corrective actions to improve the response. Lessons included that existing mechanisms and platforms greatly contributed to the timely coordination and response, such as the UN Humanitarian Country Team and the implementation of the MoH’s Preparedness and Response Plan supported by UNICEF and WHO. Furthermore, the SCO’s initial focus on the continued primary health services at community level, combined with advocacy and specific guidance, was found relevant and appropriate. Finally, it was noted that, while management called for continued humanitarian action and response, staff safety and duty of care were equally prioritized.

SCO, in close coordination with the Regional Director, Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, other UN agencies and Regional Office, continued to advocate with the government on various issues, such as for greater access to data and evidence. This has led to consent from the government to initiate discussions towards conducting a multiple indicator cluster survey (MICS), a household survey that covers a variety of topics, focusing on issues that directly affect the lives of children and women. With previous MICS conducted in 2006, the next round will provide valuable, updated data on children and women. Discussions are ongoing with the Central Bureau of Statistics at the time of reporting. Towards the last quarter of 2020, complex child protection issues and access to quality and accredited education and water were addressed at senior levels, including the issue of Alouk water station and other options in northeast Syria to find a longer term approach and more sustainable solutions.

While the COVID-19 pandemic caused unprecedented challenges, it also presented an opportunity. Capitalizing on the discussions around the United Nations Strategic Framework as well as the Inter-agency Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of COVID-19, UNICEF worked closely with sister agencies, namely UNDP, UNFPA and WFP, to develop a vision paper for an improved, coordinated and integrated social protection system in Syria. While the paper is being finalized at the time of reporting, it lays out three pillars for possible UN support, namely, (1) policy development and institutional capacity development; (2) programme design, integration and administrative reforms; and (3) service delivery and community engagement. As an immediate way forward, the participating agencies agreed to conduct a mapping exercise to better understand existing programmes and initiatives, as well as capacities, opportunities and gaps. This mapping will inform a refined scope of the UN and UN Country Team engagement on enhanced social protection in Syria for 2021 and beyond.

"
MENAR,Tunisia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Around the globe and in Tunisia the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing regional and socio-economic disparities, exposing the weaknesses in preparedness and response capacities. In this difficult context, however, UNICEF earlier research and advocacy work became particularly relevant, and data and evidence produced in recent years proved critical to address key areas of gaps. Evidence on the status of the cold chain system for example, which had received little attention and difficult to finalize in 2019, proved critical in the preparation for the COVID-19 vaccine introduction, providing key and up to date information for the COVID-19 Vaccine Introduction Readiness Assessment Tool (VIRAT). UNICEF support to the process over the past two years also provided a unique position to support the government and leverage partnerships and resources in the COVID-19 vaccine preparedness and response plan alongside strengthening routine immunization in Tunisia. UNICEF will continue to advocate for a system strengthening approach through this process. 
 
Similarly, UNICEF worked closely with the Ministry of Social Affairs over the past three years to generate evidence on how to address poverty amongst children, supporting the development of a social protection floor and a universal child grant (UCG), a proposed law and decree for which was tabled to parliament end 2019. Already, changes to improve the equity of the existing social protection system were approved in May 2020, suppressing the ceiling on the number (up to 3 children) and age of children (older than 5 years), ensuring more equity for children and families’ beneficiaries. Based on existing knowledge and relationships - including support for three key studies on this topic in close partnership with government officials - UNICEF was uniquely positioned to mobilise partnerships and resources for the anticipated implementation of a UCG for children from Tunisia’s poorest and most vulnerable households. Whilst mitigating the impacts of COVID-19 on children, this support serves as an interim bridge measure until the approval of the draft law for a social protection floor and UCG by parliament. Although the draft law foresees a payment of 10 TND/month/child for all children from poor households, the programme supports a 30 TND/month/child for all 0-5 year old children from the poorest and most vulnerable households, in line with evidence produced through the cost-benefit, impact and feasibility study supported by UNICEF. By implementing the recommended amount for a UCG into practice for children under the age of 5 registered under Tunisia’s existing social protection programmes, the programme intends to create the field evidence supporting government take-up.
The COVID-19 pandemic also enabled UNICEF to raise the profile and Government interest in areas supported by the UNICEF programme and not earlier prioritised. As a result of the COVID-19 crisis, for instance, the government made the prevention of, and response to, school drop-out a national priority, and revealed the need for better planning, adaptation and quality education, and as such may represent a turning point for long overdue reforms in the education sector. The COVID-19 crisis required a much closer participation of parents in their children’s learning, reinforcing the importance of the ECD positive parenting programme UNICEF supported in 2019. In the area of child protection, the COVID-19 crisis presented an opportunity for UNICEF to advocate for social services for vulnerable children and address gaps in terms of accessibility and quality of services and improving multisectoral coordination. In the area of WASH, UNICEF had been supporting since 2016 the rehabilitation of WASH infrastructure and hygiene practices in schools, with a focus on most vulnerable regions. As part of this effort, UNICEF supported upgrading of standards for WASH in schools – adapted to the specific needs of girls and boys and taking into account the realities on the ground. The relevance of this programme significantly increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Over 10,000 children had been trained on hand-washing practices just before the COVID-19 outbreak. WASH infrastructure in 21 schools, benefiting 8,431 children, had been finalized in time for the back to school in 2020, enabling a safer return to school of these children in the COVID-19 context.  The work carried out with UNICEF’s support in this area placed UNICEF in a unique position to mobilize funds for small repairs and fixes in over 150 schools, and to undertake a full-scale needs assessment at country-level for WASH in schools.  
 
Finally, UNICEF was able to leverage the SITAN methodology in its policy dialogue with government and partners. Structured around the progress and challenges towards the achievement of SDGs, the SITAN presented an important advocacy opportunity, and was widely taken up by the Government, media and partners alike. Clearly identifying and communicating gaps in the realization of child rights in line with the SDGs and its indicators framework offered an important entry point, easy to communicate to all stakeholders and aligned to the national SDG policy agenda. A light review of the SITAN to integrate the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic across the different areas ensured the continued relevance of the document following the crisis. The alignment of the SITAN with the SDG framework also facilitated UNICEF efforts to ensure a child sensitive UNSDCF. 

"
MENAR,Yemen,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Access to credible and up-to-date information is a significant challenge in Yemen that requires the use of innovative data collection and analysis instruments.  In 2020, UNICEF engaged in several knowledge management initiatives and studies to generate    evidence for better programming. 

With ongoing inability to conduct population-based and nationally representative surveys resulting in the need to explore alternative modalities for estimating access, coverage, and effectiveness; a novel geospatial analysis of access to health services was conducted jointly by UNICEF, WHO, and the World Bank and revealed variation between access to primary health care facilities and services. The analysis helped to build the case for the importance of targeted planning of outreach, mobile, and community-based services to fill access gaps. 

A collaboration with the Boston University resulted in mathematical models that estimate coverage and gaps in treatment services for children under five with diarrhea and produced refined estimates of children suffering from severe acute malnutrition. These studies provided    proof-of-concept for innovative methodologies to generate information    needed for program strategy and planning in the absence of a quality    high-functioning health information system and population-based surveys. 

In 2020, children and community members were greatly affected by education services disruptions, delayed implementation of planned activities, interrupted on-site monitoring and prolonged school closures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This unprecedented crisis accelerated the development, deployment and implementation of technological solutions that support and strengthen service delivery, monitoring, and communication with beneficiaries. To that end, UNICEF supported the design of remote learning for all children during school closures through different innovative    alternative learning programmes, Safe School Protocols, and provision of PPEs.  

Under the Child Protection programme, case management processes through mobile phones worked well in ensuring continuity of services for the most vulnerable children. Hotlines and digital platforms have helped UNICEF to overcome access challenges including reaching hard-to-reach areas and overcoming access/movement restriction under COVID-19. The importance of multi-sectoral approaches for protection programming is highlighted as an important lesson learned in 2020. Multi-sectoral approach gives wider entry points to address culturally sensitive issues of protection, reaching    higher number of children with less cost. Programmes through health, education and emergency cash transfer has been identified as promising entry points for protection activities. 

In 2020, the office separated the evaluation function in its office from Planning, Monitoring, and Research, and hired a dedicated Evaluation Specialist to boost evaluation use in the YCO. The office also developed plans for three independent, external evaluations: the Community Management of Acute Malnutrition Programme; the Infant and Young Child Feeding Programme; and the WASH Cholera Rapid Response Teams These evaluations will carry over into 2021.

Gender Programmatic Review 

In June 2020, the office completed a Gender Programmatic Review (GPR). The GPR was used to inform adjustments of programme priorities and the new programme Results Framework for 2021/2022. The GPR detailed recommendations by sector, which UNICEF is taking forward to improve alignment with, and contribution to, the global Gender Action Plan. Specifically, the GPR recommends prioritizing the recruitment of a Gender Specialist to enhance    gender mainstreaming in programmes. 

Risk Management 

As part of its efforts to strengthen risk management, UNICEF continued to  implement recommendations from the 2019 Office of Internal Audit and Investigation’s internal audit report. UNICEF implemented the enhanced Harmonised Approach    to Cash Transfers (HACT Plus) to effectively deliver for children in a highly challenging and complex environment. HACT Plus is a risk management framework that goes beyond the regular HACT framework adopted along with other UN agencies. HACT Plus transcends the minimum prescribed assurance activities in HACT, a decision that is determined by the inherent risk exposure and operating environment. As of 31 December 2020, 140 out of 223 implementing partners had been re-assessed to establish their revised risk profiles    using the enhanced risk assessment methodology. Additionally, 40 onsite    financial reviews had been completed while 56 were ongoing.  A total of 74 HACT financial audits were also ongoing. These financial reviews are based on the revised financial    assurance ToRs with an increased focus on fraud detection and prevention.  Additional measurements put in placed include: 

 - Limiting direct cash advances to partners to the minimum possible by    increasing the use of direct payment and reimbursement;

- Direct management and oversight by UNICEF of all procurement, rehabilitation    and construction activities rather than delegating to implementing    partners;

- Introduction of a partnership review mechanism for all government    counterpart funded projects; and 

- Establishment of a Risk Management Taskforce charged with reviewing all    new programme activities in order to ensure cost-effectiveness,    risk-informed decisions and efficiency of the activities to be implemented.    

Programme Monitoring 

In 2020, UNICEF rolled-out a comprehensive Monitoring Framework that    provided overall guidance to the office to ensure programme monitoring is    conducted in a systematic manner that generates quality monitoring information and data for programme analysis, thus facilitating decision-making and corrective actions in programming. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, further restrictions of travel and movements around the country further limited and constrained field monitoring by staff. To ensure continuity of field monitoring activities, UNICEF Yemen employed Remote Monitoring as an approach within the YCO Monitoring Framework.

Looking ahead 

In June 2020, the office convened a two-day online Strategic Moment of Reflection as a critical milestone in the process to develop a new programming framework along with a results and resources matrix for a two-year extension of the Country Programme for 2021 and 2022. This will be    the fifth extension of the country programme which commenced in 2012. Whilst the current dynamic political situation does not allow for a new Country Programme to be prepared, the new Results Framework developed for 2021/2022 strategically positions UNICEF to stay relevant and transition to a sharper programmatic focus to maximize sustained results for children. 

In the absence of a United Nations Sustainable Development Corporation    Framework, in 2021, the UN Country Team will implement the “Strategic Framework for an immediate socio-economic response to COVID-19 in Yemen (2020-2021)” as the rallying point for UN programming in Yemen. In 2021, an implementation plan for this framework will be developed. 
"
SAR,Afghanistan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In line with UNICEF’s commitment to reach every child, ACO established two new outposts in Tirinkot (Uruzgan) and Lashkar Gah (Helmand). By communicating UNICEF’s focus on the provision of assistance to children and women based on the humanitarian principles, irrespective of the territory in which they reside, ACO was able to negotiate access to implement outreach vaccination activities for EPI and Polio, as well as the opening of 580 new CBE classes in Kandahar, Uruzgan, and Helmand provinces. 
COVID-19 has brought about many disruptions in ACO programming but it also brought about valuable lessons and encouraged more out-of-the-box thinking. The use of Polio assets in the areas of communication, social mobilization and supply facilitated the rapid roll out of a multisectoral response to COVID-19.  Integrating the polio program into the fight against COVID-19 meant that teams could be deployed whether at the call centre, in health facilities or directly in camps, getting life-saving messages out rapidly. 
It has been found that providing a higher level of service for rural water supply, where people benefit from household level connections and pay for the service, has proved more effective for the ongoing operation and maintenance (O&M) of those systems, and therefore more sustainable than the traditional, and basic service supported previously (i.e. communal boreholes with handpumps).  Focusing on delivery of safely managed drinking water services at scale in rural areas including water quality testing and the provision of O&M on the job training for all new water supply systems, has helped to strengthen the quality and sustainability of WASH service delivery.
UNICEF initiated a simplified treatment protocol in 2019 which continued during 2020 which recommends a revised dosage for RUTF prescription. Overall analysis has been positive with performance indicators (cure, default, death and non-cure rates) including length of stay remaining same as standard protocol.  Formal research is recommended to ensure effectiveness prior to scaling up. 
 
In order to improve coverage and quality of nutrition and health services for women of reproductive age, pregnant women and children under five, UNICEF is implementing a pilot project in two provinces. The 4C’s approach is aimed at integrating CBNP, Community Based New-born Care (CBNC), Community Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) and Communication for Development (C4D). The approach focuses on upskilling change agents who are in direct contact with women and children to improve the behaviour by women and the lives of over 100,000 children. 
School closures due to the COVID-19 presented an opportunity to test innovative learning-teaching methods such as distance, small group, and self-learning. However, given the limited access to TV or internet in the country, the COVID-19 response had to be tailored to each province and district. The response plan, with a focus on strengthening multisectoral approaches (Education, WASH, Child Protection) can be adapted and used for other humanitarian crisis. 
A virtual field visit was conducted for the first time in Kandahar for UNICEF USA demonstrating an innovative way to showcase the dire situation of children; UNICEF’s programmatic response; and encourage fundraising.
The piloting of cash assistance during the COVID-19 crisis posed several challenges, including the quality of data required to identify the most vulnerable, the cash distribution process, and post distribution monitoring. To this end, UNICEF developed guidance notes and SOPs for cash programming to ensure safeguards are put in place. Further, ACO has volunteered to be a pilot country for the UNICEF global cash programming management information system. Some of the tools being developed have been adopted already as part of the preparation for the pilot.   
UNICEF supported MoLSA to model child-sensitive social protection and cash transfers targeting 1,000 street working children and their households (reaching over 70,000 members) in four provinces. Effective implementation of ‘cash plus care’ programmes depends on availability of a skilled social service workforce to support the child protection case management system and to identify beneficiaries, assess and validate the vulnerability criteria, and ensure that, in addition to cash grant, children/families receive quality protection services. Linking a model of case management and integrated package of services, such as social protection, WASH, health, education, psychosocial support for positive impact, relies on implementing an integrated systems-wide approach bringing together MoLSA, UNICEF, CSOs and the private sector/financial service providers such as banks.  Based on this successful pilot, UNICEF aims to scale-up in 2021.
In 2021, UNICEF will be working with NSIA to establish and strengthen remote data collection systems, a need highlighted by COVID-19. The MICS plus approach is under consideration to be established under the backbone of the planned (DHS). This will provide the government of Afghanistan with a more agile data collection system for use in the context where field visits are limited, yet still with the capacity to produce robust and representative estimates on fast changing key indicators.
The pandemic has also showed the need for strengthening the humanitarian-nexus approach. ACO WASH programme has continued investing in durable and sustainable solutions by supporting the Government to adopt climate resilient WASH services and by increasingly adopting clean energy, solar powered and gravity fed water supply schemes. These approaches will be scaled up in the coming years to ensure affordable and sustainable water services to both rural and urban communities.
As an innovative initiative, UNICEF supported Afghan Girls’ Robotic team (Afghan Dreamers) in western Herat to develop a Ventilator and Ultra-Violet Radiation (UVR) Machine to support the COVID-19 response.  The Afghan Dreamers comprise of five adolescent girls aged between 14 and 17 years, coordinated by a team leader. After three months, using second-hand car spare parts, an automated bag- valve-mask ventilation unit was developed to address the shortage of ventilator devices.  This is one of the first of its kind developed by adolescent girls and has been endorsed by the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH).
"
SAR,Bangladesh,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The COVID-19 pandemic has once again taught us the importance of disaster preparedness, including to ‘think of the unthinkables’ (e.g., ‘Global Level 3’ emergency and the difficulty of expecting support from outside the country); continuously monitor how the situation develops; and adjust actions accordingly and in a timely manner. To keep operations running smoothly and efficiently under extremely challenging circumstances, the country office adjusted its work processes and internal control mechanisms. The new ways of working, using information technology and networks, has proven to be effective. In terms of programming, the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis accelerated the development, deployment and implementation of several innovative solutions that support service delivery, monitoring and communication with beneficiaries.
Agility and flexibility in how UNICEF operates is critical. Thanks to relative flexibility in resources and geographical presence, UNICEF could respond swiftly to the rapidly changing context of the global pandemic, leveraging opportunities and influencing strategic direction to ensure the protection of children’s rights. UNICEF supported the Government of Bangladesh in establishing/strengthening real-time data systems to enable faster, evidence-based decision-making to respond to COVID-19. Under UNICEF coordination, the RCCE Pillar for the national COVID-19 response conducted over 42 evidence generation activities, including U-Report mobile-based polling, online and observation surveys. Results of the data collection and analysis were shared to inform RCCE strategies, messaging and activities, and to adjust them continuously in the manner of a ‘learning organization’. 
 
During lockdown, 45 million children (under 14 years of age) in Bangladesh were trapped in homes where the use of physical violence is rife (MICS, 2019). This highlighted a clear need to expand and strengthen the social services workforce to ensure that an active child protection case management system is available when children need help. Currently, Bangladesh has less than 20 per cent of the required social service workforce.
 
The initiation of virtual court proceedings for children in conflict with the law served as an innovation for countries across the South Asia region. This approach provided the opportunity to expedite cases and trials involving children and to minimize their exposure to the negative court environment while also reducing logistics and transportation costs. 
 
The devastating impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have reiterated the importance of implementing a systemic and comprehensive approach to social protection for children. Having such an approach in place in Bangladesh prior to COVID-19 would have assisted millions of children in 2020. UNICEF continues its policy advocacy to prioritize an emergency universal child benefit programme for caregivers of children aged 0–5 years. There is also a need to strengthen the existing administrative and delivery structures of the social protection system to better implement crisis response measures.
 
With icddr,b, KTH Royal Institute of Technology and the University of Oxford, UNICEF designed action research entitled ‘Detection of SARS-CoV-2 elements in wastewater and development of wastewater-based epidemiological (WBE) surveillance protocol’. Proof of concept and collaboration with the government Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) have been established to further pursue the possible utility of this approach for early detection of pathogens, including COVID-19, in wastewater, particularly in urban areas.
 
It is critical to further speed up the cycle of (a) obtaining large-scale quantifiable data on the situation of children and women to make informed decisions; (b) developing effective and scalable interventions based on that data/evidence; and (c) continuously monitoring the situation on a real-time basis to see the impact and the possible need for course correction. The system to enable this must be established during non-emergency time and should be useful in both development and humanitarian contexts. U-Report partly filled this role during the pandemic in 2020 and can be further improved upon.  
Innovations 
UNICEF supported the development and introduction of the COVID-19 Dashboard – an online surveillance system that provides the latest data on the situation in Bangladesh. With up-to-date information on the number of tests, confirmed cases and deaths, and other data on the status of COVID-19 in country, the online dashboard is the primary reference point for government officials and partners. UNICEF also provided technical assistance to the IEDCR Coronavirus COVID-19 Dashboard (<http://103.247.238.81/webportal/pages/covid19.php>) which has been widely used as a reference source for monitoring, public information and media reporting.
 
UNICEF supported the design of the remote learning for all children during the school closures caused by COVID-19, using television, radio and mobile phones as platforms for home-based education. The use of RapidPro enhanced the coverage of nutrition services and monitoring via mobile phones. For example, comprehensive competency-based training in nutrition modules were digitalized, and nutrition-focused text messages were sent to adolescents’ mobile phones using RapidPro open-source software. With UNICEF advocacy, virtual court proceedings were introduced to expedite children’s cases and trials, protecting children’s health and rights and improving operational efficiency at the same time. To ensure the continuity of health and nutrition services, UNICEF supported DGHS to initiate telemedicine to provide expert advice and counselling from a distance. 
 
Through the expansion and strengthening of the national child helpline, children and adolescents requiring assistance were able to receive urgent referrals and support. Thousands of emergency rescues occurred during lockdown. 
 
Adolescent and youth engagement was promoted through various technological tools and platforms including virtual adolescent clubs, the national multimedia ECM campaign, UNICEF Generation Parliament Facebook groups and U-Report. 
 
Arsenic screening created a huge demand for safe water within the area of the Strengthen and Scale Up Drinking Water Safety in Bangladesh project. This has prompted the communities in the project area to put pressure on local government representatives to ensure the provision of safe water. A study of safely managed on-site sanitation identified that to reach SDG target 6.2, the WASH sector must focus more on the sanitation service chain rather than chiefly on sanitation coverage.
 
The Shishu Evidence Platform was developed to enhance the high-frequency data collection under the partnership with the World Bank. Additionally, a dashboard was created for undertaking predictive data analysis with a2i to strengthen informed decision-making processes in the fight against COVID-19.

SAR,Bhutan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"GA1: EVERY CHILD SURVIVES AND THRIVES
 
Lessons learned: The COVID-19 pandemic brought to the fore the importance of coordinated preparedness, especially stocking up on essential medicines and supplies including vaccines. Pandemic-induced travel and flight restrictions as well as border closures required intense coordination across government as well as with UNICEF HQ. The need for continued risk communication and community engagement to sustain positive behavioural practices was also a key lesson in responding to the pandemic.  
 
Innovation: UNICEF supported MoH to conduct virtual capacity building of health workers on MNP supplementation and IYCF counselling through Zoom, helping to achieve the target of MNP supplementation scale-up to at least 18 of the targeted 20 districts. 
 
GA2: EVERY CHILD LEARNS
 
Lesson learned: The importance of emergency preparedness planning in the context of education to ensure learning continuity, encompassing the needs of the most vulnerable, especially those with disabilities and hard-to-reach children. A tracer study conducted by the MoE with UNICEF support through the google platform involving more than 13,200 respondents representing students, teachers, and parents/guardians, revealed video lessons mainly targeted the higher classes. Other issues which emerged were the quality of learning, the amount of support received by children from parents and caregivers in terms of time and other necessary resources such as gadgets and space, and in terms of access for children with disabilities. Further, the video lessons had limited emphasis on conceptual understanding vital in enhancing students’ competencies to cope with learning in higher grades when the situation returns to normal. 
 
Innovation: To support the continuity of learning for children who had no access to either online or TV-based lessons during the pandemic, Self-Instructional Materials (SIM) were developed and disseminated.
 
GA3: EVERY CHILD IS PROTECTED FROM VIOLENCE AND EXPLOITATION
 
Innovation: Case management protocols for child protection and GBV were adapted to the COVID-19 situation to ensure that the social service workforce had adequate resources (PPE, updated referral pathways, appropriate devices, etc.) while ensuring the continuous provision of services. Provision of mental health and psychosocial services also had to be adapted through various online platforms such as telephone, zoom, skype, and WhatsApp.
 
GA4: EVERY CHILD LIVES IN A SAFE AND CLEAN ENVIRONMENT
 
Lesson learned: While UNICEF continues to work on WASH in Schools through an increased focus on upstream interventions over the last 2-3 years and the Government has taken over most of the construction and maintenance of water supply schemes and toilets, there has been decreasing financial support over time impacting sustainability. Advocacy efforts at the highest level need to be reinforced through the finalization of a WASH investment case along with continued support for upgradation of unhygienic toilets using innovative as well as environment-friendly and cost-effective interventions (for example, SATO pan). 
 
Innovation: Innovation in the context of COVID-19 has been to accelerate WASH activities such as installation of handwashing stations in public places as well as in schools, monastic institutions and health care facilities as a means towards infection control. To adapt with impacts of climate change, for the first-time a heat pump hot water system which enables a 70 percent energy has been piloted at one monastic school to provide to warm water for personal hygiene. 
 
GA5: EVERY CHILD HAS AN EQUITABLE CHANCE IN LIFE
 
Lesson learned: Social policy is relatively a new area in Bhutan and can only work with a complete ‘buy-in’ from the Government. In the face of an increasingly limited fiscal space for social sectors, UNICEF needs to further invest in improving the understanding of key government agencies, especially Ministry of Finance, GNHC, Parliament and local government authorities, to invest in child outcomes. Different entry points for influencing upstream policy making and programming are being developed by UNICEF Bhutan in the form of partnerships on child-friendly local governance, social sector investment cases, vulnerability analysis, social protection policy briefs, integrated cross-sectoral programming using civic participation of young people, and capacity building of the local leaders on community consultation and engagement for developing local government plans.
 
Lesson learned: During the review of the Youth Policy, UNICEF through its partners, provided a platform to over 1,200 youth (116 F) from different backgrounds to raise their voice in reforming the Policy and to have their inputs included. This was in response to a lesson learned during development of the 2011 National Youth Policy in Bhutan which fell short in consulting young people. 
 
Innovation: UNICEF’s expertise working with youth volunteers, diverse national partners and NGOs resulted in the engagement of 3,811 scout volunteers (2,213 F) to lead advocacy campaigns on the promotion of COVID-19 preventive behaviors and health safety protocols. Additionally, 117 adolescents (57 F) across 11 districts were trained as an enquirer to strengthen support mechanisms for their peers in the communities. 
 
Innovation: To overcome the constraints imposed by COVID-19, UNICEF and the Evaluation Association of Bhutan turned the scheduled face-to-face evaluation training into an online format. 
 
CROSS CUTTING
Lesson learned: The COVID-19 pandemic brought to the fore the importance of consolidating actions which support results for children through strengthened coordination, accountability and a strong focus on the humanitarian-development nexus. Pre-planned activities were reprogrammed in coordination with Government and partners to fit with the needs as well as the limitations imposed by COVID-19 without compromising UNICEF’s mandate. 
 
All the lessons learned and innovations described above will be used to improve interventions in 2021 as well as to inform the Mid-Term Review of the current Country Programme in various areas including: continued maternal/child health and nutrition system strengthening; COVID-19 vaccination and RCCE; safe return to ECCD and schools with quality interventions on many education fronts including the potential for nationwide digitalization; evaluation of UNICEF’s support for inclusive education; further child protection workforce and system strengthening; expanded adolescent skill-building and civic engagement; new private sector engagements; initiation of child-friendly local governance and innovative public financing for children; an intensified focus on shock-responsive social safety nets; and continued advancement of our internal business processes.

SAR,India,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Key innovations
 
UNICEF was able to move to remote functioning. The experience of lockdown and related homeworking has demonstrated the potential for further efficiencies, such as increasing the provision of offsite support to staff and decreasing transactions in travel, event management and logistics. The Country Office already has in-house capacity in areas such as result-based budgeting and measuring results with value-for-money – this can be boosted at little cost and without bringing in external consultants. UNICEF now has the ability and buy-in to undertake a greater degree of virtual capacity building, reaching a greater audience while reducing costs and the environmental impact of travel. There is wide support for flexible work arrangements, including working-from-home, which has increased accountability, trust, focus on the work rather than time-in-chair and work/life balance. 
 
Utilizing an automated platform to facilitate data storage and aggregation. UNICEF has successfully designed and institutionalized a results assessment module – RAM-India – for monitoring and reporting. This system has systematically and effectively facilitated the reporting of disaggregated data. It also allows trend analysis of reporting on COVID-19. 
 
Leveraging innovative data gathering. Over 30 studies were initiated across almost all states to understand and gather evidence on the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on children and their households, covering continuation of services, receipt of social protection, and economic and psychosocial impact. New approaches to data collection included virtual surveys and the use of mobile phones. The rapid assessment using Rapid pro in Maharashtra provided concurrent monitoring of the status of WASH services and the engagement of over 55,000 sanitation workers in the state. Also, as a part of the UN’s joint response to COVID-19 in India, a joint community-based monitoring exercise was undertaken using a mobile application for data gathering to assess the direct impact of the pandemic on the general population. 
 
Streamlining operations to facilitate programme implementation. This has involved reducing the demand from Programmes for routine services by improving the efficiency of processes, deploying e-tools and shifting relevant processes to the Global Shared Service Centre. Capacity has been freed up for Operations to provide more strategic support on partnerships management, financial assurance and compliance with the Harmonized Approach to Cash Transfers standards.  
Key lessons learned and way forward
The midterm strategic reflection examined programmes in the light of the external environment and the pandemic. Given the significant and rapidly evolving changes in the operating environment, including those due to COVID-19, and the increasing pressures on limited resources in 2020, UNICEF has reviewed children’s vulnerabilities and critical barriers to optimise the focus and effectiveness of its programmes. Each UNICEF programme outcome area has identified key shifts and adjustments in its strategies and approaches to achieving results for children in the remaining years of the country programme, considering the COVID-19 pandemic and government priorities. Key building blocks for the next country programme cycle have also been mapped out.
Creating a results-driven culture within UNICEF, based on a strong evidence agenda, is a priority. Strengthening the culture of results-based management is an ongoing process of building clear guidelines for the differentiated approach of programming in India. It is supported by continuous capacity building such as orientation, quality assurance, backstop support and feedback loops. Leadership and buy-in from top management are important contributing factors driving the change-management process. One example of evidence is the first-of-its-kind COVID-19 response digest, which published 134 case studies highlighting the range of interventions and initiatives supported in 2020.[1] Moving forward, a community of practice will be established, identifying results-based management champions to facilitate organizational learning and support for staff across the national and field offices. There will also be more focused knowledge management, leveraging existing evidence and synthesizing it into advocacy briefs.
UNICEF’s convergent approach to multi-sectoral programming, both within UNICEF and in its work with government and other partners, is a key strength. This approach enables programmes and sectors to work together systematically across the whole of childhood to address overlapping deprivations. Using shared platforms and partnerships leads to a complementary continuum of services that are integrated at the point of delivery. In parallel, it enables a holistic, comprehensive approach to social and behaviour change. In future, these convergence initiatives will support programmes to take a holistic approach to consider the impacts of COVID-19, including in relation to responsive parenting, distance learning and adolescent mental health. ¿ 
UNICEF India’s differentiated programming approach reiterated the value of paying attention to the context and providing flexibility and visibility to flagship programmes and some individual interventions. Differentiated programming enabled nuanced policy engagement and national discourse to promote coherent policy at state level. It facilitated learning about different approaches to programming, such as working in areas of civil strife and hard-to-reach areas and communities, and in determining the balance of upstream and downstream engagement with different states. Differentiated programming will receive higher priority in future, and will include a stronger equity-lens and increased learning within and across states.  
To achieve shifts in gender dynamics, UNICEF’s programmes need localized approaches to systematically tackle both immediate and underlying causes of gender inequities. The complex links between gender and other forms of inequity require strong convergence across sectors in programme design, implementation and monitoring. More gender-sensitive indicators and clearer staff accountability for gender results can help maintain focus on the issue, and more time will be needed for multi-sectoral collaboration and the development of localized interventions. Over the coming two years a stronger evidence base and understanding of gender dynamics will be needed, particularly in emerging areas of work such as urban programming, children on the move and digitization of services and education. Gender vulnerabilities will also need to be re-examined through the lens of COVID-19.

"
SAR,Maldives,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"While 2020 provided many challenges, the COVID-19 pandemic also led to unprecedented opportunities for learning and innovation. UNICEF MCO was able to rapidly switch focus from ongoing policy and development work to an urgent humanitarian response, including managing increased emergency funding and scaled-up operations. Lessons were learnt and insights achieved across all areas of work, allowing UNICEF MCO to better reach and support the most vulnerable children and families, immediately and in the future. Some of the key lessons are described below.
 
Policy
 
UNICEF MCO needs to strengthen capacity of the education sector to prepare for and respond to emergencies. During the COVID-19 response, UNICEF MCO recognized the need for policymakers to better understand the inequities that exist between schools in different locations, and the importance of continuity of learning during emergencies. This also includes a better understanding of an inclusive approach to identifying and addressing learning loss.
 
The COVID-19 pandemic revealed the risks associated with the Maldives’ dependency on food imports and consequent negative impacts on food security. While the tourism and construction sectors are thriving, UNICEF MCO needs to explore other sectors, such as agriculture and fisheries, for skills development and employment of young people.
 
Through high-level and timely engagement with key policymakers, UNICEF MCO enabled positive changes to the child protection system – this is particularly significant in the context of COVID-19, which exposed significant institutional gaps. UNICEF MCO learned that involving high level leadership is a faster and more effective way to achieve results from advocacy efforts. 
 
Technology and online outreach
 
In education, UNICEF MCO expanded the use of innovative technology during the pandemic, and capacitated 54 percent of teachers in Government schools with online teaching skills. Online learning also helped children and parents to develop digital literacy skills, strengthening the system’s resilience and preparedness for future emergencies. 
 
From community-based online sessions on children’s mental health and emotional resilience, UNICEF MCO learned that a fully functional online support system is necessary to reach the most vulnerable groups and provide them with relevant services, especially during a public health emergency. UNICEF MCO continued its engagement with the First Lady, who is also the Child Rights Champion, bringing increased attention to violence against children across the country. 
 
In external relations, UNICEF MCO’s online engagement channels proved to be highly effective in reaching many with limited effort, especially in a geographically scattered country like the Maldives. Social and electronic media were used to convey lifesaving messages and engage with key stakeholders including children, to create awareness on child rights and challenges faced due to COVID-19, and to invite views on improving the pandemic response of UNICEF Maldives. 
 
Data
 
The need for high frequency monitoring and reporting of results during the COVID-19 emergency revealed limitations of government systems for data collection and use in an emergency. This prompted the realization that the MCO and its government counterparts were unprepared for planning, monitoring and reporting in situations where the programme focus must switch from longer-term policy work to short-term life-saving interventions. The country office has begun a gap analysis of the existing government system and is supporting the related departments with training for staff and development of data collection tools.
 
In addition, the lack of a functional health information management system affected the ability of the Government and other partners to obtain real-time data on service access, coverage and monitoring of essential health indicators. The delays in developing the DHIS-II system created severe challenges in monitoring health services and responding efficiently and effectively to the emerging COVID-19 situation.
 
Logistics
 
With the decision by the government and UNICEF to provide food baskets to vulnerable families during lockdown, it became evident that the necessary items were not readily available from a single supplier. This took time to address. The lesson learned was that appropriate logistical arrangements for any emergency operation are crucial and should be implemented as the top priority. Prior identification of service providers and potential suppliers could make a huge impact.
 
For smaller country offices, without prior service delivery experience, shifting gears to immediately transition from upstream policy support to a humanitarian response is extremely challenging, unless there is timely technical and financial support from the Regional Office and HQ. In such a situation, country offices should proactively reach out to seek advice and the Regional Office should also immediately contact the country offices without waiting for them to ask for help.
 
Human resources and funding
 
UNICEF’s swift change to emergency programming was crucial in meeting the Government’s needs in a continuously changing situation. UNICEF addressed unmet HR needs when the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted HR gaps in the health system in the Maldives, particularly at the central level. For example, the country office placed a dedicated technical consultant within the HPA nutrition programme, which proved to be instrumental in continuing critical work supported by UNICEF, including programme monitoring during the COVID-19 response.
 
UNICEF mobilized funds to address emerging demands, such as the requirement for cold chain equipment. The pandemic underscored the need for an adequately funded and resourced health programme in the Maldives, and the need to scale-up support as necessary.
 
MCO’s ability to promptly change from developmental work to emergency programming allowed UNICEF to support critical Government responses. Increased funding was instrumental to support critical areas during the pandemic response in health, education, social protection and child protection sectors. The increased scale-up in provision of supplies has significantly helped to strengthen systems in the long-term. For example, the procurement of medical supplies and vaccine cold chain equipment will continue to benefit beyond the COVID-19 response. 

COVID-19 also highlighted critical gaps in areas such as Mental Health and Psychosocial Support Services, and the need for comprehensive programming. The timely support provided by UNICEF to key partners has led to expansion of services, and underscored the need for dedicated programming in the future. Further, it also highlighted the importance of factoring these new areas of work in the continued COVID responses in 2021, in order to build sustainable systems for continued services.
"
SAR,Nepal,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"One of the major lessons learned during the COVID-19 response was the need  for greater funding flexibility to facilitate the “repurposing” of programmes and related funding to adapt to pandemic needs and  deliver timely results on the ground. Funding inflexibility in adjusting geographic locations, specific targets, and settings as per initial planning/funding proposals to the changed realities,  in many instances limited the capacity to effectively respond to the situation. Good practice examples of funding flexibility in  UNICEF’s partnerships with UK Aid Direct and the governments of Finland and Japan, proved a major catalyst to facilitate reprogramming leading to impressive results on the ground achieved. 

The engagement and orientation of local leaders on the Immunization Act led to proactive social mobilization at the sub-national level. The commitment and continuous support of local leaders,  for programme implementation monitoring was critical to inform them of the programmatic achievements and gaps, and secured their commitment for resource allocation in their annual plans. The achievement of the nation-wide measles-rubella and vitamin A campaigns could not have been achieved without the strong engagement of local leaders throughout the process.
The COVID-19 pandemic has been a massive challenge and disruption to the education sector. However, it also functioned as a catalyst in terms of  “thinking outside the box” and in coordination and collaboration across different tiers of government and inter sectors (WASH, Protection, Health), in reaching the unreached for continuation of learning beyond classroom environment and during emergencies, supporting humanitarian and development nexus.
Investment in preparedness through regular programmes paid back a healthy return during the COVID-19 response. Through the Child-Centred Disaster Risk Reduction (CCDRR) programme, UNICEF imparted its knowledge and skills on disaster risk mitigation planning to local governments, child-club networks and communities. Children and adolescents who were part of the capacity-building initiatives of the regular programme played a crucial role in disseminating messages on COVID-19 prevention, and highlighted the importance of linking development and humanitarian programming.
UNICEF developed and implemented a joint programme that brought WASH, C4D, CCDRR  and Emergency programme elements  together for COVID-19 preparedness and response in 53 municipalities, through the Red Cross partnership. The integrated  programming helped avoid silos and duplications, reduced costs and brought better ideas and results for children. Building on this success and the lessons learned, health components will also be added to subsequent programme formulation. 
Child Protection issues require attention and programming from various actors and sectors. The experience of the protection cluster, inter-agency working groups on child protection, ending child marriage and child labour, clearly showed that it is important to strengthen alliances at all levels for the prevention and response to child protection concerns. However, the current context also presents an opportunity to reinforce the humanitarian-development nexus around child protection, through strengthened child protection systems and effective engagement of duty bearers and community actors within the response.
The Child and Family Tracker, designed to follow the situation of children and families, remains one of the most innovative ventures of UNICEF Nepal in 2020. This instrument allowed UNICEF to place children strongly within the national COVID-19 discourse. A longitudinal survey delivered via phone was innovative in both the survey design, as well as the conception of the delivery through telephone. Using a geo-spatial analysis model, the sample size covered 80 per cent of the nation’s municipalities, with a balanced representation of socio-economic-geographic groups. The next innovation was the design of the operational research of cash transfer, which combined the available architecture/collaboration of the survey with a new channel for delivery of cash through eSEWA.  
The Business for Results approach elicited valuable support from the private sector, but needed to be embedded within programmatic priorities so as to avoid ad hoc requests that diminish the overall strategic engagement. In addition, a number of sporadic and siloed approaches to engage the private sector have reinforced the necessity for a planned B4R workshop, which would ensure optimal negotiation terms and avoid reputational risks.
Cross-sectoral collaboration across several sections led to excellent opportunities to drive a more dedicated advocacy strategy. The conjoined efforts in addressing urgent priorities such as mental health have resulted in the foundation of a robust advocacy and public campaign on the issue, which targeted young people. The opportunity to strategically and regularly join forces to ensure community engagement outreach and behavioural change is inextricably linked with the activities of external relations, and is an area that needs to be prioritized and strengthened. The risks of not bringing these two pillars of communication together are significant, not only in terms of strengthening accountability to communities, but also in terms of efficiently optimizing resources. 
"
SAR,Pakistan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"COVID-19 confirmed the nexus between humanitarian, early recovery and development.
With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, development funding was rapidly reprogrammed for humanitarian assistance, while humanitarian work laid the foundation for longer-term development. Need for IPC led to political momentum in support of handwashing, and fast-tracked WASH services in schools and healthcare facilities. UNICEF leveraged this interest through support for a Hand Hygiene for All Roadmap in 2021. Existing WASH procurement arrangements were leveraged for rapid service delivery in an unstable market. 
The UNICEF-supported integration of MHPSS into KP health services in 2019 was originally motivated by the impacts of years of insecurity on children and women. In 2020, this model provided a foundation for COVID-19 response and its replication in other provinces, with existing training materials rapidly adapted and rolled out. In Punjab, health professionals and social welfare officers facilitated self-care for frontline workers and provided non-specialized care to affected populations. 
The pandemic demonstrated the linkages between C4D interventions in humanitarian and development situations. The COVID-19 RCCE strategy built substantively on polio infrastructure and scaled up community engagement and new partnerships, application of technology and innovative approach to social and behavioural analytics. This experience is now guiding a review of communication and community engagement strategies to leverage COVID-19 C4D investments for other priorities, including polio eradication. 
An office framework to link humanitarian and development programmes has been prioritized for 2021.
Integrating and consolidating interventions can help ensure effective, sustainable services. 
Mainstreaming nutrition into the Universal Health Care benefit package emerged as a fast and sustainable way to increase coverage and ensure service availability at primary and community levels of care. Applying a similar approach to the nutrition information system, linking it with DHIS2, will advance the institutionalization of nutrition in Pakistan. 
An integrated health, nutrition, WASH and birth registration service delivery package was developed to address multiple deprivations and contribute to polio eradication in the 40 SHRUCs. The packages included an integrated referral system to identify and link zero-dose children with immunization and other healthcare services. In seven union councils, where the distribution of 13,000 referral slips was piloted during polio campaigns, about 35 per cent of those referred had used facility-based services, and half of the identified zero-dose children were vaccinated. These early results show promise as a means of achieving wide-ranging results in the most marginalized communities. 
Continuity of learning created opportunities for innovation in a traditional sector. 
School closures due to COVID-19 risked increasing Pakistan's high proportion of out-of-school children. This led to rapid adaptation and innovation by governments and sector partners to ensure continuity of learning even in contexts where digital solutions were not practical. As a result, innovative learning modes evolved that included blended remote learning through high-tech (apps, online platforms), low-tech (television, SMS) and no-tech (worksheets, homework) modalities to sustain learning for over 8 million students. Although reach was relatively small, based on the success of these initiatives, UNICEF and JICA are supporting the Government to develop a Continuity of Learning framework adapted to the local context.
New communication partnerships and approaches amplified messaging. 
The production of professional, multilingual video content including messages recorded with adolescents and celebrities greatly increased UNICEF's social media audience, especially among youth. Targeted outreach was expanded with virtual events attended by government officials, celebrities, religious leaders and young people which were broadcast on social media and sometimes on national television, with excerpts disseminated via social media and WhatsApp. This successfully encouraged the engagement of adolescents and young people. To address the digital divide, which favours boys and men, online messaging was complemented with traditional modes of information dissemination (such as television and radio) and women-focused platforms (such as the Ehsaas platform) also reached marginalized women and girls. 
RCCE demonstrated the value of systematic investment in the use of interactive voice recording (IVR) technology and internet-based survey for social listening and behavioural analytics that informed targeted messaging.
Non-traditional partners for communication enlisted for the COVID-19 response have laid the foundations for future collaboration. These included professional organizations such as the Pakistan Paediatrics Association, which collaborated with UNICEF on producing and disseminating materials on COVID-19 and children, and with utility companies whose personnel installed safe handwashing stations that also displayed key messages on COVID-19.
School Management Committee (SMC) structures were widely mobilized to reach parents and community members to support continuity of learning, safe school returns and COVID-19 prevention behaviours. Community WASH structures, such as Village WASH Committees and social mobilizers, ensured continuity of services and hygiene promotion, including IPC, when CSO and government staff were subject to travel restrictions. 
Looking ahead 
UNICEF conducted an elective mid-term review of its country programme in 2020. While theories of change remain broadly valid, it revealed some necessary adjustments to respond to Pakistan's changing context, streamline priorities, and integrate lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic. These include enhancing life-cycle approaches, mainstreaming gender and DRM across programmes, and a greater emphasis on integrated approaches. 
Going forward, UNICEF will focus on change strategies including business for results; gender equality programming with explicit programmatic targets; social policy; C4D for change in social norms and behaviours; advocacy and communication; partnerships with UN, public and private sectors, civil society, foundations and academia; research and evaluation; and supply, procurement and logistics. The life cycle approach will be enhanced through support for ECD and adolescent wellbeing, particularly for girls. Staff gender parity will be improved by implementing the recommendations of a DHR gender analysis study and proactive outreach to qualified women candidates.
UNICEF will continue to produce gender-equitable results and work towards legislative changes to strengthen gender-responsive systems. Integrated programming efforts will support wellbeing and empowerment of adolescent girls, including prevention of GBV, child marriage and early pregnancy, safe education and vocational training, adolescent nutrition and adapted WASH services. Gender mainstreaming will focus on transformative actions and will be systematized to capture gender results."
SAR,"ROSA, Nepal",Lessons Learned and Innovations,"2020 will be remembered for the extraordinary challenges and unpredictable disruptions it presented to UNICEF ROSA and the region. The RO repurposed and adjusted its priorities and workplans to respond to the pandemic’s challenges. It effectively reorganized itself to support SAR countries in response to the pandemic, the RO team helped guide the responses, tailored to the context of each country. In line with the four global acceleration areas, six working groups[1] were established to liaise and support countries with their response. 
The major lessons were provided by the pandemic and responses to it; the learning had to be quick, innovative and translated into appropriate, effective reactions. Learning went hand-in-hand with innovation. It was of necessity characterized by rapid reaction to massive and sudden changes in the operating environment. Extended hindsight will allow for more mature reflection of what worked well and what experience will show might have been done better. 
ROSA responded to the lockdown by a stay-and-deliver approach to ensure continued delivery of services. Staff worked from home. Assistance to COs was delivered virtually, as were interactions with partners. 
Rapid real-time evidence analysis and packaging, and using that to respond effectively to an ever-changing context, was an important lesson learned. For instance, the analysis of the pandemic’s spread patterns showed that the virus infection was prevalent in high density, low capacity areas. Based on that evidence, ROSA quickly developed a guide to assist the COs to programme in the most affected areas.
Digital solutions were used to support programming. The regional U-Report South Asia platform was set up and attracted more than 113,000 young people to learn about adolescent health, climate change, and COVID-19 in their local languages. The climate change poll became the centrepiece for the ‘Rising to the Challenge’ report, to be used for advocacy in education and climate change fora. Online surveys were much used by COs during the lockdown periods, with expert support for survey design and data analysis provided by a new Real-Time Monitoring contractor. This included support to the ROSA RCCE Working Group to implement standard questionnaire modules in RapidPro measuring vaccine hesitancy and an online dashboard to monitor the COVAX rollout across South Asia. The Regional Innovation Governance Committee focused their bi-annual discussions on ways to foster an innovation-related culture within UNICEF, the immediate need for governments to offer remote education, and on innovative portfolio management with Young UNICEF involvement. ROSA supported development of the EasyWash handwashing monitoring device for schools, a winner in the 2018 Regional WASH Innovation Challenge. The Government of Bangladesh officially approved a field trial of EasyWash devices in 48 schools.
 
In nutrition, ROSA helped COs to ensure continuity in essential services for children with wasting through simplified approaches in screening and care for severely wasted children. For example, the family mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) approaches introduced in Nepal proved to be an empowering tool for caregivers, allowing them to fully participate in the screening and monitoring of the nutrition status of children in their homes despite the Covid-19 restrictions. Pakistan included a number of these approaches in the national management of COVID-19 guidelines, such as a reduced number of visits and reduced dosage of RUTF. The family MUAC approach allowed mothers and fathers to monitor the nutritional status of their children on behalf of health workers. Preparation of documentation and analysis of these actions is ongoing.
ROSA had to immediately change its focus and priorities from those envisioned at the start of 2020. That was an office-wide challenge. By mid-year, most teams had readjusted with much work and collaboration taking place virtually. Along these lines, most teams effectively adopted remote coordination mechanisms, including online meeting tools, working with in-country vendors and others to ensure the continuity of UNICEF regional activities. The Regional Management Team meetings and other network meetings happened virtually with equal success. With regards to communication on COVID-19, across SAR, ROSA noted fatigue with respect to existing RCCE messaging on COVID-19, with approaches appearing saturated and needing refreshment, requiring more innovative programme approaches to get the message across.
On innovations, some interesting achievements are noted within Operations. In collaboration with the Global Shared Service Centre, Division of Financial and Administrative Management Treasury, Supply Division, ROSA introduced important innovations in business and transaction simplification: (i) procurement cards piloted in all COs and in the Regional Office; and (ii) mAsset, an asset management application, which consolidates the asset records below $2,500, in VISION was successfully piloted (including the PSB tool). To improve internal office processes, the contract alert system was automated, and the visa/driving licence expiry alert system was launched in coordination with the ICT team.
Moving into 2021, the office will continue these efforts alongside existing work in achieving the regional headline results and complementary results. Several focus areas were identified as needing office-wide attention: vaccination from COVID-19, narrowing the digital divide, increasing employable skills, strengthening leadership in evidence, increasing connectedness within the office to heighten sense of belonging, pride and relevance. These new focus areas will influence the design of the upcoming ROMP 2022-2025.

SAR,Sri Lanka,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF can deliver results differently when the enabling environment is conducive. The COVID-19 pandemic pushed the Sri Lanka Country Office (SLCO) to rethink approaches and innovate in ways that previously were almost inconceivable. The extended, strict lockdown imposed in Sri Lanka transformed our operational context and demanded UNICEF and our implementing partners to rethink how to deliver timely results. UNICEF staff were required to work from home for 3-6 months, many of whom were also required to simultaneously balance family responsibilities. Although working in a ‘virtual’ environment can be challenging, through supportive leadership, the flexibility and commitment of staff and engagement by Staff Association, morale remained high and staff navigated obstacles. With government, the extent to which our partners were able to move their work online varied, with some embracing digital options and others persisting in requiring face-to-face meetings. Regardless, 2020 provided opportunities to advance work that UNICEF has advocated for years. For example, launching U-Report to engage Sri Lankan young people, reaching over 6,800 young people, including on issues such as COVID-19 awareness and preparedness to return to school. In addition, through new partnerships, UNICEF was able to advance programming in urban areas for some of the least visible communities in the country and leveraged private sector partnerships to support the government response. These opportunities were partly as a result of resources being available, but also the willingness and ability of UNICEF and government to take it forward.
 
UNICEF often has a unique convening role and we should use it. The impact of COVID-19 was felt across South Asia by early March 2020. In Sri Lanka, as the economy slowed and schools closed, the lives and livelihoods of communities across the island were affected, especially women and children. With the rising caseload of COVID-19 globally, there was a related rise in demand for Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) to keep frontline workers safe and healthy; however in March/April the demand for PPEs, much of which was being managed by Supply Division (+/- 65% of global PPE procurement), far outwighed existing global supply chains.
   
Recognizing these challenges, in April 2020, UNICEF South Asia Region held regional discussions to identify the industries and countries most effected and sought to propose solutions to the exponential growth in demand for PPEs. UNICEF Sri Lanka was quick to follow up and identify opportunities to connect garment industry partners with Supply Division. The garment industry in South Asia generally, and Sri Lanka specifically, is one of the leading industries in the region with some of the largest global players, many of which had been devastated by the termination of orders from European and other markets. Majority of these garment manufacturers employ mainly female workers. In April/ May 2020, following confirmed interest by many garment companies, UNICEF Sri Lanka, its Regional Office and Supply Division and the UN Resident Coordinator met with the Presidential Task Force for Economic Revival and Poverty Eradication and other key stakeholders, including the Export Development Board and relevant private sector entities, to take forward the concept of meeting the global demand for PPE through local producers and resources. Mr Basil Rajapaksa, Chairman of the Task Force, chaired the discussion, through which the entire value chain had been agreed upon, from supply requirements; concerns regarding raw materials; switching production from various other types of garments to COVID-19 PPE; identification and establishment of local and global standards for PPE; and reopening of factories during the pandemic whilst adhering to health and safety standards. The government was appreciative of the UN’s practical, constructive approach to addressing the economic challenges facing Sri Lanka.
 
With all elements effectively in place, several leading garment manufacturers, including MAS Kreeda, took up the challenge to reopen their factories, to diversify their production and switch to manufacturing PPEs. Since the initial discussions and the creation of the environment and opportunity for the local manufacturers, several garment manufacturers have smoothly transitioned from production of general clothing to critical COVID-19 PPE in-line with WHO-approved local standards and ISO certified global standards for Supply Division. Several contracts were agreed with UNICEF’s Supply Division, including MAS Kreeda, to supply for UNICEF/UN global tender, while other contracts were agreed locally for the supply of PPE for Ministry of Health and World Bank procurements.
  
This timely, innovative strategy by UNICEF made a huge impact on the local garment industry, in terms of new opportunities, remaining functional and retaining staff, and global reach, as locally manufactured PPE reached even the most underserved parts of the world through the UN Supply Division. This also shows how even during a pandemic, with the right support, manufacturers can innovate to capture new markets and UNICEF can harness new partners to deliver results.
 
Humanitarian-development nexus is a reality that UNICEF should have at the forefront of its agenda. UNICEF’s approach to the humanitarian-development nexus places an emphasis on key initiatives, including strengthening systems, risk-informed programmes, community participation, planning and preparing for emergencies, and fostering partnerships and mobilising resources. In a middle-income country like Sri Lanka, which has emerged from conflict but also witnessed terrible natural disasters, UNICEF’s programming has operated where humanitarian work and development approaches converge but perhaps the extent to which this happens was revealed by COVID-19. Over the past years, UNICEF Sri Lanka has increasingly moved away from service delivery towards upstream system strengthening, all the while continuing to promote risk-informed programming given the regular threat of monsoons and droughts. COVID-19 also allowed UNICEF to advance other humanitarian/development priorities such as extensive advocacy efforts with the government to strengthen its social protection floor, including provision of a child grant, and building long-term capacity on Child Protection Business Continuity in response to any form of crisis.

WCAR,Benin,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Au cours de la deuxième année de mise en œuvre de son nouveau Programme de Coopération, UNICEF a appris plusieurs leçons, dont les majeures sont reprises ci-dessous : 
La pandémie COVID-19 a permis d’analyser les gaps, de montrer les faiblesses et a révélé une faible capacité de résilience du système sanitaire. La pandémie a beaucoup influencé les acquis antérieurs en matière de couverture sanitaire et de fréquentation des centres de santé, les populations ayant dû renoncer à se rendre au centre de santé et à utiliser les services.
L’engagement de haut niveau du gouvernement avec une vision claire de la riposte à l’urgence sanitaire COVID-19 assorti d’un alignement de l’ensemble des PTFs au plan de réponse national avec comme stratégie « Dépister, Isoler, Traiter, Résilience » a permis au Benin de limiter le nombre de cas et de décès comparativement aux pays voisins.
L’adoption de nouvelles méthodes de travail a permis de contourner la pandémie de la COVID-19 au moyen des Technologies de l’Information et de Communication (le télétravail, réunions virtuelles…) pour assurer le fonctionnement du dispositif de coordination et de planification aussi bien au niveau de l’UNICEF qu’au niveau du Ministère de la santé 
UNICEF Benin a continué de soutenir les innovations initiées en 2019 portant sur la mise en réseau des acteurs en charge de la vaccination par WhatsApp (EQUIVAC) pour un suivi hebdomadaire des couvertures vaccinales en Penta 3, le ‘'VAXYRAPPEL’’ qui permet grâce à la digitalisation des informations relatives aux naissances d’envoyer directement aux mères d’enfants de moins de 5 ans des messages vocaux pour le rappel de rendez de vaccination et pour la réalisation du PCR chez les enfants nés de mères séropositives. 
L’intégration des interventions Nutrition dans les localités FDAL peut largement contribuer à une meilleure compréhension du lien nutrition, hygiène, une amélioration plus rapide du statut nutritionnel de l’enfant au niveau communautaire contribuant ainsi à la réduction de la mortalité des enfants qui aurait été aggravée du fait d’une faible connaissance de ces liens
La COVID-19 a été un déclencheur pour initier des actions de résilience du système éducatif vis-à-vis du choc extérieur à travers la recherche des solutions de diversification des approches d’organisation des activités éducatives notamment l’enseignement à distance via la radio, l’internet etc. ; une solution qui pourrait favoriser l’accès à l’éducation des enfants des zones reculées sans école. 
En outre, les communautés prennent de plus en plus conscience de leur contribution à l’amélioration de la qualité de l’éducation à travers le suivi de la scolarité des enfants et le soutien des enfants en difficulté d’apprentissage à travers les actions mises en place au niveau des communautés.
 
Le dialogue permanent avec les autorités de l’éducation à travers les déjeuners trimestriels instaurés par l’UNICEF en sa qualité de chef de file, est une opportunité pour échanger sur des problèmes précis du secteur de l’éducation et proposer des solutions idoines. 
 
La mobilisation sociale, le renforcement de la collaboration entre partenaires dans l’action et la réduction des coûts d’éducation supportés par les familles produisent des effets positifs sur l’accès et le maintien à l’école.
 
Depuis 2020, trois salles de classes en briques plastiques sont opérationnelles et servent de prototypes de démonstration aux autorités et aux partenaires de développement. L’adhésion du Gouvernement à cette approche constitue une opportunité pour la mise en place d’une usine de recyclage des déchets en plastiques en vue d’offrir aux communautés rurales des infrastructures scolaires respectant l’environnement et à moindre coût.
 
En 2020, plus de 1 000 jeunes, acteurs clés pour la sensibilisation et la mobilisation du public, ont été appuyés par l’UNICEF pour proposer des solutions contre la COVID-19 à travers des défis d’innovation (hackathon), des actions communautaires et sociales et l’engagement avec les médias. Il est néanmoins à noter que la participation des filles reste généralement plus basse. Il sera donc nécessaire de développer des stratégies d’engagement spécifiques aux filles afin d’améliorer leur participation dans les actions des jeunes soutenues par l’UNICEF.
 
En matière de protection de l’enfant, le renforcement des capacités des acteurs du secteur sur le SIDoFFE-NG axé sur leurs besoins réels a permis d’optimiser les performances de la base de données. Néanmoins, les efforts doivent s’intensifier afin que le système parvienne à fournir de manière systématique et complète, des statistiques de routine, désagrégées selon les standards, sur les services fournis y compris ceux des acteurs non-gouvernementaux en vue d’assurer l’exhaustivité des informations collectées à cet effet. En outre, La nouvelle réforme de gestion des systèmes d’identité, en s’adossant à l’état civil pour l’enregistrement des personnes et la création d’un numéro d’identité unique du citoyen est une opportunité majeure pour l’accélération de l’enregistrement universel des naissances. Il sera nécessaire de s’assurer que des procédures opérationnelles appropriées soient mises en œuvre pour garantir une passerelle adéquate avec l’enregistrement des naissances et le retrait des certificats afin que les insuffisances du système actuel concernant les naissances soient adressées. Par ailleurs, l’extension et l’opérationnalisation des mécanismes d’alerte à travers les comités de veille villageois et la LAE favorisent la dénonciation des cas et la prise en charge d’un plus grand nombre d’enfants victimes de violence. Ces efforts se poursuivront et s’intensifieront.
 
La mise en place d’experts dédiées à l’élaboration et la production des documents budgétaires a permis d’améliorer les performances du Bénin en matière de transparence budgétaire et de participation citoyenne. 
La collaboration intersectorielle au sein du bureau a permis de concevoir le programme Cash plus Care pour contribuer à mettre fin au mariage des enfants et des adolescentes à travers l’élimination de la pauvreté tout en adressant les normes sociales qui perpétuent ce fléau. Cette collaboration intersectorielle permettra d’accélérer l’atteinte des KRC 5, 6.
La dissémination du mécanisme de participation des Organisations de la Société Civile locales au processus budgétaire et de redevabilité à travers un document synthèse, un atelier de sensibilisation et des émissions radiodiffusés a permis la sensibilisation des élus locaux sur la budgétisation sensible aux enfants, les avantages de la transparence budgétaire et du budget participatif.

WCAR,Burkina Faso,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons learned
 
Continuity of services in the context of COVID-19 and beyond (as part of Stay and Deliver[1]):  the occurrence of COVID-19 pandemic since March 2020 demonstrated that other ways of working can be adopted, such as E-meetings, teleworking, implementation of activities with small groups, etc. to achieve planned results for children while integrating prevention measures (social distancing ect..). Similarly, remote work modality constitutes a solution to the increasingly difficult access to the most hard-to-reach areas of the country.
 
The community approach is a means of mitigating risks associated with multiple crises for service delivery: the institutionalized community platform with 17,800 Community-Based Health Workers was an opportunity to ensure continuity of nutrition services despite COVID-19 limitations, by delegation of tasks in areas where health centres are closed. The strategy of working with local surveyors during the nutrition survey had allowed to collect nutrition data in insecure areas and reduced movement of people from one place to another during COVID-19 context. The experience started between the NGO “Alima” and UNICEF in Barsalogho health district demonstrated that implementation of simplified approaches for prevention and treatment of acute malnutrition in health districts where health centres are closed is promising to improve the coverage of the CMAM programme.
 
The adoption of differentiated approach to the implementation and monitoring of activities can generate efficiency gains in targeted regions: Based on the profiles of each region, COVID19 has shown that it is possible to generate efficiency gains by properly categorizing activities according to whether they can be carried out effectively face-to-face or remotely. 
 
A weak health sector carries a systemic risk that prevents UNICEF’s efforts from winning support for the cause of the children: COVID19 has revealed the significant risks that are associated with a precarious health system for national socio-economic progress. Any efforts to boost economic recovery would be futile if significant investments are not made to strengthen the health system capacities to contain epidemics in the future in Burkina Faso.
 
 Innovations
 
Village Savings and Loans Associations (VSLA): in order to sustain the post-ODF status of communities, two implementing partners (PLAN in the Est region and APS in the Centre-Ouest region) are testing VSLA systems. Project teams are providing women with technical and management skills to put in place VSLA in their communities. Women in each VSLA are trained and granted with revolving funds to invest for the improvement of their sanitation facilities towards standardized durable latrines. This experience has recently been launched and the results will be monitored and documented in 2021.
 
Nudging techniques for handwashing promotion/Innovations for WinS: a project on handwashing promotion through “Nudging” was piloted in the Est region in 2019. The technique relies on behavioural economics[2], where subtle changes in the environment are introduced while allowing people to make individual choices without affecting their freedom of action. At the end of the project, the children’s knowledge and attitude on handwashing during key moments improved from 69.34% to 92.27%, while handwashing practice improved by 22.10% after using the toilet. To make this technique accessible to all, a manual[3] was developed and distributed to schools and other key actors. This promising strategy for handwashing promotion in schools was highly applauded at regional level. UNICEF scaled up the project to additional 50 schools in Est and Centre-Ouest regions after the COVID-19 outburst for additional data generation to inform the sector about the innovative approach. More results will be available in the first trimester of 2021.
 
RapidPro for Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP): to strengthen the accountability towards affected populations, 25 municipalities in the Sahel region are testing a digital feedback mechanism on the quality of birth registration services using RapidPro. This system captures feedback on quality services, reported by 536 trained community leaders (including 141 women) on a quarterly basis. The information will be used by local authorities to identify service delivery-related bottlenecks and improve birth registration services. UNICEF is exploring the application of this real-time, participatory reporting system in other zones of limited access, to monitor the humanitarian situation and quality of emergency responses.
 
Mobile Journalism (MoJo): 18 youth from emergency areas were selected and trained on MoJo to create video human interest stories. The aim is to show the reality of young Burkinabè, using their own voice and views, and in areas difficult to access due to the security situation, including the 6 priority regions.
 
U-Partners and COVID-19: U-partners were deployed in the response against COVID-19. 5 volunteers have been working full time to reply on real time questions about COVID-19. This was accompanied by the launch of a chatbot to help youth understand the pandemic. UNICEF reached over 58,442 youth throughout the 13 regions of Burkina Faso. 
 
U-Report chatbots: throughout the year, 5 chatbots were launched through U-Report on different topics (COVID-19, immunization, nutrition, climate, menstrual hygiene) and 7 SMS-based live chats were organized with youth. Considering that young people demonstrated their interest in seeking and sharing information, the CO is planning to strengthen the initiative in the coming years, by supporting an existing real-time information centre for students, which is based at the Ministry of Education. 
 
mHealth COVID-19: during the COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF supported the Ministry of Health to launch a new version of data management system (mHealth) specific to COVID-19. This solution was used by over 100,000 people to check by themselves if they were developing COVID-19 symptoms for 14 days. The mHealth COVID-19 is being used by the CO’s team in charge of COVID-19 response to follow COVID-19 subject contact.

WCAR,Cabo Verde,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In this such a unique year, important lessons were learned.

What did work well:

Like other countries, Cabo Verde was also very affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the United Nations System was one of the first development partners in the country to respond to the Government's call for measures to mitigate the effects of the crisis. In this context, it is worth highlighting the joint and integrated response carried out by the United Nation’s Agencies in Cabo Verde, with emphasis on the three agencies of the Joint Office (UNDP, UNFPA and UNICEF). As an example, in the field of education and particularly with regard to children's food security, the joint intervention of UNICEF, UNDP and FAO resulted in the mobilization of resources that made it possible to ensure hot meals for about 30,000 children during the school break period, derived from the confinement imposed by the authorities. In the health field, joint interventions made by UNICEF and WHO have enabled the Government to achieve excellent results in combating the COVID-19 pandemic.

The participation of UNICEF staff in the multisectoral team set up by the government to elaborate the mechanisms for the allocation of social benefits in the framework of the social programmes created in response to COVID19 has enabled UNICEF to position itself among the government's main partners in the implementation of social programmes.
The pandemic situation created a greater institutional solidarity in terms of coordinating action on the field with the different sectors, such as the child protection services and the national police, with the health services, with the NGO´s, as well as the Ministry of justice services, etc.
Regular consultations with national partners resulted in greater agreement and commitment to the implementation of planned activities and, more importantly, the reprogramming of activities to meet the needs expressed in the context of the pandemic by the COVID19.
A ""new normal"" use of digital and remote communication platforms to monitor programs and activity plans allowed us to continue to implement our programmes, supporting the country and the most vulnerable with the aim at the 2030 Agenda.

What did not work so well:
The monitoring of program results and actions on the people for whom they are intended, due to the difficulties of travel and information/data collection in the context of the pandemic by COVID19. The country does not have procedures for monitoring or standards for emergency situations. Work needs to be done to ensure that minimum standards are agreed upon.

"
WCAR,Central African Republic,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"En 2020, l'UNICEF a lancé un programme couplant le traitement et la prévention de la MAS, avec le cash. Lors de la réalisation d'un exercice de suivi des utilisateurs finaux, il est apparu évident que parfois les mères répartissaient les aliments thérapeutiques prêts à l’emploi (RUTF) entre leurs enfants en raison du manque d'argent pour acheter de la nourriture pour tous leurs enfants, au lieu de la donner uniquement comme prescrit thérapeutiquement à l'enfant malnutri. Cela a alerté l’UNICEF qui teste la distribution de ‘cash’ ciblée, afin que les mères puissent utiliser de l’argent pour acheter de la nourriture pour le reste de la famille, tout en administrant le RUTF à l’enfant souffrant de malnutrition aigüe sévère seulement. Le programme est étroitement suivi et documenté et teste l’hypothèse selon laquelle la distribution en espèces diminuera la récidive de MAS. De plus, l’analyse de l’évolution et des tendances de la nutrition aigue et chronique des enfants en cours de finalisation va informer en 2021 la révision de la note stratégique nutrition, en collaboration avec le PAM et les autres acteurs.
 
Avec le Ministère de la santé et une ONG partenaire, l’UNICEF a développé de courtes vidéos pour sensibiliser la population aux mesures de prévention de la Covid-19. Dans un pays ou la pénétration de l’internet n’est qu’à 14% il n’est pas possible d’atteindre toute la population à travers les réseaux sociaux.  Ces vidéos ont été distribuées dans les kiosques où les gens ont été invités à les télécharger gratuitement. Au cours des cinq premiers mois, plus de 100,000 jeunes ont téléchargé ces vidéos gratuites sur leurs smartphones dans les 77 kiosques qui ont participé à l’initiative. Le bureau documentera cette méthode à faible coût, mais avec un fort potentiel de résultats, dans le but de décider s’il faut l’intensifier et l’utiliser à d’autres fins.
 
Les resultats préliminaires de la MICS6 2018-2019 indiquent des niveaux extrêmement faibles de vaccination des enfants en RCA, bien au-dessous des données de sources administratives. L’évaluation de la stratégie urbaine de la vaccination en cours de finalisation permettra de revoir la stratégie de l’UNICEF en matière d’immunisation dans le pays. 
 
Depuis 2019, l'UNICEF et l'Agence nationale de l’eau et de l’assainissement ont introduit une nouvelle technique de forage manuel dans les zones où ces technologies sont les plus appropriées. L'approche de forage manuel utilise des matériaux locaux, des équipements à faible coût et des opérateurs locaux à petite échelle pour réduire considérablement le coût du forage (environ 2,500 USD sans pompe à main). Cette solution à moindre coût est une alternative dans plusieurs villages situés dans des zones inondées et difficiles d'accès où les foreuses mécanisées habituelles ne peuvent pas être transportées, et pour les villages de petite population qui ne sont pas priorisés par les projets du gouvernement et des partenaires. Le programme de forage manuel impliquant 50 enfants libérés des groupes armés s'est poursuivi à Paoua. Cette initiative vise à promouvoir la génération de revenus pour ces enfants et leur intégration économique
 
Afin d’optimiser les ressources pour les livraisons offshores, le port de Kribi a été priorisé pour les expéditions internationales qui offrent 20 jours supplémentaires de free time (temps alloué pour le pick-up des conteneurs) par rapport au port de Douala, générant ainsi un gain de 10 à 15 jours sur le temps de transit et des économies de 72 dollars par conteneur. Les achats régionaux seront favorisés pour inclure d’autres fournitures stratégiques et renforcer la collaboration continue avec le centre de Douala afin de prépositionner les fournitures de secours en cas d’urgence. Dans la distribution des vaccins COVAX, un soutien est fourni au gouvernement pour la tenue des marchés publics et l’approvisionnement au niveau national. 
 
Malgré de nombreux efforts déployés au cours de l’année pour réintégrer les enfants autrefois associés à des groupes armés, il semble qu’un certain nombre d’entre eux aient été recrutés de nouveau en 2020. En 2021, l’UNICEF entamera une évaluation de son programme de réintégration afin d’éclairer les changements afin de le rendre plus efficace et durable.
 
De plus, le manque de données fiables et à jour reste une contrainte majeure à la programmation et au suivi des programmes. La mise en place d’un système permettant de renseigner quelques indicateurs standards au niveau des préfectures n’a pas connu d’avancées depuis 2018. Cette absence de progrès a conduit à un changement de stratégie qui privilégie désormais une remontée d’information pour des chiffres clés à travers les partenaires de mise en œuvre et le suivi sur le terrain. Le renforcement des systèmes des partenaires de mise en œuvre et de l’UNICEF pour la collecte, suivi et l’analyse des progrès vers les résultats clés pour les enfants (KRC) de façon régulière sera une priorité pour l’UNICEF en 2021.
 
En 2020, dans un contexte humanitaire et sécuritaire volatile et complexe, l’UNICEF et ses partenaires ont ainsi développé et commencé à mettre à l’échelle plusieurs innovations et renforcé les programmes intersectoriels afin d’atteindre plus d’enfants vulnérables et à risques de manière efficiente. En 2021, sur la base de ces expériences et leçons, l’UNICEF en RCA va renforcer les liens entre les interventions humanitaires et de développement, y compris à travers une programmation mieux informée par les risques et des données plus fiables autour des résultats clés pour les enfants. 

"
WCAR,Chad,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Expanding outreach through engagement with the private and non-profit sector. In 2020, by leveraging television and radio channels and youth associations, UNICEF reached an unprecedented 7 million people (44 per cent of the population) with COVID-19 prevention messages. The same channels were used to deliver information on the protection of children against violence, abuse and exploitation, given the increased risks arising from COVID protection measures (schools closed, social services reduced to a minimum, etc). Innovative use of mass communication should be pursued further, while addressing its limitations in a strongly patriarchal society, where the radio/TV is usually controlled by men. 
 
Retooling existing technology for the fight against COVID-19. Utilization of the GeneXpert equipment previously installed for HIV testing of newborns of HIV-positive mothers for COVID-19 testing facilitated decentralization of COVID-19 laboratory testing to nine provinces; and provided invaluable information to assist provincial authorities and local actors to design actions to curb COVID-19 transmission. 
Taking a leap forward in access to education through distance learning. UNICEF supported the Ministry of Education to turn the challenge of school closure into an opportunity to launch a distance learning programme in collaboration with a national NGO, TECHNIDEV. Distance learning has not previously been used in Chad, due to low internet coverage and a limited electricity network. Broadcast on radio and television, the distance learning programme enabled at least 400,553 students in the upper primary and secondary levels to complete the education cycle. This initiative has its limits, as children who accessed the platform tended to be more privileged children living in urban centres. Nonetheless it is a first step towards the future scale-up of distance learning programmes in Chad, including for students in hard-to-reach areas, and could serve as a platform for on-the-job teacher training. 
 
Strengthen quality data for decision-making in times of crisis. UNICEF further scaled up the implementation of EduTrack in 223 schools in two provinces with the aim of expanding it to other emergency affected areas. EduTrack uses SMS to collect real-time data, and is an effective data collection tool that complements the existing Education Management Information Systems and ensures access to education is monitored where children are the most vulnerable.  
 
Sand dykes for a sustainable, environmentally friendly water supply. UNICEF conducted the environmental and social assessment for the construction of the first sand dam in Chad. The dam will retain water for human and animal consumption and for replenishment of the aquifer. The village identified for the construction is in the arid province of Ouaddai where farmers and pastoralists often clash over access to water. 
 
 
Lessons Learned and Future Outlook  
 
Joint advocacy by Education partners for a steep sustained increase in government investment in the education sector is an absolute necessity
Notwithstanding improvements in students’ language skills (PASEC 2019), the upcoming distribution of schoolbooks, and the use of technology to deliver education remotely, the education sector may experience a crisis during the current and the next school year. Enrolment, retention and effective learning may all be at risk. In the current school year, almost 9,800 community teachers (33 per cent of the total) and about 2,800 contractual teachers were supported by the World Bank and 1088 contractual teachers by UNICEF.  If the external resources on which the education sector depends are no longer available, and government is not prepared to take over, there is a risk of major disruption of the education system. 
 
The education sector development Plan (PIET 2018-2020) has been extended until 2025, limiting the prospect for sector reform in the short term. Increased joint advocacy at the highest political level by the Local Education Group, of which UNICEF is a key member, with backing from the major donors is critical to finding a sustainable funding solution for the sector and avoiding a collapse of the education system.  
 
Rapid results at scale through community-based approaches and involvement of community leaders. The involvement and commitment of traditional chiefs (canton chiefs) has been a success factor in implementing the CLTS approach, which saw a jump in the number of people reached in 2020 in spite of COVID-19. Using their moral authority, traditional leaders have positively influenced behaviours, convinced their community about the health dangers of open defecation and generated the commitment to construct household latrines and bring villages to ODF status. Furthermore, community-based approaches in health have shown that engagement of the community strengthens community participation and ownership, increasing demand for and utilization of services, while securing sustainability of results. In Guera province this approach facilitated the rapid launch of community integrated management of childhood illness with administrative and health authorities to cover 147 remote villages, many located more than 10 km from a health centre. With UNICEF’s support, Chad is reviewing its Community Health Strategy paper ensuring close linkages with the country’s Universal Health Coverage strategy for long term sustainability, taking into account the recently completed district health mapping exercise, the strengthening of district health planning and effective use of Health Management Information System to reduce access barriers. 
 
In addition to leading the local COVID-19 response, UNICEF Field Offices played a critical role in supporting the ongoing implementation of the country Programme and strengthening humanitarian response including through support to local cluster mechanisms and close collaboration with provincial and district authorities. Lessons learned from the stock-taking of the multisectoral, multi-agency Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) in support of newly displaced communities in Lac province, supported by OCHA, WFP, UNICEF’s Bol Field Office, cluster leads, government and NGO partners, highlight the need to strengthen partnerships with local NGOs. The latter point is echoed in the evaluation of the humanitarian response conducted by UNICEF covering the period 2017-2019, which highlights that the partnership network convened by UNICEF at the local level extended the scope of actions, strengthened effectiveness of humanitarian interventions and secured greater impact. 
 
As we move into 2021, COVID-19 preparedness and recovery will be mainstreamed into the core business operations of UNICEF and integrated in 2021 workplans and constitutes an underlying assumption of HAC 2021.
 
 
 

"
WCAR,Congo,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Duty of Care. In the context of COVID-19, staff protection and safety have emerged as a priority for the Country Office (CO) management team throughout the year 2020. With the containment measures taken by the government to limit the spread of COVID-19, which hampered the implementation of the programmes, it was necessary to reimagine the working methods to reconcile the protection of the staff and the achievement of results for children. 
 
The CO stayed and delivered amid COVID-19 pandemic. Flexible work arrangements were put in place, and all measures taken to put into practice the UN protocol while supporting government efforts to respond to the pandemic and galvanising all partnerships and capacities to achieve results for children.

Transforming the crisis into an opportunity. The assessment of the socio-economic impacts of COVID in the Republic of Congo revealed the fragility of the health, education and social protection systems, as well as the resurgence of inequalities between different social groups. For UNICEF and the United Nations system, supporting the government was a unique chance to turn crisis into an opportunity for the establishment of a framework of policies and strategies genuinely focused on reducing inequalities and reimagining the fulfilment of the rights of children in Congo. For example, the current strategic axes of the National Development Plan provided a good platform for cooperation and coordination among UN agencies. weaknesses identified in the social protection systems will need to analysed as part of the mid-term review of the 2018-2022 National Development Plan. 

Also, UNICEF Congo was able to support the Government with innovative approaches that will be mainstreamed in 2021. One of these is the provision of distance learning through written press and media (radio and television). Despite the closure of all schools at the national level for 74 days (March 18 to May 31, 2020), home-based learning was key for the results achieved by nearly 297,000 children conducting official exams and to resume classes for one month before these exams. 

Data and evidence for improved advocacy, equity and protection. In its efforts to strengthen the data collection system, UNICEF created data analysis tools that have allowed to identify gaps in the health and protection sectors. For maternal and child health, the CO developed a Gap analysis tool.  This has enabled the provision of basic health interventions to the least covered localities which have been identified, segregated by region and type of intervention. A similar tool was tested in five cities that allowed health, social and justice services to share data that helped highlight cases of violence against children. This unveiled 88 cases of sexual violence to girls under ten years of age showing the need to have integrated and multisectoral reporting and case management mechanisms. 

UNICEF’s positioning as an evidence leader was highlighted with the presentation of the results of the Report on Gender-based violence in schools and online violence, during a high-level dialogue, a first timer in the country, during which children interacted directly with three Government ministers on this issue. The dialogue was recorded and will be used as advocacy material in 2021. As a result, multisectoral technical committee was set up that will roll-out the recommendations of the report.
 
Advocacy and Cross boarder collaboration between Government, UN and bilateral partners proved key to allow eight children victims of trafficking from Benin to be safely repatriated home. This would not have been possible without the involvement of both Governments, country offices and the Embassy of the United States.
 
Inclusiveness and a multisectoral approach facilitate decision making and action. For example, the multisectoral and holistic coordination between all stakeholders involved in addressing gender based-violence, facilitated the elaboration and endorsement of the National Gender-Based Violence (GBV) Strategy and a costed action plan. 
 
Going Forward. To continue with this line of work, and building on lessons learnt, UNICEF will produce several studies in 2021 including one on Child trafficking and another on street children, both in partnership with the Ministries of Justice, of Social Affairs and of Planning. In addition, under the coordination of WCARO, the country is engaged in the process of preparing three multi-country evaluations for KRC #1 (Immunisation), KRC #5 (violence) and for the response to COVID-19. These evaluations will further strengthen future programming to improve results for children.  
 
The VII mechanism will remain a vital platform for efficient and effective delivery of vaccines and essential health commodities. UNICEF will continue to play a critical role as a trusted partner in supplies procurement, including for COVID-19. UNICEF’s strategic position will further contribute to enhanced advocacy to secure domestic financing for priority programmes especially those that cover children. UNICEF will continue to strengthen the Government’s supply and procurement capacity and will coordinate with technical and financial partners such as Gavi, World Bank and the Global Fund to improve planning and prevent stock-outs, while promoting the allocation of national resources.
 
In hindsight, the CO was able to build the necessary pillars during the first year of the programme of cooperation on which the CO can continue to build on to accelerate results for children. However, considering the contextual environment and the socio-economic impact of COVID-19, it is key that UNICEF and the UN system focus more on supporting the Government to generate and allocate domestic resources for essential social services. Such resilient and decisive measure from government will prevent deterioration of key indicators towards the achievement of SDGs by 2030.  
"
WCAR,Cote D'Ivoire,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"1. Scaling-up of existing innovations: In 2020, the partnership with the Conceptos Plásticos Foundation, which started in 2018, was strengthened. The project was impacted by COVID-19, with important delays in the setup of the factory, which is now fully functional, and the production of recycled plastic bricks. In total, 45 out of the 90 recycled plastic brick kits expected by the end of December 2020 were delivered, and 32 classrooms were built, recycling 290 tonnes of plastic waste while providing classrooms to over 2,900 children. In addition, three storage units for mosquito nets were constructed with recycled plastic bricks in preparation for the 2021 LLIN distribution campaign.  
Digital payments introduced in 2018 through Mobile Money were scaled up in 2020 with the Country Office establishing a long-term agreement with Mobile Network Operators such as MTN. In 2020, the Country Office transferred USD 4.8 million directly to over 40,000 beneficiaries, mainly for Health, Protection, and Education interventions. Digital payments have significantly reduced the transactional costs associated with the payment of beneficiaries. In addition to the routine use of Mobile Money, the Country Office used digital cash transfers to support front-line social workers to provide real-time assistance to children in need during the COVID-19 pandemic and the electoral crisis. The creation of a WhatsApp group for social workers was an effective tool for real-time communication and follow-up during the electoral period.
In 2020, the Country Office leveraged RapidPro (a real-time monitoring open-source software) to support programme activities, including the COVID-19 response through the COVID-19 information centre which provided accurate, up-to-date information on the pandemic. RapidPro was also used to support the HIV U-Test project, the EduTrac initiative that supports and strengthens education systems, and the monitoring of birth registrations. The Country Office’s partnership with Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) was key to supporting the Government’s awareness raising efforts. In-kind donation of services allowed the Country Office to send bulk SMS for free, build an SMS-based information centre, address fake news thanks to free internet bandwidth provided to young bloggers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Country Office achieved a cumulative reach of over 355 million hits mainly thanks to its partnerships with media (Canal+ and RTI) and MNOs.
The Country Office engaged with the young U-Reporters in the implementation of programmes activities, such as the third-party field monitoring of the vitamin A supplementation campaign conducted by 241 U-Reporters, which allowed to survey 7,713 households in real-time during four days at a low price. This resulted in a low level of refusals due to COVID-19, a high coverage of vitamin A supplementation, and an acceptable level of compliance of prevention measures by health agents and community health workers.
2. New innovations: In collaboration with UNICEF HQ and WCARO, the Country Office implemented the U-Test project using innovative approaches that combined social networking (mainly through U-Report) and outreach approaches to optimize HIV self-testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis among at-risk adolescents. A total of 23,844 adolescents and youths benefitted from combined HIV prevention services (sexuality and behaviour change communication, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), condoms, lubricant, HIV self-tests, and comprehensive sexuality education). In addition, 6,229 self-tests kits were distributed to adolescents and youths, 40% of whom were from key populations, and 101 most-at-risk adolescents and youths were successfully enrolled in PrEP programmes. Using KoBoCollect, geo-localization was strengthened, which allowed to collect and analyse data in real-time and estimate the size of beneficiaries in project implementation areas.
As part of the COVID-19 response, the Country Office supported local enterprises to develop and procure local reusable paediatric masks with support from the Regional Office and the Supply Division. The Country Office also worked with local enterprises to develop contactless handwashing stations adapted to school environments.
The COVID-19 pandemic was an opportunity for the Country Office to reimagine its way of working and ensure that it continues to deliver results for children. Notable efforts were made to increase efficiency in the office, including flexible work arrangements, and better ICT equipment. Tools and processes were adjusted in response to the COVID-19 context, such as the massive use of virtual meeting platforms (Zoom, Teams, and Skype) for coordination meetings, the use of Google Forms, online data collection, and real-time monitoring (with RapidPro). These are major assets that will be leveraged to optimize the use of programme resources and enhance the efficiency of the 2021-2025 CPD. The clarification of roles and responsibilities for the emergency response under the leadership of the RCO and the setup of thematic emergency groups (four of which were led by the Country Office) are key to increase the level of preparedness and improve the response to other emergencies, including the Central Sahel crisis.
"
WCAR,Democratic Republic of Congo,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In 2020, facing multiple, overlapping crises and outbreaks, UNICEF is particularly proud of two innovative approaches that proved efficient to transform children’s lives in the DRC.
The Social Sciences Analytics Cell (CASS) 
The use of systematic and integrated social science analyses to better understand epidemiological trends in outbreaks was a unique and innovative outcome of the 10th Ebola outbreak in the eastern DRC. The Social Sciences Analytics Cell (CASS) has been unique in its service-based evidence for action platform; not only collecting data but ensuring these data are presented across multiple fora and locations to drive programs that are more adapted to the communities they seek to reach. The CASS works with different response actors to support the use of evidence for action, contributing to a more informed and accountable outbreak response. This, for example, resulted in 112 codeveloped recommendations during the eastern DRC Ebola outbreak. Some key examples of evidence and action from 2020 include: 
    
(1)    Integrated analytics found that children under 5 were less likely to be listed as Ebola contacts, followed up when listed, or identified as cases. Based on this evidence, training packages for surveillance and psychosocial teams as well as healthcare workers were adapted, and communication materials developed to better communicate on potential risks and symptoms among children under 5.
(2)    Evidence found that the lack of communication materials explaining all of the Ebola symptoms resulted in delayed treatment-seeking, increased refusal for Ebola burials and distrust of Ebola response teams. To address this, communication materials were adapted to account for more common and less severe symptoms to reinforce healthcare seeking and engagement with response interventions. Over the course of the outbreak, the delays in treatment-seeking reduced by more than half.
(3)    Analytics found that since the COVID-19 pandemic began, those living with diabetes in Kinshasa were decreasing their use of diabetes services due to fear of contracting COVID-19 or being quarantined. To address this, free testing and treatment were set up and communication materials to specifically address protecting those living with comorbidities were developed by the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization, supported by UNICEF. 
As the DRC faces multiple concurrent outbreaks, Public Health Emergencies (PHE) in the context of conflict, population displacement, limited access to essential services and a weak health system, UNICEF DRC has invested in both scaling up the scope, and nationalizing the CASS unit. 
The CASS success has further resulted in the setup of a global working group for integrated social sciences in outbreaks, under the Global Outbreak Alert Response Network (GOARN) and led by the DRC-CASS team. The DRC CASS is working with GOARN and UNICEF’s global Public Health Emergency team to institutionalize training and deployment of integrated analytic teams in all future public health emergencies.
Modular and Sustainable Classrooms 
Following the interethnic conflict in the Kasai Central and Oriental provinces that resulted in the destruction of over 250 schools, UNICEF built 340 classrooms, supporting over 30,000 children to regain access to education. During this process, UNICEF DRC faced several challenges including a lack of contextual analysis and response modalities, high construction costs, delays in implementation, unfit technical solutions, and a disregard for local and sustainable solutions.
To address these, from July to September 2020, UNICEF developed and prototyped a modular sustainable school to provide a more accurate response to the country’s requirements for both adequate school infrastructure and efficient and rapid response capacity. The model is designed to adapt to most conditions - from rapid response phases through transition and development- and most contexts. It can be tailored to all locally available materials, while adhering to national standards for education infrastructure and maintaining low costs and rapid implementation modalities. From one intervention phase to the next, the school can easily be upgraded with locally available material: This sustainable mechanism promotes longer-term ownership from beneficiaries, contributes to reduced carbon emissions in the construction lifecycle, and fosters local economic development. Costs start at only $USD 4,000 per classroom - 3 classrooms per unit - which can be set up in a few weeks. In December 2020, the Ministry of Education approved this solution as an addition to the national applicable standards for school construction in the DRC. 
In its Humanitarian Needs Overview for DRC, UNOCHA highlighted that an additional 28,000 classrooms were needed across the country to face increased demand from students as a result of the implementation of the Free Primary Education reform. UNICEF has since called for multi-year action from the entire aid community to meet those needs in the next three years and has committed to the construction of 1,000 classrooms in 2021. 
All necessary technical documentation to replicate this innovation will be shared electronically through open sources and on a dedicated education TV channel, “EDUCTV”, to be used by all in-country education sector actors."
WCAR,Equatorial Guinea,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"While the pandemic caused disruptions and required UNICEF to adjust its programme with the Government to mitigate the impact on children and adolescents, it also created space for innovations and for continuing our advocacy on child rights issues. For example, the implementation of the first phase of the Social Guarantees Programme for vulnerable families relaunched the establishment of a social protection system. The risk of having children not being able to receive education because of school closure helped reopen the discussion on out of school children. The distance learning also highlighted the importance of addressing the digital divide and inequities as over 20% do not have access to radio or television while only 26.2% have access to internet.
 
The office remained very functional during the pandemic through teleworking and by doing pre-testing to ensure connections, providing staff with high-speed internet as needed. UNICEF also advocated for Government counterparts to attend key meetings online to ensure continuity. This experience has helped to build trust and prepare for another eventual emergency.
 
The Country had its first national measles campaign in four years but the coverage was less than expected. It was partly due to the delay in implementing the social mobilization campaign but it also highlighted a problem of coordination and supervision at the field level. On the other hand, good planning made it possible to have all the antigens available and to avoid stock-out during immunization activities. The planned multi-country evaluation on routine immunization, which includes Equatorial Guinea, should help identify and address some of the routine vaccination service bottlenecks. 
 
The Child-Friendly District Initiative showed that the use of community registers contributed to foster ownership among community leaders and a mean to help mobilize communities for vaccination or other activities. 
 
In terms of innovations, to strengthen efficiency and transparency in transferring funds to counterparts and partners, the CO collaborated with the Ministry of Health to pilot a Mobile Money scheme through signing an agreement with the mobile phone operating company MUNI. Through UNICEF’s support, the Ministry of Health held a national vaccination campaign to reach unvaccinated children in all 18 districts. For the campaign, the involved health workers and volunteers’ incentives were paid through MUNI Dinero (Mobile Money). As a pilot of its first kind in the country, this payment modality was deemed as a success by multiple parties. By using MUNI Dinero, both unbanked or underbanked health workers and volunteers (including those in remote areas) timely received their incentives in a trackable manner while applying a paperless process. Moreover, verification processes to enable transactions further strengthened accountabilities as recipients are required to have identity documents and are given unique security codes. Through UNICEF’s negotiations with the MUNI, the CO obtained a competitive transaction cost at 3% which was a win. 
 
Based on these experiences, the CO will explore the expansion of this paying scheme to other sectors such as education and social protection. The lessons will also be reviewed before the expansion. For example, a minority of the participants did not have identity documents and had to rely on senior government officials’ MUNI dinero accounts. Nevertheless, UNICEF’s verification report confirms that all 130 participants received the transactions as planned. 
 
To ensure continued learning during the COVID-19 pandemic when all schools were closed, UNICEF worked with the Ministry of Education and launched the country’s first distance education through TV and radio for preschool and primary school children. The Government estimates that 127,000 (78%) students in preschool and primary are reached. The TV and radio learning programmes were broadcasted three times a week. The radio programmes were also live which allowed users to call in for clarifications and feedback which was a welcomed component. However, the content of the materials remained somewhat limited and the frequency of broadcasting was insufficient for each grade. UNICEF will further work with the Ministry of Education to improve quality. While the schools are re-opened, the distance education through TV and radio is planned to continue. These platforms reinforce the basics in Maths and Spanish and other subjects which are beneficial to strengthen foundational learning. Moreover, the programmes are expected to reach students and beyond, including out of school children, elderly and wider communities.
  
The CO collaborated with UNICEF Cameroon to order directly from Cameroonian factories and providers to procure hand sanitizers and buckets at a reduced-price. For cost efficiency and timely deliveries in emergencies, the CO exceptionally used local boats from Douala to Malabo, signing a contract with a trader to cover the potential risks of the shipment from UNICEF hub warehouse in Douala to the Equatorial Guinea UNICEF’s partner warehouse. Through using this unusual mode of transport, the CO secured timely supplies donated to the Government and distributed to vulnerable children and population affected by COVID-19. 
 
With restricted movements due to lockdown and confinement measures, the CO has been reviewing the possibilities for electronic payments with a local bank. The processes are still ongoing at time of writing this report. Meanwhile and as advised by DFAM’s banking unit, the CO signed a short-term agreement allowing payments instruction to be sent to the bank via e-mail during the lockdown. A call back process (in addition to the email) has been put in place to verify the authenticity of the email received by the bank. 
 
The reduced RR ceiling for 2021 due to the advance of RR allocation loaned to the CO to settle retroactive payment to national staff coupled with the challenge to mobilize COVID non-related OR in 2020 will require the office to make additional adjustment to its structure. This will also be informed by the planned mid-term review and review of UNICEF strategic positioning in the country. The CO will spare no effort in implementing its resource mobilization strategy including landscaping non-traditional partners while continuing to work with UN Agencies for joint programming and fund raising.

WCAR,Gabon,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"SuperMwana/1412 : Une innovation pour lutter contre les violences sur les enfants
 
Le plaidoyer et l'appui technique de l'UNICEF au Gouvernement gabonais dans la lutte contre les violences sur les enfants ont franchi une étape irréversible le 20 novembre 2020. Lors de la Journée Internationale des Droits de l’Enfant (JIDE), le Ministre de la justice, le Ministre des affaires sociales et le Représentant Adjoint de l'UNICEF ont lancé le premier centre d’appel entièrement dédié aux enfants victimes de violences. La pandémie de COVID-19, et la distanciation sociale qui s’en est suivi, ont entraîné la fermeture des services publics de protection des enfants pendant les cinq premiers mois du grand confinement. Cette crise sanitaire a amené les responsables de la protection de l'enfance à comprendre le besoin urgent d'un numéro vert qui peut sauver des vies dans les familles. Le besoin et le projet n'étaient pas nouveaux. 
 
1412 ou SuperMwana est aussi une réponse aux observations faites au Gabon en 2016 par le Comité des droits de l'enfant sur l'obligation de créer des lignes d'assistance pour améliorer la prise en charge des enfants face aux cas de violence physique, d'abus sexuel, de crime rituel, et de toute autre forme de violation des droits de l'enfant dans des zones où les travailleurs sociaux et les policiers ne peuvent intervenir à temps pour sauver des vies. En outre, l'étude nationale de 2010 sur toutes les formes de violences au Gabon avait démontré que le silence était une pratique culturelle dominante au sein des ménages où les familles parlent à peine des souffrances des enfants. Par conséquent, la création de SuperMwana/1412, une ligne gratuite et facile à retenir pourrait aider les victimes et les témoins à appeler et à dénoncer les contrevenants en témoignant aux professionnels de la protection de l'enfance. Ce numéro vert dispose de fonctionnalités permettant la sécurisation, le stockage des données et informations, et ainsi que de procédures spécifiques pour l’accès et l’exploitation de la base de données. Pendant les 40 premiers jours de fonctionnement du centre d'appels, le ministère de la Justice a signalé 1264 appels reçus, parmi lesquels 6 cas de viols sur mineurs, 6 cas de harcèlement contre de mineures, 14 cas de violences physiques, 19 cas de maltraitance, 19 cas d'abandon d'enfants.
 
En 2021, le plan prévoit de sensibiliser davantage les populations sur l'importance d'utiliser le centre d'appels pour protéger les enfants et de signaler des cas aux acteurs du système de protection de l'enfance. De même, de futurs appuis viseront le renforcement de la prise en charge et la protection des victimes et témoins à travers un système de référence vers les services appropriés. Enfin, pour permettre une meilleure interaction avec une jeunesse de plus en plus connectée, une application mobile sera développée pour faciliter le signalement, la collecte et le partage par voie digitale de « moyens de preuves » contre les violences.
 
Réorientation de l’initiative « Villes et Communautés Amies des Enfants » pour répondre à la COVID-19 : Une leçon apprise pour renforcer la programmation en milieu urbain et contribuer à l’initiative « Villes Résilientes »
 
Au terme de la troisième année du cycle de programme, d’importantes leçons ont été tirées de l’adaptation des programmes et partenariats existants pour augmenter  les résultats et l’impact de l’action de l’UNICEF et de ses partenaires. 
 
Les partenariats stratégiques multidimensionnels développés à mi-parcours du Programme de Coopération ont eu un impact significatif en 2020 et ont mis en exergue tout leur potentiel tant pour répondre à des goulots d’étranglements systémiques et structurels qui entravent la réalisation des droits de l’enfant que pour faire face à des urgences humanitaires émergentes et imprévues.  
L’adaptation à la riposte contre la COVID-19 de  l’Initiative « Villes et Communautés Amies des Enfants » est riche d’enseignements. Le plan d’action élaboré en 2019 avec la Mairie de Libreville pour l’opérationnalisation de ce partenariat a été réorienté vers une riposte rapide à la pandémie COVID-19 dans un environnement urbain et péri-urbain où les services sociaux essentiels sont limités et inéquitablement répartis. 
   
Aussi, ce réajustement programmatique avait pour but essentiel de contenir la propagation du virus et de limiter son impact à travers des interventions intégrées et systématiques tout en renforçant les systèmes et les capacités de la Mairie à répondre à des urgences humanitaires et à mettre en place des interventions durables au bénéfice des enfants. 
 
Conformément à l’Axe 4 du ‘’Programme pour les Enfants’’ la dimension vulnérabilité a été au centre de cette approche avec l’appui aux femmes et aux personnes vivant avec handicap en vue de renforcer leur autonomie et leur résilience durant la pandémie et au-delà à travers des activités génératrices de revenu. L’intégration de la dimension humanitaire au sein des priorités communales a montré toute son effectivité. Cette option stratégique et programmatique a renforcé l’intersectorialité au sein du Bureau (KRCs vaccination, enregistrement des naissances, lutte contre les violences) en raison du fait que les missions de la Mairie couvrent divers aspects des droits de l’enfant. 
 
De même, l’accueil favorable des interventions par des populations et le ciblage des zones urbaines défavorisées ont renouvelé le besoin d’une programmation en milieu urbain dans les plans annuels de travail du Bureau. Cette démarche correspond également à une approche axée sur l’équité qui visent en priorité les zones et les populations urbaines défavorisées dont le nombre augmente au fur et à mesure de l’accentuation des difficultés macro-économiques du pays. 
 
Les interventions exécutées ont permis à l’UNICEF et à la Mairie de repositionner l’Intérêt Supérieur de l’Enfant au centre des Plans de Développement Communaux et des mécanismes de cohésion sociale de proximité. Des progrès enregistrés constituent une étape vers la capacitation des exécutifs municipaux pour intégrer la préparation et la réponse aux urgences dans leurs politiques et plans de développement communaux. À terme, il s’agit pour l’UNICEF d’accompagner les villes et les communautés à construire des villes plus résilientes et mettant au centre de leurs préoccupations la résorption des chocs qui affectent durablement les plus vulnérables en milieu urbain."
WCAR,Gambia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The complexity and challenges of 2020, most, but not all, related to the COVID-19 pandemic, confirmed UNICEF’s adaptability to the paradigm shifts that are required in order to reach the most vulnerable children with enhanced results.  Lessons learned will be instrumental for the 2021 annual planning process and to inform the new country programme milestones.  
 
The Gambia is rich in policy frameworks in most areas pertaining to children’s rights.  In large measure, the positive progress attained in 2020 against Key Results for Children were enabled by specific laws, plans and protocols.  Nonetheless, it is significant that this framework has not translated into measurable improvements in complex areas such as social and behavioral change and prevention of violence against children and women, amongst others. This affords UNICEF the opportunity to ensure that all programmes have clearly defined interventions to ensure that policies are accompanied by improved capacity building, financing, monitoring and evaluation strategies.  Furthermore, as demonstrated by GCO’s emerging work in social protection and public financing for children, the efficiency and effectiveness of existing social sector responses can be improved by promoting a dual approach of promoting universal interventions for all children complemented by focalized interventions for specific groups of excluded children. 
 
The fact that the country had never faced a large-scale humanitarian crisis before COVID-19, underscored the scarcity of humanitarian response and coordination structures. Existing coordination structures were largely sectoral or thematic in nature; therefore, the type of multisectoral coordination structures required to address a multidimensional emergency such as COVID-19 were non-existent. UNICEF and other UN agencies were instrumental in supporting the establishment of effective coordination structures by engaging a variety of governmental and non-governmental stakeholders, which also contributed to breaking down sectoral silos and introducing multidimensional approaches to problem solving.  UNICEF’s leadership in supporting the RCCE and social services sectors not only allowed for the identification of resource leveraging opportunities, but also for calling on different stakeholders to work more closely together in areas pertaining to children.  Closely related to this lesson was the criticality of having a single national plan with clear remits to avoid duplications, parallel actions and community fatigue, which would in turn guarantee higher impact.  Moving forward, this presents important opportunities for GCO to invest in strengthening the humanitarian-development nexus, accompanied by rigorous capacity building at local, regional and national levels. 
 
Notwithstanding the relative success of strengthening coordinating mechanisms, UNICEF had to constantly remind partners of the importance of not leaving children behind in the response and for interventions to be based on human rights and the life-cycle approach.  This experience underlines UNICEF’s relevance and leadership to ensure that integrated child-centered approaches are implemented to resolve multidimensional problems that affect children. 
 
T4D was significantly boosted through the use of U-Report and Rapid Pro as tools to inform planning and policy processes.  Rapid Pro was launched during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic and was integrated into the Social and Behavioral Change Communication manual to support reporting on Key Results for Children (KRC), whilst U-Report was utilized by the Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education to plan its distance learning programme and to obtain opinions regarding the safe reopening of schools.  The revamped website was singled out by Facebook as the only local website for reliable information on COVID-19.  T4D can therefore play a strategic role in mobilizing local participation; communicating complex issues in a simple manner; influencing policy design; and improving scope, reach and scale of programme interventions. However, it must be systematically included in all country programme processes, as well as more regularly “loaned out” to partners in order to tap into its fullest potential. 
 
The Nsa Kenno initiative is a structured approach to engage and empower communities and demonstrates the nascent country programme capacities around innovations programming.  This initiative has been pivotal in strengthening the participation of local level actors in village and community governance structures and in multisectoral planning processes to generate responses to the most pressing challenges facing children and adolescents as identified by the communities themselves.  Not only has local planning influenced regional planning, but it has also positively affected national level decisions related to resource allocations.  This bottom-up methodology has shifted government’s approach regarding decentralized and local governance and has narrowed the distance between national and local entities.  A relevant lesson is the need to develop real-time monitoring tools to gauge the impact of these innovations on community empowerment and improvement indicators in order to take faster corrective actions rather than wait for the results of longer evaluation processes.  As the country programme begins to support additional innovations, it is important to develop theories of change that identify the inputs required to influence the transition from pilots to candidates for national upscaling that are part of the policy framework, requiring more investment to build UNICEF’s internal capacities on innovations programming.
 
With 37% of the population between the ages of 15-35 years, there is a tremendous opportunity for UNICEF to strengthen youth-focused approaches.  The programme has already yielded positive returns through the Children National Assembly, young U-Reporters, as well as youth participation informing development processes (such as the UN Common Country Analysis and forthcoming Sustainable Development Framework and the CPD) and resource mobilization exercises.  UNICEF should seize on structured initiatives, such as Generation Unlimited and the Global Volunteer Initiative, to tap into youth’s potential as change actors in areas such as entrepreneurship, climate change and social cohesion.  Similar opportunities abound to amplify existing initiatives for young influencers, including UNICEF youth ambassadors, to mobilize and empower young people as change agents. 
 
The demonstrated capacity of GCO to reach a growing audience with key messages for social and behavioral change through traditional and social media platforms represents a powerful asset that needs to be consolidated. Deepening the reach and scope of advocacy and communications strategies will require more investment in the development of creative campaign concepts informed by original and innovative content and assets for more impactful messaging in tandem with existing and new partnerships and alliances. 
"
WCAR,Ghana,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"A mid-term review of the UNICEF-Government of Ghana Country Programme of Cooperation (2018-2022) was convened in 2020 to assess progress towards results for children within the evolving programme context, including through the COVID-19 pandemic. The following indicative lessons learned reflect the observed challenges, innovations and opportunities discussed, grounded in past research and evaluation, and in recent implementation experience. 


Limited fiscal space in the social sector undercuts opportunities to promote national dialogue on child-responsive inclusive development. Voices of citizens, especially adolescents, youth and women, need to be further integrated into the planning and budget process through innovative social accountability initiatives that promote access to financial data and information relevant to their well-being and needs. 
A wealth of survey data is produced in Ghana, but routine monitoring systems suffer from capacity limitations and design constraints, and evaluation is underutilized as an approach to inform policy decisions. The adoption of innovative strategies to strengthen administrative data systems and institutional capacity with government partners will be critical to further progress. Recent experience from the implementation of rapid COVID-19 impact assessments suggest the need for due consideration of national and sub-national networks and coordination capacities.  


The expected socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 have highlighted the need to strengthen the preparedness of the social protection system to respond to shocks and crises. LEAP has been effective in supporting the most vulnerable families during the early stages of the pandemic and requires stronger and more consistent linkages with other complementary programmes and services. The cash transfers continue to have positive impacts poverty, food security, health access and dimensions of maternal health and women’s well-being. On innovation, UNICEF supported guidance and communications materials for frontline staff and beneficiaries on safe movement during the pandemic, with a top-up amount added to cover beneficiary travel. To meet the need for rapid feedback on payments, UNICEF worked with the Government LEAP Unit to deploy U-report in gathering feedback from district social welfare officers, community focal points, and beneficiaries. UNICEF supported CSOs to conduct independent monitoring which provided valuable information that could be triangulated to monitor both how the programme was being delivered with COVID-19 modifications and to understand whether these transfers were helpful to beneficiaries. Both approaches were used in subsequent rounds of transfers. 


Evidence generated by the country programme suggests that adolescent pregnancy is a major driver of child marriage, rather than child marriage being predominantly a matter of negative social norms. While the country programme was effective in building knowledge and changing attitudes through mass community engagement, changes in knowledge and attitudes have not produced a corresponding level of change in practice – particularly with respect to violence against children. There is also further need for capacity development particularly among informal social welfare actors. COVID-19 related statistics on violence also highlight the fragility of progress on gender equality and suggest that interventions designed to empower adolescent girls should be scaled up, not only to build their resilience in emergencies but also to ensure their right to full participation in society and more equal futures.   


Weak resiliency planning in the Education sector was highlighted at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, pointing to the need for more integrated and widespread planning around Education in Emergencies. Faster adaptation to the needs of out-of-school learners is required, along with the reduction of the digital divide. Provision for continuous learning needs to be sustainably integrated and adapted into preparedness and response activities. The lesson is applicable across sectors, including WASH.


Partnerships with International Financial Institutions, development partners and CSOs has been critical in leveraging resources for Ghana and advancing results. For example, UNICEF worked collaboratively with the World Bank and other DPs to develop a successful application to Global Partnership for Education (GPE) for Accelerated Funds of $15 million. This has supported the COVID-19 response in the sector and ensured an equity perspective in the approved programme. Also, the availability of standby agreements with key NGOs was key in initiating critical response actions, in a context where national preparedness and response is limited due the low incidence of emergencies. There is a need for deliberate advocacy and capacity strengthening to enhance the resilience of social services and the availability of technical and financial resources for emergency coordination, preparedness and response. The engagement of CSOs in risk communication and community engagement ensured the relevance and ownership of COVID-19 interventions and helped to identify and react to key behavioral barriers and facilitators. Engagement was key to sustain the gains of polio campaigns and to promote routine immunization.


There are several challenges in the nutrition sector. While the country has strong nutrition policies and strategies in place, they are under-funded, resulting in weak implementation and monitoring. There is no national multi-sectoral costed nutrition strategy or plan. There is weak enforcement of food fortification standards and legislation. Few nutrition indicators are integrated in national systems and tracked. However, a strong nutrition workforce and several nutrition partners can be leveraged. More effort is required to ensure multi-sectoral programming that will include food, WASH and social protection to ensure better nutrition outcomes. 


The experience of implementing the Basic Sanitation Fund (BSF) in three municipalities shows that poor-families are willing to invest in household latrines if capital is more-easily available and interest rates and payment terms are within reach.  UNICEF learned that urban households need information on appropriate technologies, information on the availability of latrine products and services and supported with by-laws and regulations discouraging OD practices. Sanitation businesses still need significant support from the public sector to generate demand for latrines in communities and to borrow money. In the current context of high-cost borrowing (over 30% interest), sanitation businesses are not sustainable independently. UNICEF has coordinated with UN Agencies, the World Bank and DPs to jointly address these challenges.

UNICEF in Ghana will continue to incorporate lessons learned into future programme strategies to advance important gains for children across the UNICEF Strategic Plan Goal Areas and five regional KRCs in 2020 (see Major Contributions and Drivers for Results).

WCAR,Guinea,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Obtenir des résultats pour  les enfants et les femmes pendant la pandémie de COVID-19
  
Pour s’adapter au nouveau  contexte créé par la COVID-19, l'UNICEF a rapidement revu - en conduisant une  analyse de criticalité des programmes - ses stratégies et ses modalités de  travail interne et externe pour appuyer le Gouvernement dans la réponse à la  COVID-19, assurer efficacement la continuité des services et favoriser un  relèvement durable et résilient. 
  
Au niveau des stratégies, la  priorisation a porté sur une riposte à la COVID-19 sensible au genre et à la  consolidation de la paix, l’intensification du plaidoyer pour gagner le  soutien des décideurs et du grand public sur l’impact de la COVID-19 sur les enfants;  une attention accrue à la mobilisation des ressources et des partenariats, les  programmes conjoints avec les autres agences des Nations Unies, les innovations  dans la programmation, et  l’utilisation  de la puissance des évidences  pour  susciter des changements en faveur des enfants. 
  
Ces stratégies ont permis de  mobiliser des ressources financières conséquentes, de renforcer la  mobilisation communautaire et le partenariat avec le Gouvernement et des  donateurs clés (Banque Mondiale, GAVI et Partenariat Mondial pour  l’Education). Ces stratégies - qui demeurent centrales dans la théorie de  changement du Programme - se sont avérées adaptées et efficaces dans l’appui  au Gouvernement pour contenir la pandémie. Elles n’ont cependant pas produit  les effets escomptés pour l’accélération des résultats clés tels que la  vaccination, les résultats d’apprentissage et l’enregistrement des  naissances. Cette limite pourrait être atténuée en 2021 par une meilleure  intégration de la réponse COVID-19 aux autres services et secteurs.
  
En ce qui concerne les  modalités de travail, l’UNICEF a adopté en 2020 de nouvelles approches (télétravail,  réunions virtuelles, formations en ligne, digitalisation des documents,  signatures électroniques) à l’interne et avec les partenaires. Ces modalités  ont permis d’atténuer les risques de contamination du personnel, de respecter  les directives du Gouvernement et d’assurer une exécution efficiente du  programme malgré des retards.
  
Les nouvelles modalités de  travail ont facilité pour l’UNICEF une gestion concomitante de la réponse à la  COVID-19 et des activités critiques du programme régulier. Les formations en  ligne ont permis à un plus grand nombre de professionnels d’en bénéficier tout  en réduisant considérablement les coûts. Cependant, le passage au travail  virtuel au quotidien avec le Gouvernement et les autres partenaires ne s’est  pas fait sans difficultés. L’UNICEF et ses partenaires n'étaient pas préparées  à passer à ce mode de travail tant sur le plan des compétences, des  équipements que de l’environnement numérique en général. Les contraintes  enregistrées dans cette expérience impliquent la nécessité de soutenir les  partenaires pour renforcer leurs capacités et institutionnaliser ces  approches. 
  
Produire rapidement des  données et des évidences pendant la pandémie de COVID-19
  
L'UNICEF a contribué, aux  côtés de partenaires clés, à la documentation des effets de la COVID-19 sur les  enfants et leurs familles à travers trois études rapides, réalisées par le  biais d'enquêtes téléphoniques et de questionnaires électroniques. Il s’agit  de l’étude d’impact de la COVID-19 sur l’économie guinéenne, l’enquête  rapide sur les effets de la COVID-19 : une perspective genre, et  l’étude socio-anthropologique sur les attitudes des populations par  rapport aux mesures de prévention et de distanciation relatives à la COVID-19  en république de Guinée.
  
L'UNICEF a également collecté  mensuellement des données sur les performances des interventions liées à la  COVID-19. Ces données ont été utilisées pour produire et diffuser  mensuellement des rapports de situation (SitReps) COVID-19, et alimenter le  tableau de bord global sur les performances de l’Organisation. 
  
Ces expériences ont montré  qu’il était possible de produire des évidences solides dans des délais  courts, lorsqu’on allie l’utilisation des innovations technologiques, au  pragmatisme dans les méthodes de collecte et la disponibilisation rapide des  données. L'UNICEF continuera à promouvoir la production rapide et efficiente d’évidences  solides sur les questions émergentes liées aux droits de l'enfant.
  
Réinventer le système  éducatif guinéen pour « ne laisser aucun enfant guinéen derrière »
  
Avec la fermeture des écoles  (mars-octobre 2020), la COVID-19 a montré les limites d’une éducation  uniquement basée sur le présentiel. La stratégie adoptée pour assurer la continuité  des apprentissages (fourniture de matériel d'auto-apprentissage, de programmes  éducatifs via les radios, la télévision et les réseaux sociaux) s’est heurtée  à plusieurs défis. Ces difficultés ont fortement compromis l'impératif de « ne  laisser aucun enfant guinéen de côté », et ont exacerbé les faiblesses  systémiques du secteur éducatif guinéen. 
  
La pandémie constitue une  opportunité pour « mieux » reconstruire et de façon « plus  équitable » le système éducatif. Elle montre la nécessité d’investir  dans la formation à distance comme réponse à des situations de crise ou en complément  aux mécanismes actuels d’enseignement. Cette orientation offre les gages d’un  système plus inclusif et résilient pour les enfants au sein et en dehors du  système éducatif. Elle contribuerait aussi à renforcer l’appropriation  nationale et la redevabilité mutuelle pour la réalisation des droits des  enfants à l’éducation. En 2021, le principal chantier de l’UNICEF dans le  domaine de l’éducation sera d’aider le MENA dans la digitalisation du secteur  et la promotion d’une éducation à distance de qualité - en complément de  celle présentielle, en inscrivant des initiatives à fort potentiel comme la  radio scolaire dans une perspective de pérennisation 
  
Perspectives stratégiques pour 2021
  
Tirant les leçons de la mise  en œuvre du programme en 2020, l’UNICEF va concentrer ses efforts en 2021 sur  les priorités suivantes :
  
§  Amélioration de l’excellence dans la  programmation (passage à l’échelle, intégration, multisectorialité, approches  systémiques) ;  
§  Renforcement du lien « humanitaire-développement-paix »  dans la programmation (Triple Nexus) ;  
§  Monitorage renforcé des résultats des  interventions (suivi en temps réel, systèmes nationaux d’information sectoriels) ;
§  Mobilisation du pouvoir des entreprises en  faveur des enfants (mobilisation du secteur privé) ;  
§  Evaluation de l’Initiative Communes de  Convergence (leçons apprises, passage à l’échelle) ; 
§  Préparation et Réponse aux urgences (COVID-19,  Epidémies Récurrentes, Pays côtiers Sahel).

WCAR,Guinea Bissau,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"To address the persistent lack of data  on children and counter the challenges posed by COVID-19 restrictions, the  process of finalization and validation of the MICS survey results was carried  out remotely, a first for the region. Technical workshops were organized  between the UNICEF West and Central Africa Regional office, the CO and the  National Institute of Statistics (INE) in order to process and analyse the  data, to finalize and technically validate the report. To enable the national  counterpart to be fully involved at every step, UNICEF invested in internet  features and technology access for INE staff. This tripartite collaboration  demonstrated how important it is to invest in the digital connectivity of the  partners, especially during an emergency.
  
Taking advantage of the  increased use of social media and online solutions, UNICEF, together with  other UN agencies and national partners, supported the “Bioksan site”, the first  online platform intended to strengthen the prevention of violence against  girls and women during the COVID-19 pandemic. The platform, which was  launched in May, is run by a group of CSOs that focus on GBV prevention and  services provision and management of reported cases. To make it attractive  for young people, the platform is accessible through social media and features  local artists, girls and women’s rights activists. In addition, 9 videos  spots broadcasted through the national TV and social media were developed to  promote the platform. Since its launch, the platform has been accessed 2,450  times and 32 cases of GBV complaints have been made through the site. "
WCAR,Liberia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked further havoc across Liberia’s fragile social sectors. The pandemic exposed vulnerabilities across the health sector, highlighted poor access to water and sanitation, and exacerbated sexual and gender-based violence, especially for girls.
Beyond health, the secondary impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was felt the most in the education sector especially in schools, which serve as multisectoral service platforms. Despite lessons learned from the prolonged period of school closures during the Ebola epidemic, poor preparedness exacerbated the already precarious issue of poor access to education. The population of out of school children (estimated at 50 per cent) was pushed over the limit by the addition of school children who are not attending school. Despite national guidance to support the full reopening of schools in December 2020, it is estimated that that only 35 per cent of schools are operating at full capacity. There is no clear indication if pre Covid-19 attendance levels will be achieved.
While the pandemic provided an opportunity to scale up innovative learning mechanisms including remote and e-learning, there is an urgent need to measure both the full impact of educational loss due to the pandemic and to reimagine all the new learning requirements. Learning innovations, including distance and e-learning, are now in great demand and have been rolled out. However, these innovations need to be mainstreamed and there is need for clear feedback mechanisms that assess effectiveness and attainment of learning goals.  
Going forward, a number of innovative measures have emerged that will need consolidation and scaling up. The need to reimagine schools or learning centres as multi-service platforms has also emerged as a priority approach for the future. At schools, children will be able to access health kits and psychosocial support to address the multiplicity of needs, which go beyond learning and schooling, among impacted children. Apart from providing holistic services, such schools also address protection and equity issues.
The U-Report platform was used as a feedback mechanism tool to determine the reach of mass messaging on handwashing with soap. This helped gather information on hand hygiene practices in hard-to-reach areas. UNICEF will incorporate this innovative approach in regular WASH programming, as part of the humanitarian and development nexus.
The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the critical need for UNICEF to be able to remotely monitor programme deliverables by building a programme monitoring system with virtual access, whereby real-time remote observation and tracking of activities is possible. GPS based mobile technology through Geographical Tagging (Geotagging) is being used and is based on location-specific information, called EXIF (Exchangeable Image File) data. Geotagging collects programme related information using pictures, videos and even SMS messages and consequently tracks progress. This innovative monitoring tool is already being used in the education section to monitor and report on education interventions in the context of COVID-19. This work is being led by the Programme Monitoring and Evaluation section and has been incorporated in all new Programme Cooperation Agreements and Programme Documents. In 2020, nine Implementing Partners received training on how to properly capture, store and share the geotagged media of programme activities as part of programme implementation. The aim for 2021 is for all programmes to incorporate this into their monitoring and evaluation practices, requiring all Civil Society Organizations to undergo training on geotagging. This initiative addresses the challenge of access to remote areas in Liberia, due to poor road conditions, which remains a pervasive challenge to achieving results for children. Geotagging enables programmes to validate, monitor and evaluate progress on the ground in real-time without having to travel to hard-to-reach locations, saving manpower, resources, time and effort."
WCAR,Mali,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The strategic and programmatic decision to use a life cycle approach in the country program 2020-2024 was primarily based on a review of the previous program, which had highlighted vertical, compartmentalized, poorly coordinated and piecemeal interventions that couldn’t achieve sustainable outcomes for children. The life-cycle approach places the child at the heart of programming, making it possible to cover the full spectrum of rights and to deploy the organization’s comparative advantages, but also to build strategic and operational partnerships for greater collaboration.
Specific pillars and outcomes of the life-cycle approach:
Early years 0–5 years: Young girls and boys, particularly the most disadvantaged/ deprived and hard-to-reach, will be immunized, well nourished, healthy (treated against common illnesses), protected, registered at birth, and prepared for school, including in humanitarian situations
The formative years 6-12 years: The most-deprived and hard-to-reach children aged 6 to 12 years have increased access to gender responsive and integrated quality basic social services in a protective, safe and clean environment, including in humanitarian situations.
The second decade: Adolescent girls and boys aged 13 to 18 years are increasingly empowered and able to access social services adapted to their needs and effectively participate in socioeconomic decision-making, including in humanitarian situations.
These three components of the cycle are backed-up by two additional cross-cutting enabling results so that: (i) Girls and boys live in more inclusive and resilient communities strengthened by an enabling environment and systems that create equitable chances in life and (ii) The country program is effectively designed, coordinated, managed and supported to meet quality programming standards in achieving results for children.
The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures imposed to mitigate its impact proved to be major obstacles to a full deployment of the life-cycle approach from the very start of the new country program. However, UNICEF was able to adapt and turn these obstacles into an opportunity for enhanced collaboration both internally and externally. This included the use of technology to conduct virtual meetings for program coordination and monitoring. 
Adoption of the life cycle approach has created a dynamic that has facilitated bringing together the different government ministries and partners to collaborate, cooperate and coordinate their actions at central and local level. External factors have also played a role. For example, the government has set up a Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, which will facilitate addressing health issues holistically from a curative, preventive and promotional point of view, and in concert with social protection, child protection, early stimulation and learning issues, including resilience to shocks. The selection of implementing partners, particularly NGOs, and the preparation of program documents underpinning cooperation are increasingly integrated. Traditionally vertical sectors are now coming together to define, in a consensual manner, areas of convergent intervention at both programmatic and geographic levels. This dynamic will eventually result in an integrated monitoring and evaluation of interventions by central and local level departments. This should further strengthen the leadership and ownership of the program by the national counterpart. UNICEF is also bringing the life cycle approach to inter-agency dialogue. This will result in a more holistic country assessment for the future UNSDCF. Intermediate analytical works and household surveys will also be used to produce additional analysis based on the three components of the life cycle.  Operational and strategic partnership will then follow to holistically address children rights.
Although there are positive signals, the life-cycle approach still poses significant challenges. For example, the program entered its operational phase while the national programming framework document was already in force. This framework document does not employ a life-cycle approach, creating challenges for reporting. Agreement on a common set of indicators for each life-cycle pillar managed within a strong information management system will be critical. Internally, some of the funding previously allocated to the program was earmarked for specific thematic areas and was not sufficiently flexible to support full deployment of the life-cycle approach. Going forward, UNICEF will develop more integrated funding proposals that embrace the life-cycle approach. 
In 2021 and beyond, the established multi-sectoral coordination mechanisms at national and decentralized levels will not only improve mutualizing efforts and resources, but also reaching more children in need with integrated and complementary interventions and services."
WCAR,Mauritania,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"La convergence géographique des interventions promue par le CPDD 2018-2022 s’étant renforcée, plusieurs opportunités restent à saisir. Il sera nécessaire de renforcer l’intégration entre la nutrition, la santé et la WASH (KRC2/8), mais aussi la prévention des violences (KRC5) dans le programme scolaire (KRC3) afin d’améliorer le contenu et renforcer la résilience des populations. L’accent sur des activités multisectorielles à haut impact à destination de la jeunesse a permis la mise en place d'un centre d'activités pour 1400 adolescentes dans le quartier périurbain de Dar Naïm à Nouakchott, zone de convergence du SNU. Des coachs en développement personnel et en activités ludiques y encadrent les activités et font de cet espace une plateforme innovante de socialisation, de partage d’expériences et d’accès à l’information sur les droits et qui favorise l’émulation et l’autonomisation des filles. Face aux multiples défis auxquels elles sont confrontées, le programme reconnait l’importance de prioriser les interventions en faveur de l’autonomisation de la jeune fille à travers la création de filières porteuses. Si le volet WASH intègre les besoins des adolescentes à risque de déperdition scolaire ou de violences dues à l’absence de latrines/lieux décents pour l‘hygiène menstruelle ou au mauvais emplacement des latrines ; il sera nécessaire d’anticiper la pérennisation des interventions tout comme leur passage à l’échelle.  
 
Dans le cadre du projet résilience-BMZ mis en œuvre conjointement avec le PAM, la participation des équipes de l’UNICEF au travail de planification mené par le PAM au niveau communautaire a révélé le potentiel d’une intégration plus systématique des dimensions relatives à la protection de l’enfant, la vaccination, et l’éducation à la fois à l’approche et aux outils de suivi utilisés. Le développement local ne pouvant se réaliser que s’il y a véritable appropriation de l’analyse de la situation par les communautés concernées et une implication effective de leur part dans les solutions identifiées.
 
Concernant la protection sociale, d’importantes avancées ont été effectuées en 2020, notamment pour le ciblage des bénéficiaires des programmes de filets sociaux et la réduction des coûts opérationnels particulièrement notables dans ce vaste pays à faible densité démographique. Cependant, des défis persistent concernant la coordination institutionnelle des acteurs de la protection sociale et demandent que le dialogue puisse être renforcé, notamment à travers la définition d’une nouvelle stratégie nationale. Le contexte offre une opportunité pour articuler les interventions, rendre les programmes de protection sociale davantage réactifs aux chocs et inclure de manière systématique les vulnérabilités, notamment celles en lien avec les enfants, dans les processus de ciblage. 
 
Dans le cadre de la réponse à la pandémie de COVID-19 dans le pays, la mobilisation des efforts devant les défis multiples liés à la continuité des services de base et ont donné lieu à des initiatives innovantes, notamment à travers l’éducation à distance, la création d’un centre d’appel et une meilleure utilisation des applications mobiles, des réseaux sociaux et communautaires. Les innovations testées pour assurer une continuité de l’apprentissage ont souligné la nécessité de développer une véritable stratégie de « e-learning » afin d’accélérer l’accès à l’éducation pour tous et réduire la fracture digitale. Avec plus de 1,5 million d’appels de mars à septembre, l’expérience du centre d’appel mis en place par le ministère de la Santé avec l’appui de l’UNICEF dans le cadre de la réponse à la COVID-19, souligne le potentiel de ce type de services à la fois pour mobiliser et informer le public, mais aussi pour générer des alertes et orienter la réponse opérationnelle des services de santé. La poursuite de l’appui technique devrait permettre en 2021 de pérenniser cette expérience à travers le renforcement, la systématisation et potentiellement le regroupement de services existants pour des résultats accrus en termes de santé publique (centre d’appel COVID, sécurité routière, SAMU et suivi des urgences obstétricales). 
 
Les nouveaux plans sectoriels 2021-2030 (éducation, santé) et stratégies nationales (jeunesse, protection sociale) seront autant d’opportunités pour articuler une vision renouvelée vers un rééquilibrage de l’offre de services afin que ceux-ci puissent être complets, inclusifs et adaptés aux réalités mauritaniennes. Le plaidoyer encourageant les efforts entamés pour recruter un personnel qualifié et renforcer les capacités des directions régionales en gestion des moyens humains et matériels sera poursuivi afin que ces services puissent jouer efficacement leur rôle, prérequis central pour l’atteinte et la pérennité des résultats des secteurs sociaux. Dans le domaine PF4C, des efforts seront également fournis pour appuyer la préparation du pays à la sortie de l’éligibilité au financement extérieur (dons à prêts de la BM, une fois l’arrivée des recettes gazières à partir de 2022 ; GAVI à partir de 2025 etc.).
 
Devant le nombre d’enfants hors de l’école (KRC3), il sera nécessaire d’accélérer la création de passerelles vers la formation professionnelle pour les enfants bénéficiant de l’enseignement originel à travers le renforcement du dialogue avec les différents ministères impliqués. Parallèlement au plaidoyer pour les réformes législatives en matière de VBG (KRC5), des formations en faveur des magistrats seront organisées afin de contribuer à l’obtention d’une juste réparation pour les victimes et ainsi à mettre fin à l’impunité des auteurs de violences. 
 
L’accompagnement dans l’élaboration du dossier d’investissement GFF pour l’amélioration de la santé de la mère, du nouveau-né, de l’enfant et de l’adolescent y compris l’enregistrement des naissances se poursuivra en 2021. Les questions de la qualité de l’eau, de la coordination sectorielle fonctionnelle, du financement du secteur et de l’actualisation des stratégies sectorielles pour intégrer les questions de résilience et de changement climatique, en cohérence avec les ODD et la SCAPP, sont autant de chantiers qui ont été ralentis et qui seront reconduits en 2021 dans la planification avec le Gouvernement. 
 
Enfin, tout en poursuivant réponse COVID-19 ainsi que la préparation au COVAX, le Bureau entamera un exercice SMR (en intégrant des analyses genre, impact environnemental et risques) qui permettra de faire un bilan des réalisations et de tirer les leçons relatives à la mise en œuvre du programme pays (2018-2022) afin de développer les jalons du prochain programme pays (2023-2027) et alimenter la préparation de l’UNDAF. 

"
WCAR,Niger,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated vulnerabilities and highlighted gaps in national systems, thus confirming the relevance of the ongoing transition to a systems-strengthening approach for the Niger-UNICEF programme. The pandemic also presented opportunities for innovation, as well as strengthening of existing approaches to include response measures.  
 
Programme adaptation and anchoring policy response and implementation in local government and community systems was key to ensuring continuity of essential services delivery. 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the fragility of Niger’s health system. With health services expected to increase the capacity of their laboratories, the GeneXpert coverage plan, designed with technical support from UNICEF for TB and HIV diagnosis, helped solve the COVID-19 diagnostic problem by decentralizing testing, making the health care system more resilient. Delays in vaccine procurement was another major challenge, and UNICEF’s support to strengthening the logistic information and management system proved instrumental to improving immunization supply chain capacity and ultimately increasing routine immunization coverage. For nutrition interventions, the pandemic offered the opportunity to innovate by adopting selected features of the simplified protocols for management of severe wasting; by strengthening routine VAS through immunization platforms; and by enhancing cross-sectoral programming with the WASH sector. COVID-19 fostered a greater awareness regarding innovation in Education, hence UNICEF initiated a dialogue with the Government around Giga support in Niger to scale up school connectivity. At the same time, UNICEF started policy dialogue regarding distance learning as an opportunity for out-of-school youth to gain marketable skills.   
 
Access was a major obstacle for development and humanitarian programming in 2020 due to movement restrictions resulting from COVID-19 mitigation measures, as well as the movement restrictions imposed by national authorities due to deteriorating security situation. The prohibition of gatherings and severe restrictions on field missions resulted in a new way of working based on ICT, but also an enhancement of partnership arrangements with implementing partners and third-party monitoring. UNICEF worked closely with the Humanitarian Country Team to formulate the humanitarian access strategy, but given the extremely challenging context this will remain a priority for 2021. To maintain strong donor relations, UNICEF pioneered “virtual field visits” as a new advocacy tool.  UNICEF also innovated in its engagement with youth and communities as exemplified by the global “Coping with COVID-19"" initiative, whereby adolescent girls were provided a virtual platform to express their points of view on matters that affect their future.  
The implementation of innovative cross-sectoral approaches was key to achieving results in 2020 and building resilience, including for COVID-19 response.  
Innovation was spearheaded around a participatory design approach, convening key stakeholders around common agendas using inclusive and participatory mechanisms to empower youth and women to action, facilitating mutual accountability and shared responsibility frameworks around local development goals. This was exemplified through the participatory research on the social demand for education, and during the design workshop on participatory local governance and social accountability with pilot municipalities.  At community level, UNICEF supported the creation of over 12,000 community surveillance committees for social behavior change, community surveillance of COVID-19 alerts and infection prevention, linking with local and regional health authorities. Building on this experience, a sustainable Community Engagement Model was developed and will be implemented starting in 2021 at the heart of resilience-building efforts, to ensure the link between municipal authorities, communities and the populations.  
Important lessons learned were documented beyond COVID-19 adaptations and innovations, particularly in the domain of wasting, data quality, and child protection. The evaluation of the community-based management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) programme in Niger confirmed the possibility to scale up services for wasting treatment through the national health system while maintaining quality services. Despite nearly 100% of health facilities offering CMAM services, case coverage remained low (<50%), highlighting the need for further decentralize the CMAM programme and continued advocacy on prevention. Existing weaknesses in data quality, including monitoring and coordination mechanisms, were apparent in the significant shortfalls of socioeconomic data to monitor progress towards national goals, as well as the lack of timely and reliable humanitarian data.  RapidPro was highlighted, as also indicated by the evaluation of the Diffa pilot, as an invaluable tool for UNICEF and the Government to support data gathering for humanitarian assistance to children in hard-to-reach areas, specifically during COVID-19 and rising insecurity.  
In child protection, encouraging results of the pilot project on collaboration between justice, protection and education actors to support children in contact with the law demonstrated a need for synergy and opened the discussion for a comprehensive national child protection policy. In addition, involving communities in the care of these children brought them closer to the judicial world and improved understanding and acceptance for access to justice for children.  
Based on the progress and lessons learned in 2020, in the final year of the Niger-UNICEF country programme (2019-2021), UNICEF will focus its attention on holistic, resilience-focused humanitarian and development programming integrating COVID-19 response, including the effort to make COVID-19 immunization a reality in Niger. This includes promoting the accountability and performance of basic social services through support to decentralization; enhancing participation and ownership through holistic community-based approaches; and promoting adolescents and young people as actors of change for the development of Niger. UNICEF will further strengthen its approach to resilience by improving evidence building on cross-sectoral approaches, integrating a risk-based approach, and will consolidate investment in the scaling up of the social safety net started in the COVID-19 context. Enhanced partnerships with IFIs for upstream advocacy on priority spending in social sectors, including a strong focus on wasting prevention, will be prioritized. UNICEF will continue to accelerate implementation of innovative approaches for multisectoral approaches to enhance quality of education, connectivity and skills training, as well as specific multi-sectoral and evidence-based approaches for out-of-school adolescent girls. Implementation of the private sector engagement strategy developed in 2020 will be key to broaden the pool of partners, advocate for child rights, gain allies and access innovations. 
 
 

"
WCAR,Nigeria,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The lessons learned in 2020 can be focused in a few key areas: what was learned when in the response to COVID, the importance of building the evidence base for children’s issues, and the need to secure political commitments. 
COVID response and proofing
In immunization, COVID-19 severely disrupted planned immunization activities, multiple Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) were either postponed or outrightly cancelled. Lockdowns, stigma and movement restrictions adversely affected uptake of services at health facilities and multiple cVDPV2 outbreaks were reported putting strain on population immunity. After the initial adjustments, the programme swiftly mobilized the VCM network, conducted multiple cascading workshop to sensitize them on COVID-19 risks and mitigations and integrated COVID-19 messaging with their routine activities. As lessons learnt, UNICEF mobilized the VCM network immediately after the restrictions were lifted and integrated COVID-19 related messages with their routine activities to raise caregiver awareness on COVID-19 risks and mitigation efforts.
The COVID-19 pandemic provided valuable lessons for the nutrition programme. The restrictions brought about the closure of nutrition services. However, the use of existing platforms such as immunization and other critical services led to increased coverage similar to a pre-COVID-19 period. For instance, integrating nutrition services to seasonal malaria activities led to the achievement of 100 per cent coverage of Vitamin A, despite the overall national coverage of 26 per cent. In 2021 and beyond, the programme will strengthen this approach of integrating nutrition services with the health system. UNICEF will also continue to explore the use of virtual meetings and training on nutrition interventions to save cost.  We saw the shift in delivering adolescent nutrition services from schools to communities when the lockdown began, and the use of adolescent peer-to-peer approach as an innovation. The nutrition programme will expand on this approach in the coming year to reach more out of school adolescents with nutrition services. 
Timely strategic COVID-19 emergency preparedness response plan for education at federal and state levels, coordination with strategic partners such as radio and television broadcasters, adaptation and development of learning materials led to the successful implementation of home-based learning. 
• Greater coordination between federal and state governments and other stakeholders and hands-on technical support in data validation and management helped harmonize the EMIS (Education, Management and Information Systems) tool and timely availability of data and expanding the coverage of schools. This leads to better inter and intra states comparision and reporting of data . 
•  support to evidence-based advocacy on gender-responsive enrolment drive, development of national enrollment drive framework and its subsequent operationalisation in  all LGEAs within the federal and state governments  led to on-time enrollment and girls participation and transition to high grades. 
• Children in humanitarian situations need to have timely and sustained access to quality learning with foundational skills. Hence, radio and reading hubs, the adaptation of Teaching at Right Level materials to engage children in learning during the Covid-19 pandemic are some of the commendable examples. The hybrid community learnings centres in North-East Nigeria were innovative strategies used in the reporting year. These community learning hubs are supported with radio, reading and take-home learning and assessment materials to engage children in learning. Also, while schools were closed during the COVID-19 pandemic, the U-Report digital platform (online and offline mode) was utilised for remote learning assessment to understand the learning level of children.
 
Building the evidence base
Continued investment in the multiple indicator cluster survey (MICS) will provide a crucial view of the situation of women and children in 2021. The survey, initially planned for 2020, will be the first large-scale in-person household survey giving evidence on immunization and other key results for children. 
The Intervention Profiling tool developed by UNICEF presents an innovative and powerful decision support tool providing policymakers and WASH practitioners the opportunity to objectively allocate resources and estimate cost of interventions using broader key performance indicators to assess the actual level of needs of states. By utilizing indicators such as security, poverty, gender/equity, etc., the Intervention Profiling tool identifies and targets those most in need of WASH services to ensure that no one is left behind. With constant advocacy and strategic dissemination tactics, the Intervention Profiling tool could be utilized by all stakeholders within the WASH sector. 
 
Political commitment and advocacy
Securing highest-level political commitment to the Clean Nigeria campaign catalyzed a sub-national movement and momentum. It resulted in states leveraging internal resources to replicate the UNICEF model by developing state-wide ODF roadmaps and launching campaigns to end open defecation. By aligning the ODF Campaign with institutional mandates, Osun, Cross River, Ondo and Ekiti states declared a state of emergency for WASH while, Bauchi, Katsina, Nasarawa, Plateau, Ebonyi, Kebbi and Kwara states were able to increase investments in sanitation. 
A major lesson learned in this reporting year is that high level advocacy to the executive and administrative arms of government must be consistent. For instance, a robust planning tool-- Education Sector Performance Assessment Tool (ESPAT) developed in collaboration with UBEC which will become a self-assessment tool for states on the holistic coverage, implementation and compliance with sector plans.
"
WCAR,Republic of Cameroon,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"1.1.  Lessons learned
Implementation of barrier measure went through two major phases. The first one till July 2020 marked by general compliance with handwashing, facemasks wearing and physical distancing. This was probably linked to fatality rate. The second phase marked by the reduction of contamination and death toll led to abandonment of barrier measures noticed in public places. This is probably due to lack of alignment of communication strategy with key socioeconomic drivers as well as rumors about the fact some officials may insist on the existence of COVID-19 due to the profit they could get from funds provided by external donors.
With regard to COVID-19, UNICEF’s contribution has been facilitated by the presence of field offices, the physical presence of emergency management teams in all offices and a continuous involvement of UNICEF colleagues working remotely, diversity of existing partnerships with CSOs and community-based organizations in place and capacity of partners to deliver a minimum package of basic inputs. The fact that most of funds received were tagged did not allow the flexibility required by the response as needs of the response plan are varied.
With 1,000,000 internally displaced population with hard to reach communities and partners’ limited capacity to implement quality humanitarian response, and the fact that the country is not yet donor attractive, hampers effectiveness and efficacy of humanitarian response.
In nutrition sector, diversification of platforms (inter-ministerial committee to fight malnutrition (CILM), the support to the implementation and follow-up of Communes networks on Nutrition, involvement in the nomination and follow-up of Nutrition Ambassadors, Civil Society, Academia, UN agencies, parliamentarian network) on advocacy at national and local levels is an enabling factor for a better positioning of nutrition issues in development plans. It also facilitates resources mobilization in the sector. engagement has enabled Improvement of global Governance and visibility in the Nutrition sector.
Communication has emerged as one of the major bottlenecks to immunization. The high negative impact of rumors on demand and use of immunization services kept growing. Rethinking structured and integrated communication approaches is critical for the increment of immunization coverages. New alternative strategies are imperative.
UNICEF seized the opportunity of existing community-based child protection networks to encourage communities to develop their own birth registration community-led mechanism. To date, this initiative is proving to be an ideal cost-effective solution to an improved geographical coverage. These mechanisms are also conducive for awareness raising on birth registration, identification of new births in communities, information of civil registrars and referral of families to civil registration offices. Results should be capitalized upon in 2021 to increase the scope and birth registration rate.
Mindful of the scope of needs of humanitarian assistance in Cameroon, Country Office developed a Standard Operating Procedure to address specific operation issues connected to COVID-19 response in crisis affected regions. This SOP was intended to accelerate procedures for signature of Humanitarian Programme Documents within 48 hours. Since COVID-19 response involves considerable purchase of goods and other commodities in a context where local industries are weak, the implementation of this SOP was challenged by the absence of standard costs for goods, commodities and services. Country Office is working to develop a standardized price reference for goods and services to be allowed for procurement at local markets using partners procedures. This will also facilitate budgetary analysis. 
1.2.  Emerging opportunities
In December 2020, the Country held regional elections therefore completing the establishment of institutions created by the law governing decentralization. Regional and Divisional councils are new actors with whom UNICEF will partners to accelerate improvement of the rights of the child. Roles and responsibilities assigned by the law to these institutions open ways for better and customized solutions to child related development issues. 
Government authorities are striving to operationalize the Universal Health Coverage in the nearest future. This constitutes a significant opportunity to remove major bottlenecks that have been hampering progress. Universal Coverage is an ideal solution to strengthen governance and accountability mechanisms as well as increase access of the most vulnerable to health services. This will contribute serve the most vulnerable in line with the “leave no-one behind” principle. Universal Health Coverage will also improve quality of care and services.
1.3.  Innovations
Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF)… From image boxes to animated videos. To improve both quality and coverage of IYCF communication and increased knowledge and good practices in communities, UNICEF supported the Cameroonian startup CAYITSI  to develop new attractive communication materials with the creation of 12 animated, digital, dynamic videos to be used both in the health care facilities (Primary targets are the antenatal care sessions) and in the communities during awareness sessions. Videos are hosting in the mobile application for presentation and entertaining access and have been translated in 04 languages (French, English, Foufouldé and Maka).
Connect My School is a multipurpose concept designed to improve children’s learning accomplishment, reduction of numeric gap in favor of poorest remote rural and urban communities, school governance, accountability and transfer of competences to local councils. 
Mindful of limited access to electricity and Internet in targeted areas, the initiative opted for a hub approach, the implementation strategy is anchored on the following major pillars:
·       Capacity strengthening of school’s stakeholder (students, teachers, headmasters, inspectors) and schools governance structures
·       Capacity development of regional education authorities and teacher training institutions

WCAR,Sao Tome & Principe,Lessons Learned and Innovations," The pandemic was undoubtedly rich in lessons learned for UNICEF as well as for the United Nations System as a whole. The disruption of service delivery for a prolonged time, showed the fragility of the systems in place and the vulnerability of the country due to its isolation from the rest of the continent. The country has never been exposed to large scale emergency and all actors needed to join forces in record time to develop a preparedness and response plan which could anticipate the impact of COVID19 at a time when such impact was unknown at global level. One of the biggest challenged consisted in anticipating the consequences of the pandemic on sectors other than the health sector. For example, it was not possible to anticipate the rise of violence against children connected with the lockdown measure.

 The main lesson learned is therefore the need to mainstream emergency preparedness into regular planning exercises both internally and with national partners. 

The abrupt school closure requested UNICEF and partners to develop an alternative learning plan very quickly in order to reduce loss of learning opportunities by children and young people at all levels. The experience showed that alternatively learning options should not be limited to emergency situations but should be strengthened and provided as a complementary education offer which could benefit children out of school for reasons other than the pandemic. Surely, the  pandemic created the opportunity to start a national dialogue around alternative service provision, mainly those based on virtual and technological platforms. It also unmasked the digital divide which affects Sao Tome and Principe and which should be object of a wider conversation including private sector, telecommunication companies, the government and development actors.  
 
 In the area of health, the disruption of vaccines provision was a clear example of the need to advocate for regional vaccines hubs to reduce both costs and procurement transactions as well as the risks of stock-out. The country's cold chain is not yet equipped with large  stocking capacities and therefore it will not be possible to procure large amount of vaccines to ensure preparedness in case of needed.
 
  The collaboration with UN agencies and the establishment of the Humanitarian Corridor greatly helped in containing the negative impact of the border closure. Considering the volatily of the global situation and the peculiar vulnerability of STP, it might be necessary to advocate for the reactivation of the humanitarian corridor for ad hoc support to humanitarian and development operations.
 
 The flexible arrangements promoted by the organization both for staff wellbeing and funds reprogramming allowed UNICEF to be more agile in support to the pandemic response and to adjust its interventions accordingly. It was also encouraging to see partners and donors availability to discuss and reorient agreements to face the programmatic priorities posed by COVID19. The exchange of knowledge and learning with other countries, especially with lusophone countries, proved to be critical for the country office as well as national partners to learn real time on the best approaches to explore especially with regards to education, RCCE and C4D approaches in general.  
 
 Beyond COVID19, MICS6 process also brought a great deal of lessons learned linked to ownership building and partners coordination and it also confirmed the urgent need to leverage support for real time data generation to monitor the situation of children, women and other vulnerable groups.UNICEF will engage nto a more comprehensive VAC study to analyze causes of the rise of violence, now that quantitative trends are available.
   
 MICS6 data in the area of adolescent knowledge and practices confirm the need to integrate stronger monitoring component in the delivery of the life skills programme and to adjust the content of the programme accordingly to make sure results in the area of HIV/AIDS prevention and reduction of alcohol abuse are achieved.

Additionally, MICS6 data confirmed the need for UNICEF to join forces with the World Bank and other partners and align with KRC4. Considering the important achievements made in the reduction of out of school children, a programmatic refocus in support to quality learning outcomes  and retention in upper secondary education, is now essential. 

The launch of the internship programme in support to social services can be considered an innovation. The initiative has the double benefit of palliating the lack of human resources among the social workforce and to provide valuable professional experience to young boys and girls as they look for job opportunities.
 
 The coming year 2021 will be critical to further analyse MICS6 data, develop a comprehensive and forward-looking situation analysis (SITAN) and engage in the development of the new Cooperation Framework as well as the new Country Programme which will start in 2023. The extension of the current country programme will be an opportunity to catch up on programmatic priorities which were delayed by COVID19 but also to collect additional qualitative information to inform nationa priorities.

Finally, in 2021 the country will organize its Presidential Elections. UNICEF in collaboration with the UN System will advocate for a peaceful process, and for a cohesive vision towards the reduction of inequities and promotion of children's rights.

WCAR,Senegal,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"§  Capitalizing on a rare national consensus in child protection: The dire and protracted situation of street children and children in some Quranic schools became a national emergency due to the spread of COVID-19. UNICEF conducted strategic advocacy, provided technical guidance on implementation of national commitments, supported social mobilization and new initiatives implemented by many child protection stakeholders. The high demand for social change at local level, combined with the government’s political willingness to move from policy to action, provided an unprecedented opportunity to secure more sustainable changes in the future. In 2021, UNICEF aims to transform this momentum into legislative reform, law enforcement, alternative education for out-of-school children, as well as increased access to social protection schemes for child victims of violence and neglect.
 
§  Opportunities to ‘reimagine education’: The deployment of distance and digital learning, a substantial innovation in Senegal, offered government and education sector partners a unique opportunity to ‘reimagine education’ and explore the development of new modalities to extend alternative education and accelerate results for out-of-school children and adolescents. The development of joint partnerships with local governments and decentralized education authorities, through UNICEF programming, is helping address teacher shortages and avoid school closures in underprivileged localities. Such opportunities will be scaled up in 2021.
 
§  Leveraging UNICEF’s credibility for a stronger COVID-19 response: Learning from the previous Ebola crisis, Senegal was quick to develop a successful and effective framework of actions for the COVID-19 response. Based on its strong, long-term relationship with the government, UNICEF was able to position itself and influence the work and decisions of the national commissions (emergency coordination, case management, RCCE, logistics, IPC) and lead the collaborative work with UN agencies and other development partners – in particular in the areas of education, child protection and social protection. While nationally established coordination mechanisms were instrumental in containing the first wave of COVID-19, decentralized structures and community-based interventions should be prioritized in the second wave’s response. 
 
§  Direct budget support can be directed to the most vulnerable: The majority of Senegal’s development partners prefer to channel official development assistance and humanitarian aid through direct budget support. UNICEF therefore sharpened its dialogue with partners to leverage this funding modality. Early results showed how strong partnerships and proactive advocacy from UNICEF’s side helped shape the financing priorities of major development partners. UNICEF will further advocate for the use of direct budget support and prioritized interventions to support the most vulnerable children in Senegal.
 
§  Unleashing the vast potential of Senegal’s youth: Over the last year, about 7500 volunteers, including adolescents and young people, were mobilised to support COVID-19 prevention and response actions with UNICEF support. As volunteers were able to put in place solutions beyond the COVID-19 response, notably in the areas of environmental protection and nutrition, this remarkable level of participation underlines the potential of youth to drive and accelerate positive change at regional, departmental and community levels. To crystalize the strategy, UNICEF Senegal entered into formal partnerships with several youth-led and youth-focused NGOs. UNICEF will also develop a strategic note and theory of change on youth programming and participation as part of its 2021 mid-term review.
 
INNOVATIONS
 
§  Prevention and treatment of Pneumonia results in COVID-19 treatment gains. UNICEF’s SPRINT initiative was launched in-country prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. SPRINT improved the availability of life-saving antibiotics and oxygen therapies at decentralised level, informing contractual decisions with oxygen suppliers and helping other country offices in setting implementation plans and timelines. As COVID-19 causes pneumonia, these pre-pandemic efforts directly contributed to a rapid emergency response with UNICEF support. As a ‘first-of-its-kind’ project, SPRINT influenced how UNICEF supported the larger global COVID-19 oxygen response and positioned the Government of Senegal to showcase best practices at regional and even global levels.
 
§  Innovations are rarely successful without systems strengthening: The Rapid Pro platform, used to alert and report on child protection for access to services and real-time monitoring, revealed a decrease of reported cases in the first months of the pandemic, enabling local actors to take corrective measures. The planned deployment of Rapid Pro to other regions will increase access of protective services to child victims of violence. Additional investments will be prioritized to institutionalize the tool at national level, as well as invest in the technical capacity building of case workers and strengthening of the coordinated case management system. These interventions will strengthen a quality and timely response to increasing child protection demands. 
 
§  Joint United Nations House. To optimize operational efficiencies within the joint United Nations House structure, UNICEF was selected to host an Independent Project Unit that will provide common services to all UN organisations in-country. For the first time ever, UNICEF will host such a unit for all UN Agencies, relying on its contractual arrangements and internal control frameworks. UNICEF will provide transactional back-office capacity, corresponding policies and procedures as well as administrative support for HR, Supply/Procurement and IT services. UNICEF is currently working closely with the other 33 UN agencies in Senegal to prepare for the move to the UN House in the coming 18 months.
 
§  ‘Emotional wardens’ for staff well-being: Together with the Western and Central Regional Office based in Dakar, the UNICEF Senegal Country Office adapted its Business Continuity Plan, developed strong protocols to maintain work at office-level and successfully influenced UN system procedures for business continuity and support to staff impacted by COVID-19. An internal ‘emotional wardens system’ was established to provide peer support to every staff member and was hailed as a great initiative and success by keeping staff morale high during the crisis. With the 2020 Global Staff Survey showing substantial improvements on all surveyed dimensions compared to 2017, efforts will aim to reach even higher levels of staff satisfaction in 2021, focusing on career development, work-life balance and diversity.
 
The above encapsulates how programmes can be adapted, scaled-up or re-envisioned in 2021 and beyond. The 2021 mid-term review of the country programme will further discuss lessons learnt to make necessary programme adjustments.
 

"
WCAR,Sierra Leone,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"At a cross-cutting level, while the supply function was essential to the sectoral responses, challenges like shipping delays due to COVID-19-related border closures and attendant restrictions imposed by countries worldwide adversely affected the timely delivery of orders.   As a result, in 2021, it will be important for UNICEF to factor in more time into project implementation plans to avoid delays and there is a need to request extension on grant expiry dates. Other key areas from which the office is distilling lessons learned based on its work in 2020 are as follows:
 
Humanitarian response: humanitarian-development nexus
There is a need to strengthen the humanitarian-development nexus beyond the level achieved based on lessons learned from and implemented based on experiences from the Ebola epidemic. While, based on the Ebola experience,  COVID-19 response proved to be more effective and timely because it started off with response mechanisms through the Public Health Emergency Operation Center (PHEOC) pillars in programming implementation, it is clear that resilience needs to be more strongly built into the response through disaster risk reduction planning and preparedness.   The continued challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic and the emergence of a polio outbreak at the end of 2020, provide opportunities for the country office to undertake a thorough review of its current Emergency Preparedness and Response plans including a risk-analysis as an entry point for  strengthening risk-informed programming in the Sierra Leone context and to support the government in reinforcing its capacity.
 
Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE)
COVID-19 has further established Risk Commination and Community Engagement (RCCE) as an important cornerstone in emergency response and has provided continued opportunities to learn and improve its use. At the onset of the crisis, COVID-19 risk communication efforts focused almost exclusively on symptoms and prevention measures, while equally important messages to promote continued use of essential health and nutrition services and family practices were overlooked. Though this was corrected, the takeaway, as noted with other sector interventions, is to ensure a comprehensive and integrated approach (covering both humanitarian and development angles) of communication and social mobilization at the start of emergencies. Integration can result in efficiency and low-cost gains, as evidenced in the Long-Lasting Insecticide treated Nets (LLIN) campaign’s social mobilisation activities which promoted both LLIN use and adoption of COVID-19 safety measures.
 
Influencers
Engaging with local influencers has been a new and effective way of working for the country office. UNICEF collaborated with four footballers and three musicians, who through social media pages, national television and billboards, shared information to bring awareness and sensitisation on how to prevent COVID-19. The collaboration with the Sierra Leone Football Association (SLFA) was built from the successful lessons learned when the SFLA partnered with UNICEF on communications and media engagements (films, photos, radio discussions) during the Ebola outbreak. It was noted that collaborating with institutions like the SLFA on awareness raising of a healthy lifestyle during health pandemics can be a very effective way of reaching a broader public. In 2021 UNICEF plans to continue developing standing relationships with influencers so that they begin to disseminate health and development messages from their own volition.
 
Innovation
UNICEF Sierra Leone continues to foster innovation and technology to accelerate results for children as a support tool for programmatic interventions and strategically at a system-wide level. In this regard, UNICEF works with the Government’s Directorate of Science, Technology and Innovation. 
 
In July 2020, Sierra Leone joined Project Giga, a UNICEF and International Telecommunication Union (ITU) joint initiative to connect every school to the internet, giving young people access to information. A roadmap has been agreed on with UNICEF providing technical assistance in advance of activities in 2021.
 
UNICEF is part of the Generation Unlimited initiative, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions, implementation in 2020 was delayed. UPSHIFT was equally negatively affected. UNICEF started to adapt and redesign the implementation strategies to a hybrid of in-person, remote and digital spaces, for example for the Reimagine Education global initiative to catalyse and scale up the approach. A lesson learned is to always have alternative implementation strategies as part of the overall project plan. 
 
In 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic focus turned to remote communication and engagement approaches, with high expectations for mobile technology. A heavy reliance on U-Report, for awareness and programme monitoring, showed the limits of U-Reporters in engaging with repetitious content. There is an opportunity to further define U-Report's strategic objectives and direction, particularly in relation to adolescent engagement. Piloting U-Report for rapid reporting in the RCSM pillar was challenging and more tools other than SMS are necessary to support real-time information sharing. There are also opportunities to support the Grievance Redress Mechanism using U-Report's underlying technology, RapidPro.
 
Going forward UNICEF in Sierra Leone will update and adapt its annual workplan for 2021 with partners, and build on the above lessons learned and innovations through supporting line ministries and implementing partners to review lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic response in 2020 and ensure better integration of sector and cross-sectoral interventions in 2021 and future emergency responses. The country office will close ongoing evaluations in 2021, which will give further insights to how it can continue to enhance programming for children, adolescents and their families in order to leave no one behind.

WCAR,Togo,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Leçons apprises
La pandémie de la COVID-19 a affecté la performance du pays en vaccination, avec une baisse des couvertures vaccinales cumulées inférieures à 90% pour tous les antigènes au niveau national en juin 2020, comparé aux couvertures de 2019 : DTC-HepB-Hib3 90% en 2019 contre 82% en 2020. 
L’analyse des données a montré que les cibles non vaccinées sont celles couvertes par les stratégies avancées. Plusieurs facteurs justifient cette baisse : la persistance des rumeurs anti-vaccination relayées par les réseaux sociaux ; la mobilisation du personnel de santé pour la COVID-19 au détriment d’autres interventions et la baisse de fréquentation des services de santé par peur d’être infectées. 
Le gouvernement et ses partenaires ont décidé de mettre en œuvre une initiative de relance de la vaccination chez les enfants et les femmes enceintes à l’échelle nationale. L’initiative s’est bâtie sur les atouts du pays dans le domaine du PEV et des Journées de Santé de l’Enfant : i) l’identification des villages à faible performance de vaccination suivi de l’élaboration d’un plan d’accélération ; ii) l’existence des COSAN[1] et des COGES[2] pour l’engagement communautaire ;iii) les ASC[3] responsables de l’organisation des activités et de la communication pour la vaccination.
Les résultats de couverture du DTC-HepB-Hib3 de 82% en juin sont passés à 89% en décembre 2020 grâce aux stratégies avancées, au monitorage renforcé et aux supervisions formatives au niveau district au cours du second semestre. 
Cette approche sera poursuivie et renforcée en 2021 en offrant un paquet intégré de services essentiels incluant l’enregistrement des naissances. Le partenariat entre le ministère de la Santé, l’UNICEF, l’OMS, GAVI et l’Université de Lomé permettra de documenter les interventions, de procéder à une analyse holistique en vue de la consolidation et la pérennisation des acquis de cette stratégie nationale dans un contexte complexe et imprévisible.
Le couvre-feu pendant la pandémie a mis en évidence l’invisibilité de la vulnérabilité des enfants vivant en situation de rue. Sous le leadership du ministère de l’Action Sociale, l’UNICEF a soutenu un diagnostic rapide à Lomé dans la nuit en mai 2020 pour évaluer la situation des enfants et populations sans domicile et en situation de rue. Ce diagnostic a été conduit avec Handicap International, l’ONG Halsa international et le FODDET[4].
Les informations collectées ont mis en lumière la précarité de cette population. Environ 2.080 personnes (905 femmes) ont été identifiées par les agents de collecte, dont 38% d’enfants (38% de filles), 17% de jeunes filles mères et 6% de nourrissons. Ces groupes y compris certaines familles n'avaient pas accès aux droits les plus élémentaires, tel que l’accès au logement et un environnement sécurisé pendant la nuit, à une alimentation saine et à l’information, notamment sur la pandémie en cours, aux services de santé, ainsi que le droit d’être protégé contre la violence et l’abus. La majorité des cas de violences déclarés (75%) concernaient les moins de 15 ans (84% de filles). 
Les résultats ont permis de mobiliser les partenaires autour d’un plan d'action comprenant : i) le suivi à travers des rondes nocturnes à Lomé, ii) le soutien matériel et la prise en charge psychosociale ; iii) le référencement des cas de violences au CROPESDI[5] ou aux services de santé. 
Au total, 1.489 enfants vulnérables (260 filles), y compris ceux vivant en situation de rue et d’autres victimes de violence dans les familles, ont bénéficié de l’appui en matériel, d'un soutien psychosocial et d'informations pour mieux se protéger de la pandémie. Cela a conduit à une réorientation des interventions des acteurs du Système de Protection de l’Enfant vers les groupes du milieu urbain et à la conduite des diagnostics dans les principales villes du pays en 2021.
INNOVATION
Le taux d’intérêt pour la construction de latrines est de 14% dans les institutions bancaires. La réalisation de latrines en milieu urbain nécessite l’utilisation des matériaux durables et donc plus de moyen financier qu’en milieu rural, ce dont ne disposent pas les ménages. Les Institutions de Microfinance (IMF) n’offraient pas de crédit à la construction de latrines. 
 
Le plaidoyer de l’UNICEF afin d’alléger le fardeau financier des ménages les plus vulnérables a permis intégration de latrines dans le catalogue des IMF et l’adoption des mécanismes de financement favorisant l’accès des communautés aux crédits pour les produits d’hygiène et d’assainissement. Les communautés ont eu ainsi la possibilité de prendre des crédits à un taux d’intérêt plus faible (5-6%).
Pour cela, les groupes solidaires de 5 personnes ont manifesté leur intérêt auprès de l’ONG pour un crédit latrine. L’ONG et le comité communal d’assainissement approuvent la demande basée sur un devis de l’artisan maçon et donnent leur accord à la microfinance pour octroyer le crédit aux ménages. Ces derniers donnent leur aval pour que les fonds soient transmis à l’artisan maçon qui construit les latrines dans les ménages. 
Grace à cette innovation, 180.000.000 FCFA ont été mobilisés au 31 décembre par les IMF pour l’octroi des crédits à 1.200 familles en milieu semi-urbain et urbain, ce qui a permis de lever la contrainte financière. Un autre point fort est le recouvrement des crédits à 100% avec plus d’opportunités de crédit offertes à un plus grand nombre de familles. Cette initiative s’ajoute aux efforts du gouvernement et de l’UNICEF pour la promotion des bonnes pratiques d’hygiène et la Fin de la Défécation à l’Air Libre. 
 
Les leçons apprises de la seconde année de mise en œuvre du programme pays réconfortent la pertinence des stratégies retenues par UNICEF dans les théories de changement. Construisant sur la dynamique positive créée au niveau du gouvernement et des partenaires autour des innovations, UNICEF déploiera les efforts nécessaires pour leur mise à l’échelle à partir de 2021 en vue de l’accélération des résultats.

WCAR,"WCARO, Senegal",Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Reaffirming the KRC Agenda 

The KRC agenda has galvanized the full weight of the UNICEF presence in WCAR, combined with partners, and focused the WCARO contribution through a strategic common agenda, contributing to tangible progress towards the progressive realization of child rights at-scale with equity while enhancing accountability for results. 

Accordingly, through the mid-term review of the KRCs and the ROMP that took place in 2020, WCARO, in line with the strategic direction of the RMT, reaffirmed its commitment to the KRCs as the region’s strategic contribution to the Strategic Plan 2022-2025, as part of the Decade of Action towards the SDGs. It is essential to sustain and heighten the multi-sectoral and multi-country efforts, investments and approaches pursued by the region since 2018, acting on evidence and knowledge to refine approaches and strategies in favor of acceleration.

Shoring-up State and Household Resources in Favor of Children

Public finance took on heightened significance as an acceleration strategy as governments faced the competing imperatives of addressing the economic fallout of the pandemic, preparing to finance COVID-19 vaccines and assuring the continuity of routine social services with diminished revenue. WCARO is well positioned to advocate forcefully for protecting domestic public financing for social services and to support countries to secure and unlock additional external financing, while improving efficiency, transparency and focus of public spending, building on its efforts in 2020 supporting COs to update budget briefs and engage with IFIs. 

Social protection came to occupy a prominent place in the context of COVID-19 response, as a means of shoring-up household finances in a timely manner, thereby assisting households to avoid coping strategies that are harmful for children, such as withdrawal from school, child labor, child marriage and inadequate nutritional practices. Drawing from its experience in coordinating the COVID-19 social protection response and expansion measures in WCAR countries in 2020, WCARO is well positioned to advocate for investments in social protection systems and to provide policy advice on the design and targeting of cash transfers so that they reach the most vulnerable households.

Bridging the Digital Divide and Connectivity Gap to Leapfrog to Scale 

During the COVID-19 crisis, technology and digital solutions were embraced by WCAR countries with the promise of sustaining essential services in the face of restrictions on movements and gatherings. Though these offer an opportunity to leapfrog towards reimagined social services of the future with significantly wider reach, governments ought to attend to bridging the digital divide and connectivity gap so that the most deprived children are not left even further behind through such transformation. WCARO, through its strategic guidance to COs, can build on experience so far to highlight this issue in line with UNICEF’s equity focus.
  
Necessity of Emergency Standby Capacity

The experience of 2020 shows that standby emergency capacity is crucial to ensuring that UNICEF acts as a first responder in the face of growing conflicts, increasingly complex and concurrent epidemic outbreaks and other disasters. This is particularly the case in WCAR which hosts the greatest number of protracted emergency situations of all UNICEF regions (8 countries with interagency HRP). Preparedness merits increased attention in the next ROMP, alongside measures in favor of risk- and gender-informed programmes towards heightened resilience.

Maturing the Region’s Approach to the Continuum of Innovation, Evidence and Knowledge 

The WCAR experience since 2018 reveals the potentially transformative nature of a systematic approach to innovations, evidence and knowledge as part of a continuum.

In contrast with a scattered, isolated approach, the WCAR model – matured with the convening power and technical expertise of WCARO – involves the careful selection of pilot initiatives with scalability and sustainability in favor of the KRCs. Selected innovations are systematically scrutinized through evaluations, research and studies. In cases in which evidence substantiates the effectiveness of innovations, the WCAR model envisages that the region will systematically propel them towards scale-up, through fostering their uptake by governments and communities, as well as replication across countries. In the context of COVID-19, this approach enables the identification of acceleration strategies that have proven to be the most effective, or ‘COVID-proof’, in the midst of the pandemic. 

Duty of Care and Organization Culture as an Essential Enabler to Stay and Deliver for Children

The region’s longstanding commitment to discharging its duty of care and promoting a positive organizational culture as a key enabler of results for children – steered by WCARO – came to the fore in 2020 with the untold effects of COVID-19 on UNICEF personnel, particularly the most vulnerable and those in the most insecure and remote locations. As a testament to these efforts, the Global Staff Survey 2020 revealed that satisfaction of WCAR staff in terms of personal empowerment increased by 19% compared to the 2017, and WCAR earned the highest score among regions in the areas of security, measures taken in response to COVID-19 and knowledge and information sharing. As a result of WCARO’s efforts towards the resilience and wellbeing of the UNICEF workforce in in WCAR, UNICEF was in a position to stay and deliver for children in the midst of the pandemic.

Looking Forward 

In 2021, WCARO will take forward the lessons set out in this report as it completes the final year of the ROMP 2018-2021 and shapes the ROMP 2022-2025. Elements of the strategic focus of the next ROMP having emerged through the WCARO experience include: emphasizing acceleration strategies focused on achieving scale and sustainability of results with equity; fostering increasingly customized and context-responsive technical assistance; anchoring multi-sector ways of working for the delivery of coherent and holistic support to COs; and instituting a more adaptive, agile and fit-for-purpose business model. 

The key guiding principle underpinning these efforts will be the optimization of the WCARO contribution to accelerating progress towards the KRCs, including through humanitarian response – cognizant of the enduring effects of COVID-19 and seizing the opportunities having emerged in the midst of the pandemic – as the region’s strategic contribution to the UNICEF Strategic Plan 2022-2025 and therefore the SDGs and African Union Agenda 2063.
