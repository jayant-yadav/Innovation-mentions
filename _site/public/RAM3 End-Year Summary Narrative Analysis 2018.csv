Goal area 1: Every child survives and thrives; and Goal area 4: Every child lives in a safe and clean environment

The adolescent-led review of the ‘magic classroom’ programme and community pre-school programme produced several key lessons about both initiatives and about adolescent participation in programme review. For magic classroom: interactive education-awareness sessions with approachable content and skilled facilitators improves adult and children’s knowledge of water, sanitation and hygiene concepts; and playgrounds encourage children to attend school regularly;developcognitive and behavioural skills, and must be maintained as healthy, safe places. The adolescent-led review demonstrated that adolescents aged 15–19 years can be effective data collectors and analysts: with a few hours’ training and support from UNICEF staff, they collected high-quality data and performed preliminary analysis. They know the context and can help to reduce barriers between local and external evaluators. For example, one cohort of adolescent evaluators were of an indigenous group, and conducted the data collection in the villagers’ local language.

While young people are often interviewed and surveyed in planning, monitoring and evaluation activities, they are rarely involved in the design or evaluation of a programme, which can create a gap between UNICEF programmes and the youth. By involving young people in evaluations, UNICEF Cambodia carried out the commitment to Generation Unlimited. Adolescent participation helps design programmes that are focused on and geared towards the realities of the needs of this age group. 

Goal area 2: Every child learns

The 2018 outcome evaluation of the Capacity Development Partnership Fund identified lessons to inform the design of the third and final phase of the Fund (2018–2021) and the new Education Strategic Plan.  

Key lessons included: the need to implement capacity development strategies and action plans with a long-term approach to reach all levels of education (individual, institutional and organizational). Also: intervention planning and implementation should be inclusive and participatory among stakeholders; focus placed on coaching and mentoring to develop individual capacities and organizational learning through long-term interventions on-the-job and/or team-based. Efforts should be made to measure capacity-development at the organizational level. In addition, a cascade approach to training and capacity development results in better national coverage, effectively and cost-efficiently, especially in remote and poor schools. Finally, approaches and interventions such as Capacity Development Partnership Fund, should create an environment where local actors can take risks and innovate. Such measures would allow stakeholders to learn and apply new knowledge, and design new practices.

UNICEF Cambodia continued to prioritize evidence generation and lesson learning throughout 2018 in Goal area 2. Findings from the multilingual Education National Action Plan 2015–2018 evaluation and a country-led evaluation of the national scholarship programme commenced in 2018 to be available in early 2019. 

Other lessons learned in 2018 fromprogramme implementation and monitoring included: advocacy on politically- and socially-sensitive issues to ministry leadership with an informal ‘heads-up’ prior to formal discussions is effective, as is well-targeted provision of technical advice. There is a need to diversify UNICEF’s approach to training, with consideration of online learning options. The use of government processes (such as recruiting technical assistance) with UNICEF participation and quality assurance is an effective way to build government institutional capacity and makes for effective programming. Medium-term work plans help implementing partners think strategically and systematically. And the adoption of school-to-school partnerships for capacity building (e.g., in life skills) is more effective compared to capacity-building driven by the central level.

Goal area 3: Every child is protected from violence and exploitation

An evaluation of the UNICEF Cambodia child protection programme found that the programme’s aims and design reflect UNICEF’s global priorities, Agenda 2030 and development partner priorities, in particular with: addressing violence against children; family-based care and reintegration; and a system-building approach. The focus on reintegration was highly relevant in the Cambodian context, and a necessary step to child protection system building. While recognizing the relevance of the reintegration programme, a lesson from the evaluation was that the 30 per cent target was ambitious, especially as it should be in parallel to establishing broader child protection and response services to meet the needs of all vulnerable boys and girls. De-institutionalization and reintegration is a long-term and complex process that requires sustained support for the individuals and families affected, and which requires the Government, UNICEF, non-government organizations and other strategic partners to work together. 

Based on a sub-decree and accompanying commitment statement on the management of residential care centres; a mapping exercise; the Ministry of Social Affairs, Veterans and Youth Rehabilitation national action plan; five provincial operational plans’ target to return 30 per cent of children in residential care to their families by 2018; and on-going case management of children from residential care institutions, it is clear that the ministry is committed to a process to reform the child care system. This will be done through legislative reform (including sanctions) and programme services. However, despite ministry commitment, the importance of increasing budget allocations in line with the commitment to ensure funding mechanisms was a valuable lesson.

After the number of institutions and children living in them rose from 2005 to 2015, the numbers are stabilizing and falling. This was made possible through adoption of a holistic approach by Ministry of Social Affairs, Veterans and Youth Rehabilitation in partnership with UNICEF and Partnership Programme for the Protection of Children that addressed all components of the re-integration system from the regulatory environment to tracing children re-integrated to family or community-based alternative care. 

The formative evaluation also noted: there is now greater awareness of abuse and the need for child protection; cases of severe violence are coming to the attention of authorities; and increased awareness as a result of better reporting of violence cases should be supported by areferral system and adequate response services. The evaluation cautions that institutional knowledge of dealing with child protection is building slowly, and rests on few individuals. 

Cooperating with non-government organizations in the area of social welfare is important, given the strong presence of the organizations and the limited human and financial capacity of the Government. The Partnership Programme for the Protection of Children, established in 2011 as a tripartite partnership between UNICEF, Ministry of Social Affairs, Veterans and Youth Rehabilitation and Friends International (which coordinates nine additional civil society organizations, six technical partners and 40 community groups) has been a successful model of Government and civil society partnership. However, the child protection formative evaluation reported an over-reliance on non-government organisations. Thus, while non-government organizations will continue to play an important role in providing child-protection services, effort will be invested to support the Government to increase its budget investment in child protection services. 

Other successes documented by the evaluation included placement of new social workers at the provincial level; quality, coordinated child protection work at the sub-national level; capacity building resulting in change; and programmes that generated sustainable capacities at national and sub-national level. 

The evaluation reported that the UNICEF Cambodia child protection programme sets a strong base for developing a child protection system, but that such a system in Cambodia is a long-term project and has a long way to go. The evaluation recommended that UNICEF: strengthen the child protection system and services; build a new comprehensive child protection law; build government ownership of child protection with clear lines of responsibility and accountability; increase budget and provision of a minimum guaranteed level of service; professionalize child protection; and develop support services and alternative care services.

Goal area 5: Every child has an equitable chance in life

The evaluation of the CARD and UNICEF Cash Transfer Pilot Project for Pregnant Women and Children in Cambodia found that the Government-implemented programme is both possible and beneficial. In this pilot project, unconditional basic payments and conditional bonus payments were made to households with a pregnant woman and/or child(ren) under the age of five years to improve maternal and child health, nutrition and human capital development. The project aimed to reduce the effects of inter-generational poverty and food insecurity. This pilot was intended to test whether a scale up within existing government structures was possible.

Results from the study show that the transfers increased access to better (more nutritious and diverse) food while promoting health-seeking behaviours and improving health and nutrition knowledge. The recipients felt that the transfers helped meet their immediate needs, but they were not sufficient to meet all their health and nutritional needs. The project used the IDPoor card system to target beneficiaries. 

Results indicated that the health and nutrition sessions raised awareness and knowledge about health and nutrition. However, it was not clear whether a change in behaviour had been achieved. Conversely, education sessions were not sufficiently accessible or engaging for all, and there was no formal grievance redress system.

AMK Microfinance efficiently and effectively disbursed the funds and handled related issues. However, poor public transport, lack of rural banking facilities and sub-par internet and telecommunication networks will need to be improved upon scale up.

One success of the pilot was that the programme could be implemented using internal resources and allowances and did not require additional posts. The gaps and bottlenecks, such as insufficient training, could be easily addressed with a one-time expense. There will need to be collaboration between the Government, information system developers and local banks.

This pilot project made equity a priority by requiring that women be account holders for the cash transfers and thus could spend the cash in ways they saw fit. The project did not focus on awareness raising or education for men. 

The evaluation team identified the following additional lessons. First, emphasis should be placed on preparation, to ensure smooth implementation of the project and delivery of cash transfers to beneficiaries, both in terms of project details and coordination between organizations and bodies. Second, the health and nutrition education sessions are almost as valuable as the cash transfers: improving education, nutrition and health status will lead to improvements for children.  

Third, cash transfers should be smaller, regular payments. These were found to be used to meet nutritional needs and support changes in behaviour. However, whether co-responsibility should be included remains a question, given that it decreases cost-effectiveness and efficiency. If it is used, it should be monitored to track progress and ensure goals are being met. Further, in terms of financing, initially high costs for extra responsibilities should be considered, along with planning for any effects of inflation, climate change and disaster. Adequate resources must be allocated for administrative systems, information systems, supervision and monitoring and evaluation, as without them the project would be less effective and sustainable. Finally, husbands and fathers of beneficiaries should be encouraged to play a role in knowledge and behaviour change by attending education sessions. Women should remain beneficiaries of the cash transfers as this leads to empowerment in the community and increased likelihood that the woman is able to make financial decisions for the family.

EAPR,China,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
China is a world power and a global economy with massive international influence. It is predicted that by 2030, China will be the biggest global economy by a large margin. China’s economic growth and concentration on poverty alleviation has resulted in an unparalleled change for most Chinese families. However, this has not yet translated into high per capita income for all families. UNICEF must therefore continually adapt its work to ensure equitable development for all children in China, and at the Government’s request – continue to operate a regular country programme. 

In 2018, UNICEF China focused efforts to influence China’s international development investments for children, led by the Executive Director, and developed a new ‘China in the World’ strategy. UNICEF and China will be partners for children across five strategic pillars: public financing; supply/innovation; China-related multilateral banks and funds; private sector; and communication. 

In 2018, UNICEF China undertook an action-oriented mid-term review informed by the context of the SDGs, Government of China priorities and commitments, UNICEF’s Strategic Plan 2018 – 2021, the East Asia Regional Headlines and a rapidly evolving context in China. The mid-term review reflected on the lessons and constraints faced in delivering results for children in China and on necessary adjustments. It focused on five cross-sector programme areas, with the predominant criteria to focus on areas that impact more than one sectoral programme, including: adolescent programming; expanded, equity-focused programming in western China; a renewed focus on children in urban settings given the unparalleled rate of urbanization in China; leveraging digital space to promote child rights in programme delivery and advocacy; and how children with disabilities’ needs are integrated into programmes and what can be done to strengthen this. 

During the mid-term review, UNICEF China and the Government agreed on the following: to expand collaboration on adolescent development and participation; use the ‘child-friendly city’ initiative as an entry point to programming in urban areas; leverage digital platforms and technologies to deliver programme outcomes and expand reach; promote better gender equity and inclusion in all programmes; enhance equity focus, including an expanded reach in western provinces; and improve the access and use of data and evidence to support knowledge sharing in China and beyond. Investment and engagement in programming areas were reviewed to adjust to stay relevant, and ‘make space’ to include new strategic areas. 

The mid-term review was an opportunity to reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of the UNICEF China business model, ‘pilots to policy to results at scale’, and on the extent that gender is integrated into programmes. It was observed that the ‘pilots to policy to results at scale’ model is relevant and effective, but further effort will better document successes and lessons learnt to drive change in government policy and programmes. On gender, concerted efforts are needed to better implement the UNICEF global Gender Action Plan by strengthening how gender is integrated in the planning, monitoring and reporting stages of each programme. Adolescent education and WASH were identified as two priority areas for gender integration in 2019-2020. And new efforts are needed to build capacities both within and outside UNICEF China to collect sex-disaggregated data and commission research and publications with a gender lens. 

Pilot approaches are crucial to programming in middle-income countries. They provide insight into innovative solutions for complex development challenges and point to opportunities that improve public investments for children. Yet UNICEF in China has encountered difficulties in phasing out of pilots, as an external review of a major pilot programme revealed in 2018. Some pilots struggle to plan with a baseline survey, an intervention and non-intervention arm, and an agreed timeframe for showing results prior to exiting. While it is recognized that Government will not necessarily commit to finance until results are demonstrated, an agreement for sustainable financing in the long term, if and when results are shown, is a key to ensuring sustainability. A lesson learned in 2018 was to make sure these steps are taken in the future set up of pilots. 

Strengthened capacity and overall coordination is required incross-sectoral programming. Without office-wide buy-in, clear leadership and cross-sectoral budgets, the effectiveness of cross-sectoral work was diminished. Cross-sectoral priorities were redefined in 2018 in four new clusters: adolescents, the child-friendly city initiative, early childhood development and gender. They were anchored in specific programme sections, with a designated focal point, workplan and budget for 2019. 

UNICEF redefined its engagement with China in 2018 for the benefit of children globally. The Government of China’s South-South Cooperation Assistance Fund, the Belt and Road Initiative and institutions like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the newly established China International Development Cooperation Agency are unrivalled opportunities to secure partnerships for the betterment of children. UNICEF China needs to harness the reach, technology and resources of the private sector in China, expand its presence in the digital space, and identify innovations and accelerators that can be taken to scale benefiting children globally. 

Looking forward, as UNICEF China continues to be one of the largest United Nations’ country programmes in China, with a presence in almost all provinces, it will maintain its technical assistance, operations and action-orientated approaches appreciated by the Government. 

In 2019, UNICEF China will start developing its next country programme 2021-2025. Key considerations that will inform this process are how we will continue to meet the needs of underserved children and women in China, while strengthening our engagement with China to advance the SDGs for children in other developing countries.

EAPR,DP Republic of Korea,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
In 2018, with UNICEF support, significant advances were made in the realization of rights of children and women in the DPRK. However, they continued to face risks from frequent natural hazards, chronic food insecurity and insufficient national capacity to provide life-saving basic services such as health care and WASH. According to new evidence from the 2017 MICS, marked disparities and mutually reinforcing deprivations exist for children and women by geographical and wealth characteristics. Continued international support, following the humanitarian imperative and first call for children, is urgently required to address disparities so that no child is left behind and to prevent backsliding on achieved progress. 

In a complex operating environment, tangible humanitarian results in child survival and development and access to safe drinking water were achieved collaboratively in 2018. Correct distribution and use of assistance were documented by UNICEF international staff through enhanced field monitoring practices, and the effectiveness of that assistance was attested by independent evaluations. While stringent sanctions imposed on the country were not meant to affect humanitarian assistance, their unintended consequences hampered the humanitarian community’s and UNICEF DPRK’s ability to deliver, exacerbated by a decline in donor funding. 

Alignment with organizational priorities and opportunities for children 

Humanitarian action was identified as the primary cross-cutting priority of the UNICEF Strategic Plan for 2018–2021, focused on delivering on the organizational mandate to implement child rights everywhere, anytime. DPRK continues to face a protracted, underfunded humanitarian situation, which has worsened through consecutive years of drought and floods and is complicated by limited access to quality vital services. Geopolitical tensions increasingly crowd out the humanitarian imperative and first call for children among donors. 

Despite these challenges, there are numerous opportunities to accelerate progress for children in alignment with the Strategic Plan and regional headlines around Early Moments Matter, Safe and Sustainable Living Environment and Adolescent Potential Unleashed. To realize the rights of every child, especially the most vulnerable, UNICEF DPRK continued focusing primarily on the goals ‘Every child survives and thrives’ through the health and nutrition programmes, with ‘Every child lives in a safe and clean environment’ as an interlinked priority served by the WASH programme. 

While UNICEF DRPK does not have the financial or human resources to focus on ‘Every child learns’, it continued to gather data and evidence in the education sector to prepare for higher prioritization of this goal area, which also depends on more access to the country’s education system and data. ‘Every child has an equitable chance in life’ – which underpins the Strategic Plan as a cross-cutting goal and includes issues such as gender equality, the rights of persons with disability, human rights and adolescents – is pursued through all programmes as well as preparatory work on evidence and policies through the programme effectiveness and monitoring and evaluation components.  

While the programme is gender-sensitive and targets girls and boys equally, no specific gender results are targeted apart from a focus on adolescent girls’ health and nutrition. Available data and parity indices from the 2017 MICS show no sex-selective or discriminatory practices against girls up to higher education, but societal norms that prevent women from accessing leadership need to be challenged early and tackling them should be systematically mainstreamed in programming. 

In 2018, UNICEF DPRK conducted an internal strategic moment of reflection workshop to review and confirm its programme strategy considering the 2017 MICS results and trends observed in supported programme areas. The programme strategy’s unique approach of combining humanitarian action with the power of evidence to drive policy change and generate at-scale results through partnerships and joint action with the UN family and other partners was confirmed as a context-appropriate use of the UNICEF Strategic Plan enablers to ensure children in DPRK are not left behind. Key shifts made included deliberate and sustained attention to the humanitarian-development continuum, gender-responsive programming and challenging of unequal opportunities to survive and thrive, with the gender focal point newly located at the level of the head of programmes. The situation analysis update process, which will be concluded in 2019, provided an effective avenue to engage these shifts among an analysis and advocacy push for the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 

Evidence-based interventions and advocacy 

Evidence generation has proven crucial to addressing the underlying resilience depletion and structural causes of deprivation which exacerbate disaster risk and impact in DPRK. UNICEF continued to advocate with the Government and support CBS in improved collection, management and analysis of reliable data and evaluative evidence across all sectors, underlining how critical they are for humanitarian planning and effective, equity-focused policies. 

In a more open environment for data and information exchange, Government gave international experts access to CBS for the entire MICS process 2016–2018. It also supported a CMAM programme evaluation with unprecedented access to health facility records, disaggregated routine statistics and communities for a lot quality assurance sampling assessment to ensure effective service coverage in 2017. In 2018, opening up was sustained in publishing the 2017 DPRK MICS with disaggregation of all indicators by wealth index groups. 

With high international and national anticipation, the in-country launch by the UNICEF Deputy Executive Director for Field Results was organized simultaneously with a press conference held in Geneva by UNICEF East Asia and Pacific Regional Director to draw attention to the progress achieved for children in DPRK as well as the substantive challenges they still face. 

Further MICS-based analyses of disparities between provinces, areas of residence and households in the wealth groups was a breakthrough for programmatic targeting of the most vulnerable. The evaluation of the CMAM programme also presented a breakthrough, demonstrating the feasibility of high-quality, credible evaluations and their uptake in partnership with national institutions. In addition, the evaluation findings strongly validated UNICEF DPRK’s programmatic effectiveness and its relevance to children’s needs in responding to emergency-related spikes of malnutrition. External advocacy by UNICEF extensively publicised that the CMAM programme averted an estimated 7,581 under-five deaths and provided appropriate treatment for over 180,000 acutely malnourished children during 2015-2016.  

Commencement of the development of a new equity-focused situation analysis including the 2017 MICS data, evaluative evidence and changes in the policy environment was another sign of high-level commitment to advancing child rights and of the power of iterative trust-building through technical cooperation. The broad portfolio of both strategic policy and implementation documents adopted across all assisted sectors validated the approach of combining life-saving support with policy advocacy. In this context, generating and using reliable evidence for in-country and external advocacy as well as programme planning and performance reporting thus appears to be the support strategy with the highest potential for return on investment in terms of positive change for children. 

Joined-up approaches benefiting children 

Marked progress achieved in intra-government cross-sectoral coordination and in how UN agencies work together for results heralded a new era when joint mechanisms of Government-humanitarian partner coordination replaced formerly compartmentalized modes of cooperation. 

The Government made advances in recognizing the value added by whole-of-government consultation and coordination, as well as South-South exchanges, and coordination between and with its international partners. At the international level, government delegations participated in exchange and learning events with other states on evaluation for effective pro-social policies towards Agenda 2030 (EvalColombo 2018) and fostering of children’s development potential through early childhood care and education (Third Asia-Pacific Regional Policy Forum on Early Childhood Care and Education). The Government also views the Agenda 2030 process as an avenue to work in a more integrated fashion between various levels of governance and intends to create an SDG Steering Committee in 2019. 

Institutional counterparts expressed appreciation of the participatory methods used to further analyse 2017 MICS data and the implications for intersectoral response; joint analysis of the bottlenecks to rights realization in the situation analysis process; and the generation of a five-year WASH Implementation Strategy. In these processes, ministries and institutions with converging remits consulted on collaborative solutions and integrated plans of action on cross-sectoral policy issues. During the WASH strategy development, for instance, MoUM and the Ministry of Agriculture came together to deliberate on sanitation approaches to end ‘virtual open defecation’ while also catering for the equal priorities of safe water supply and optimal food production for the population. 

Entering a revitalized United Nations joint delivery model, premised on a strengthened Resident Coordinator function, collaborative results between sister agencies and UNICEF DPRK have already demonstrated the added value of joined-up work. The Resident Coordinator amplified the needs of beneficiaries and the harmonized position of UN agencies on crucial matters globally and voiced common advocacy points to the Government. These efforts were supported by information and common analysis of the issues by the relevant agencies. Finding solutions to important internal and external issues, such as access or the unintended consequences of sanctions on supplies and banking, were effectively advanced with fewer transaction costs for individual agencies. 

Based on their comparative advantages and strengths, development and humanitarian agencies and UNICEF entered synergistic arrangements in planning and implementing results in a way that tangibly enhanced outcomes for children and women. The system of sector working groups, comprising bilateral development agencies and resident INGOS, has proven an effective way to maximize the outcomes of humanitarian aid to the country. This system received the full support of UNICEF DPRK, which undertook substantial coordination work in the health, nutrition and WASH sectors. While this coordination has so far been most effective in humanitarian needs assessment and joint emergency response, it may be beneficial to expand it to ongoing programmatic interventions, including programming in convergence counties. Also, the principle of participation/co-chairing by national institutions of sector working groups, which is thus far only operational in the WASH sector, could be expanded to plan, monitor and report on shared results. 

In November 2018, the United Nations Development Group and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific co-hosted a Systemic Consultation Workshop on ways to continue to engage with DPRK under the UNSF 2017–2021 and contributions by resident and non-resident agencies in the SDG era. A first UN Country Team-Government steering meeting of the UNSF is planned in January 2019 to agree on strategic forms of coordination and cooperation within the framework of reinvigorated delivery as one UN. Increased intra-UN and UN-Government coordination are promising avenues to address operational challenges and operationalization of the SDG partnership, which UNICEF will actively follow up as related to the furthering of child rights. 

Operations and accountability in a specific humanitarian environment 

Principled humanitarian action and delivery against the UNICEF Core Commitments for Children in Humanitarian Action are essential parts of the agency’smandate and prioritized by its Strategic Plan for 2018–2021. Protecting children in protracted humanitarian situations such as DPRK’s while addressing their needs and vulnerabilities is essential to ensure progress towards Agenda 2030. At the same time, accountability for humanitarian effectiveness is crucial, and UNICEF DPRK developed mechanisms which enable assurance of the correct delivery and use of aid.  

In the context of heightened accountability requirements and external scrutiny, UNICEF continued focusing on field monitoring with the adoption of new standard operating procedures and minimum monitoring standards in 2018, as highlighted earlier. UNICEF DPRK institutionalized the yearly conduct of intensive monitoring rounds with external expertise, and this third-party monitoring confirmed the correct distribution and use of supplies in 100 per cent of sites visited. UNICEF international staff were also able to conduct monitoring in Jagang Province for the first time in October. An internal audit which focused extensively on context-specific risks and controls in UNICEF DPRK concluded with no high priority/risk recommendations, while making valuable recommendations for further improvements to strategic positioning and procurement and monitoring processes. 

In his 6 August 2018 report on the human rights situation in DPRK, the UN Secretary-General noted that: “Sanctions imposed on the country, while not intended to affect humanitarian assistance, have continued to generate serious, unintended consequences and major impacts on life-saving humanitarian programmes owing to disruptions to the banking channel, the breakdown of supply chains, delays in the transportation of vital goods into the country and a steady decline in donor funding”. 

The Secretary-General recommended that the international community provide adequate and sustainable funding for humanitarian assistance, especially food and medicine, with a view to improving humanitarian conditions and the human rights situation, and take urgent steps to minimize the adverse humanitarian consequences of sanctions imposed on DPRK by extending full support to the UN agencies working in the country. UNICEF was able to continue its life-saving humanitarian work for women and children, despite these challenges.  

Leaving no child behind 

During the first years of the 2017-2021 Country Programme, the geopolitical situation on and surrounding the Korean Peninsula has significantly improved. This development has arisen against the backdrop of a multi-year trend of steady marginal improvement in social sectors indicative of increases in children’s well-being and that of the population at large. While not yet conforming to the recommendation of the Committee on the Rights of the Child to open to scrutiny public finances and the specific ratios of Government expenditure directed to improving children’s lives, the Government has announced a strategic shift to developing the economy and lifting the living standards of people. It has also used domestic resources to co-finance vaccination and WASH programmes. Access to data, geographical areas and people for the humanitarian community have gradually become more open, and concerted situation analysis and policy development advice by a United Nations team and humanitarian partners working closely together is slowly receiving a warmer welcome. However, at the same time, humanitarian aid has been limited and certain transaction costs incurred in the implementation of humanitarian exemptions to the international sanctions. 

If 2019 continues unchanged, crucial interventions for safeguarding every child’s rights will be either difficult or impossible to implement. For instance, sanctions temporarily hampered progress on the right to safe drinking water. The iodization of salt, which is important to children’s cognitive development and a part of UNICEF interventions globally, is currently not implementable. Carriers are not willing to transport potassium iodate required for iodisation, because it is categorized as a dangerous good. In addition, external support for people affected by TB and malaria is only assured until 2020. 

However, the global pledges contained in the 2030 Agenda of Sustainable Development are made for every human being, without exception or exclusion. Children and their needs cannot be put on standby while solutions to the geopolitical challenges are being sought. Addressing these needs now is a must; ensuring the first call for children is answered is a duty. UNICEF DPRK will continue upholding a full and principled application of the humanitarian imperative and calls on all stakeholders to support children’s rights without reservations, to ensure that no child is left behind.

Workplanning processes. In 2018, adjustments to workplanning approaches were necessary to deliver UNICEF Pacific’s Multi-Country Programme (MCP) for 2018–2022, which shifts focus from a few countries to delivering support all 14 PICTs where children’s indicators continue to lag. The following three workplanning approaches were adopted by UNICEF Pacific: on plan on budget; sectoral annual workplans; and consolidated multi-sectoral workplans,  primarily with PICTs where programming is relatively small.  

The on plan on budget approach is considered innovative and a best practice because UNICEF-supported activities are incorporated into government annual operational plans (AOP) and budgets. UNICEF provides a letter of funding commitment for activities supported by UNICEF in AOPs and on how these activities are linked and contribute to government sectoral plans and results. This approach was first initiated in Kiribati, Solomon Islands (SLB), and Vanuatu by three UN agencies (UNICEF, UNFPA, and WHO) implementing the UN Joint Programme for Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health. UNICEF subsequently expanded the approach also to include education and WASH programmes. This approach supports UNICEF’s ongoing commitment to promote national ownership of Multi-Country Programme activities and ensures that delivery of activities harmonizes with national systems and procedures. It reduces transactional costs and demonstrates that UNICEF Pacific’s contributions and partnerships align with the Paris Principles of Aid Delivery.

Strengthening inclusive emergency preparedness and response through cluster while supporting new efforts for disaster risk reduction and resilience. Disaster risk reduction and resilience approaches ought to be better integrated. Given persistent inequities (particularly related to gender and children with disabilities) and increasing exposure to risks that continue to endanger the lives of children, UNICEF continued to enhance support for cluster coordination and dedicated attention to gender-responsive and inclusive efforts in disaster risk reduction and emergency preparedness and response. All countries and sectors do not realize this need and as such are not open to establishing relevant structures before disaster strikes.  

UNICEF demonstrated its ability to strengthen cluster coordination and related support during the Tropical Cyclone Gita response in Tonga, where the timely activation of the WASH emergency cluster enabled the country to quickly respond to WASH needs. UNICEF supported the education cluster to address coordination capacity gaps in the days following the cyclone, ensuring children could return to school within two weeks. UNICEF will provide support to strengthen capacities in Education in Emergencies (EiE) and expand EiE/Disaster Risk Reduction beyond the current focus on primary schools to include pre-primary and secondary as well. 

Innovative resource mobilization and strategic partnership. UNICEF Pacific diversified funding sources through innovative resource mobilization and strategic partnerships. UNICEF succeeded in leveraging substantial development partner and government resources for children. Efforts were made to leverage financing through bilateral programmes.UNICEF provided technical assistance to governments to directly access Official Development Assistance for WASH activities in SLB (funded by European Union), in Vanuatu(funded by the New Zealand Ministry of Finance and Trade), and in Fiji and Vanuatu (through climate financing).  

UNICEF engaged with multilateral and development banks on new funding opportunities and learned useful lessons. UNICEF used technical expertise to influence a US$25 million investment from the Asian Development Bank to introduce new vaccines in four PICTs and ensured that the technical design of the project conformed to global standards and international best practices. UNICEF also leveraged resources to build the evidence base and advocate for greater investment for children. Drawing upon evidence generated from a UNICEF-supported 2017 Integrated Child Health and Nutrition Survey to develop a technical concept note to address stunting at the request of the Government of RMI, more than US$12 million was leveraged from the World Bank to fight stunting during the first 1,000 days under the early childhood development umbrella over the next five years. Upcoming Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys in several countries will provide additional data that UNICEF will use in intensified evidence-based advocacy for sustained investment in children and social services. 

Demand for services and behaviour change. Demand for services remained low despite investments in system building and service provision. UNICEF support to key sectors in 2018 identified important limitations in system capacities to strategically promote and sustain positive practices and engage communities. Entrenched social norms continued to challenge programme effectiveness. For example, due to the low status of children and women in many PICTs, family reputations and community harmony tend to be prioritized over the individual well-being of children and their right to access justice. This hinders efforts to promote the adoption of positive practices for children and their access to basic child protection services. Demand generation and awareness-raising ought to be considered in the introduction of new programmes or modalities that are unfamiliar to service providers, families and communities. This is particularly relevant in the case of large-scale efforts such as the launch of the Accelerated School Readiness Programme (ASRP) in Kiribati and pre-primary year activities in SLB. 

Communication ought to be considered in innovations and new service models for child well-being and development to ensure that lessons learned from early adopters are shared and adjustments are made as required in a coherent and timely fashion. While some investment  was made in evidence generation and social data utilization, for instance, on stunting, research and disaggregated data relevant to changing behaviour and social norms wasnot robust enough to consistently inform evidence-based communication for development (C4D) strategies. Increased investment in evidence-based C4D is required, along with efforts to strengthen government systems and capacities for community engagement, to ensure activities go beyond ad hoc awareness-raising campaigns to systematized communication that promotes sustainable shifts in behaviour and social norms.

Pilot to scale. A key lesson learned in 2018 was the need to strengthen learning and build monitoring and research into pilots of new models from inception. The development of innovative models often has not been complemented by robust monitoring and data collection systems, which are required to capture the evidence needed to guide programme revision and to scale up planning. These systems are particularly relevant in taking to scale pilot programmes such as the Accelerated School Readiness Programme in Kiribati, pre-primary year activities in SLB and Community Facilitation Packages in Fiji, Kiribati, and Vanuatu. The initial implementation of child protection Community Facilitation Packages included one-off workshops for facilitators without adequate supervision, monitoring or evaluation mechanisms in place. Revisions to tools, materials, and implementation and coverage strategies are expected in 2019 designed to strengthen the packages. Across all its focus areas, UNICEF will work to enhance monitoring plans and complementary information management systems and build on existing government systems to ensure systematic data collection to promote learning for scale-up.

Constraints

Lack of reliable and timely data 
Availability and access to child-centred data remained a challenge. The PICTs have limited capacity to monitor the situation of children and track progress against key development goals. National statistical systems in the PICTs are among the weakest in the world and are chronically under-resourced in terms of qualified staff and operational budgets. Most PICTs also lack high-quality administrative data sources, such as education and health databases and civil registration records. These challenges are compounded by weak coordination and cooperation between and among government ministries, and low capacity to analyze data and translate numbers into policy-relevant information. 

The lack of reliable and timely data was a constraint in 2018 that impeded efforts to effectively target resources and programmes and track progress. Social surveys were infrequent and some PICTs, including Fiji, FSM, Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau, did not implement recognized survey tools such as Multi Indicator Cluster Surveys or Demographic and Health Surveys. When data did exist, it was often too dated to be useful. For instance, Demographic Health Survey data in Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu is more than a decade old. Per capita cost of conducting surveys in the Pacific is high compared to other regions, as populations are small and thinly spread, which might contribute to the infrequency of surveys.  

To address this constraint, UNICEF will continue to collaborate with UNFPA and the Pacific Community to support the administration of consistent surveys using the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey framework. UNICEF also will engage with other regional organizations, such as the Pacific Community, Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat and Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme, and with UN agencies, to complement existing efforts to improve administrative data sources. This will include innovations to enhance the range of data captured through tools such as Education Management Information Systems, and to provide equipment to clear backlogs in civil registration data. UNICEF will support Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu and Nauru to conduct Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys in 2019.

High exposure to climate change risks and adverse natural hazards
The PICTs continue to be exposed to a variety of hazardous events annually, including tropical cyclones, earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and drought. This has sometimes interrupted programme implementation. Many PICTs, especially Tuvalu, Kiribati, and RMI, the so-called ‘atoll states,’ are made up of atolls that are only metres above sea level. Pressure on infrastructure and public services in those countries can be expected to be especially acute. Thus, better integration of disaster risk reduction and resilience approaches is required.

The complexity of the programme environment
Delivering the Pacific Multi Country Programme within a complicated management and operating environment remained a challenge. The programme must respond to highly scattered populations, individual country ministries in each sector, and civil society and private sector partners in 14 countries. Most of the countries have no UNICEF staff. The vastness of the region results in very high transaction costs. The increased level of regular resources in the new Multi-Country Programme has allowed UNICEF Pacific to support a variety of critical programming needs to reach the most vulnerable and excluded children in remote islands in the 14 PICTs. South-South Cooperation in the Pacific sub-region has increased value for money as it bypasses the learning stage and group activities, therefore, reducing costs. UNICEF Pacific translates lessons from one country to initiatives in another. This interaction also leads to greater synergies and offers the opportunity for collaborative dialogue.

2018 marked the mid-point of the UNICEF Indonesia country programme. A Midterm Review exercise was conducted, beginning with an internal management retreat in February at which the country management team discussed a concept note that identified key cross-cutting issues to be considered.Those issues includedUNICEF’s strategy for taking pilot programmes to scale, theapproach to evidence-based programming, use of partnerships as a strategy to achieve planned results, and the approach to integrated programming (a key government priority). This led to an internal, office-wide midterm review exercise in May, conducted jointly with UNICEF China (which is on the same country programme cycle), and culminated in a combined mid-year review and midterm review exercise jointly with the Government of Indonesia in August. At the August meeting, a summary note and presentation were shared with partners that highlighted the key conclusions of the midterm review.

UNICEF Indonesia analysed its pilot-to-scale efforts to look at how the inherent challenges in conceptualization, design, implementation and scale-up of pilot programmes and projects might be overcome. The office-wide theory of change exercise conducted in 2017 was analysed, and a simplified conceptual framework for the process of modelling, planning, implementing, advocating for and scaling-up a successful pilot initiative was created. The analysis looked at several case studies and the broader literature on such initiatives.   

Four key success factors in this process were identified to help UNICEF programmes have greater impact on children in Indonesia.The first success factor identified for pilot scale-up through policy influence was recognition that the three key pillars of design, evidence and advocacy all are essential. For scale-up, a pilot needs proper planning, as well as documented evidence of success and a solid understanding of the surrounding socio-political environment, informed by trust-based relationships with key players to facilitate effective advocacy. Timing of such advocacy is key, as good evidence presented at the wrong time will not go far. The second success factor identified was on documentation and national alignment. Solid evidence-based documentation is necessary for pilots to scale up, including guidelines, costing studies, advocacy materials and evidence in the form of baselines and evaluations. Such evidence should be aligned with and/or be integrated into national plans from the outset. The third success factor identified was sustainability, which can be facilitated through deliberate capacity development plans to support long-term implementation after piloting. Replicability can be encouraged through simplicity and cost-effectiveness, both of which should be factored in from the outset. The fourth success factor was provincial buy-in. Pilots often take place at the district level, so provincial support plays a crucial role in securing political and financial momentum to influence scale-up.

UNICEF Indonesia reached three key conclusions on strategies for effective evidence-based programming. The first was the need to further integrate evidence generation with the knowledge management function. This would require the integration and alignment of research, evaluations, publications, knowledge products and communication materials under a comprehensive advocacy framework. The second was the need to further emphasize the Government’s role as the custodian of evidence for the country programme. This can be facilitated through more hands-on and side-by-side collaboration on evidence-generation, including sustained partnerships with influential academic institutions (both local and international). The third conclusion was that the timing for dissemination of knowledge products should be informed by the political dynamics of child-centred programming, to maximize the value of opportune entry points.

In 2018 UNICEF Indonesia conducted a formative evaluation of partnerships as a strategy to support the effective achievement of planned results. The evaluation was cross-cutting in nature and aimed to identify the optimal mix of partnerships in terms of type, modality and size, given the recognition that partnerships are the key to expanding influence and impact of the programme. The first conclusion was to acknowledge the key role that central government plays in the coordination, planning and replicability of programmes, as operationalized through the regular national-level planning and review meetings (‘Pokjas’). The Pokjas also help to ensure alignment of programmes with national priorities, which ensures long-term sustainability and integration with overarching theories of change across government that build on the strategic contributions and comparative advantage of respective development partners.

A second key conclusion from the partnerships evaluation was that  partnerships can be catalytic in themselves, from a results perspective, rather than purely as channels for funding. This approach would include greater engagement with the private sector for advocacy, beyond fundraising. Private sector engagement could also be supported by the global UNICEF Innovation Fund, which aims to influence how promising start-ups impact children (under the umbrella of UNICEF’s Child Rights and Business Principles business engagement agenda).  

A third key conclusion was on the expanded scope and modalities for partnerships with other types of influential partners, such as media, associations and faith-based organizations, to be pursued as a deliberate approach to expand the reach of UNICEF’s influence. The evaluation also concluded that there should be greater attention paid to engagement with the Government on public expenditure reviews for children, as the significant and decentralized nature of government financing in Indonesia allows for considerable scope and leverage points for UNICEF programming. Another conclusion was that Islamic financing, which is significant in Indonesia, deserves further attention. The evaluation also identified the need to continue expanding the donor partner base for UNICEF programmes, including with new and emerging donors, the domestic private sector and international foundations, as the nature of development cooperation in the country changes. 

The midterm review identified five areas of focus for integrated programming, which is a key government priority. A more deliberate approach to integrated programming can accelerate results for children by reinforcing synergies for child wellbeing (especially in early childhood development, adolescence, nutrition and parenting). Emphasis should be placed on enhancing girls’ education and learning (under the national cross-sectoral out-of-school strategy), in support of efforts to reduce child marriage. Capacity for data and analytics needs to be strengthened, especially with regard to SDG data visualization and use at national and sub-national levels. UNICEF prioritized an office-wide digital strategy to cover digital work for programmes, communication, advocacy, engagement, fundraising and technology-for-development.

In November, UNICEF Indonesia conducted an after action review of the emergency response in Central Sulawesi and Lombok. This was an internal exercise informed by a pre-session on the ground in Palu. Participants included staff and consultants who had either spent significant time in Central Sulawesi and/or Lombok, or who had otherwise spent a significant amount of time working on the emergency over the October-November 2018 period, including surge staff deployed to Indonesia. Recommendations from the after action review included: For the immediate recovery phase, a key priority is to continue strengthening information management capacity of clusters, partners and staff. Information management is a key component of emergency coordination and helps ensure that partners are on the same page and working together toward agreed-upon cluster-wide targets. UNICEF staff, consultants and surge support worked with government and civil society organization implementing partners to streamline the 4Ws cluster management tool, including data inputs from the ground and data extracts to inform situation reports. Continued strengthening of relationships with national line ministries around the emerging areas of shock-response social protection and cash-based assistance in emergencies was noted as an area for immediate attention, through an inter-agency government-led working group led by the Ministry of Social Affairs.

The after action review identified priorities for the transition to regular programming at the end of the response phase in mid-2019. Those included a closer link between emergency response and regular programme activities, to facilitate the humanitarian transition to development, and adding Central Sulawesi as a further focus province for Government of Indonesia-UNICEF programme cooperation, to help ensure sustainability of interventions. A follow-up lessons learned exercise will be conducted with line ministries and other agencies (under the Humanitarian Country Team) to inform future humanitarian response.

The bulk of recommendations from the after action review focus on emergency preparedness in the longer-term. Potential areas for follow up include revisiting the possibility of pre-positioning supplies in country (a practice that was discontinued previously due to improved government response capacity), the need to develop stand-by contingency partnerships and agreements for in-country services and procurement, a potential inter-agency review of how to trigger national government financing for sub-national emergencies, and further mainstreaming of disaster risk reduction activities into the regular programme workplan (including through greater use of risk analysis and risk-informed programming).

Lessons learned
One of the key lessons learned during 2018 was the importance of sub-national-level coordination. The capacities and information systems for sub-national level planning, monitoring and coordination need to be continuously strengthened to increase their effectiveness in addressing child deprivations in a coordinated and integrated manner. The use of participatory approaches when building capacity at the district level is necessary to ensure ownership.

There is a need for better targeting to reach the most disadvantaged children in remote and rural areas. The selection of programming areas and interventions will be based on the data and analysis that became available during 2018. The findings and provincial deprivation analysis revealed by the multi-dimensional overlapping deprivations analysis will serve as a guide for improve targeting and programme coverage. 

The need for risk-informed sector planning and integration of disaster risk reduction in sector strategies and plans. The Attapeu emergency identified capacity gaps for emergency preparedness and response planning at both national and sub-national levels, which has created demand in the country for risk-informed development planning and programming to build resilient communities and achieve sustainable development and growth. 

Constraints
The major constraint experienced in 2018 was the flood emergency in Attapeu Province and others, since it required UNICEF Lao PDR to divert some financial resources and staff and re-focus programme implementation. This led to delay and postponement of some activities and priorities planned for 2018. 

While several efforts were made to enhance the capacity of service providers, duty-bearers and decision-makers these activities need to be continued with a stronger focus on system strengthening to ensure quality service delivery. 

Coordinating programme planning and monitoring of results, especially at the sub-national level, requires significant efforts to bring the related sectors together in a coordinated, integrated and convergent approach to addressing multidimensional poverty and deprivation. This need was highlighted in the recent multiple overlapping deprivation analysis. 

Several social norms and cultural barriers hinder the adoption of positive parenting practices and healthy behaviours. The parenting package was being finalized at end-2018, and will be implemented by the Lao Women’s Union and other institutions to address these barriers.

"
EAPR,Malaysia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
The mid-term review of UNICEF Malaysia’s country programme, conducted from May to August of 2018, provided an opportunity to assess progress made, identify winning strategies and address weaknesses to maximize results. Three main lessons emerged from the analysis, notably the effectiveness of a multi-sectoral programming approach and integrated campaigns, and the need to strengthen private-sector engagement to reach results at scale. Evidence-based advocacy is at the core of UNICEF’s work in middle- to high-income countries such as Malaysia. Drawing on lessons from the past, UNICEF broadened its partnership and constituent base to expand its reach and voice around issues affecting children, making effective use of influencers and social media to maximize reach across the country and sustain the debate to effect policy change. Shaping the message to address the evidence resulting from its research, and proposing policy recommendations based on global good practice from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries resonated with the Malaysian public and Government. 

Consultations and the involvement of the private sector, top academics and economists, members of parliament and civil society prior to and immediately after the launch of UNICEF Malaysia’s urban poverty study validated the findings and amplified the call for Government to address them. Malaysia’s adoption of the multi-dimensional poverty index as a measure of poverty, and the focus on children’s well-being and addressing malnutrition described above can in large part be attributed to this approach. Similarly, approaches used to promote inclusive education, ending child marriage and on- and-offline bullying are bringing about incremental change.

The initiation of integrated campaigns this year, in line with UNICEF’s global supporter engagement strategy, proved effective in simultaneously supporting its programmatic and fundraising goals. For example, initiatives undertaken in support of the global #EndViolence campaign were integral to UNICEF Malaysia’s advocacy strategy to end child marriage and bullying. Collaboration between the communication, innovation and private sector fundraising programmes and the partnership unit led to innovations such as the use of U-Report to poll donors on issues and use of social marketers to engage the public provided a more personalized approach. 

Collaboration also strengthened UNICEF’s message and voice. Amplification through social media, driven by the marketing and communication teams, enhanced brand recognition and visibility. Drawing on lessons learned from 2018 experience, forward planning and a call for action from the public, with guidance on concrete things they can do on an individual basis to effect change, will strengthen UNICEF Malaysia’s campaigns in 2019. 

The multi-sectoral approach, initiated around disability through the ‘flagship’ concept, has proven its effectiveness in maximizing results. Promoting joint ownership for the results, it has helped mainstream disability, invested an inclusive ethos into our work and externally led to a more inclusive education system initiated by the announcement of the ‘zero-reject policy’ by the Ministry of Education, which marks a very welcomed policy shift for children with disabilities. The recommendations of the forward-looking evaluation on disability due in Q2 2019 will help strengthen the approach and support its adoption across results areas.

The integration of UNICEF’s strategic approach was enhanced by the decision to create a separate unit for behaviour change communication reporting directly to the head of programmes, to strengthen office capacity to create an enabling environment for policy implementation and change. Another lesson learned was the need for an adolescent and youth engagement strategy to ensure a coordinated approach and to support Malaysia’s engagement in ‘Generation Unlimited’, launched by the United Nations Secretary-General at the General Assembly in September. 

Malaysia offers substantive opportunities to engage the private sector in sustained interventions for children, beyond one-off events or projects on child rights, and to leverage existing opportunities for social impact investment, including financing from Islamic sources. UNICEF Malaysia’s capacity to tap into this will require a strategic shift and internal capacity-building to better understand industry players and how to engage to scale up results for children. 

This will require UNICEF Malaysia to research and draw on the expertise of its private sector fundraising team to market development and rights-based language into shared-value propositions with industry and individual corporations. As a first step to strengthen this important pillar of cooperation, UNICEF Malaysia has created a private sector engagement unit and will integrate its corporate social responsibility and fundraising initiatives when approaching the private sector with the children’s agenda. 

At the national level, the lack of a coherent policy to address the issue of undocumented, stateless, refugee and migrant populations from a human security, human development and humanitarian perspective, is perhaps Malaysia’s biggest challenge to achieving the SDGs. Policy recommendations to address the findings of the UNICEF Sabah urban child poverty study and the UNCT mapping of undocumented, stateless and migrant populations in Sabah in 2019 will provide best practice solutions that can be tested both with United Nations support and through the EU-UNICEF multi-country project on protecting children affected by migration in Southeast, South, and Central Asia. Opposing views in Government about how to move forward in relation to this demographic trend have significantly delayed implementation of this project in Malaysia, although growing recognition and willingness to move forward, notably by the Sabah State government, is encouraging.

A Malaysia case study– conducted as part of a regional review on national evaluation systems and capacities to achieve the SDGs– identified political will and commitment as essential to the formulation of a national evaluation system to support achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the ‘leave no-one behind’ principle. The case study noted a prevailing negative association with evaluation, which tends to be perceived as a form of interrogation, with failure seen as grounds for punitive action rather than a pathway for learning and improvement. As a result, poor performance is hidden. 

The case study highlighted the specific issue of data overload associated with capturing and tracking progress on the SDGs. In response, UNICEF and the United Nations Development Programme will support the Government’s department of statistics and economic planning unit to streamline and integrate data sources with a solid database on the SDGs to monitor, report and evaluate progress. There is also a need to increase the country’s statistical capacity, improve the quality of disaggregated data and tap into administrative data, geospatial information and real-time environmental data, in addition to implementing routine censuses and surveys. UNICEF Malaysia will continue to support country-led evaluations focusing on governance, equity and human rights in order to harness the power of evidence, making it more inclusive and transparent, and vastly increasing the reach and impact of evaluative information for the betterment of all.

UNICEF Malaysia aims to achieve results at scale for children through policy and legislative change and partnerships. Its capacity to do so will be enhanced by the structural and strategic changes adopted at the mid-term review of the country programme in response to: lessons learned over the last two years of programme implementation, findings of ongoing research and the three formative evaluations on our approach to disability, innovation and private sector engagement. An advocacy strategy and calendar will guide UNICEF’s integrated campaigns and advocacy work and facilitate forward planning. This will be further facilitated by a ‘supporter engagement strategy’ comprising a volunteer engagement component to enhance UNICEF’s brand recognition. Adolescent and youth engagement will be supported by technical assistance for developing and coordinating strategy, and the private sector engagement strategy outlined above will be tested in an iterative manner to benefit all children in Malaysia.

EAPR,Mongolia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Working at scale
Across all sectors within UNICEF’s mandate, it was acknowledged that programming for at-scale results secured better visibility and respective buy-ins from national and local partners, which eventually contributed to better programme positioning and delivery. Examples include UNICEF’s engagement in the air pollution and health agenda, approval of the Food Fortification Law, and local policies and water safety plans, all of which helped win support from broader, non-traditional partners and decision-makers at various levels, including at the community level. 

Replication of child-friendly communities 
The lessons learned from the implementation of the child-friendly community model in the geographic focus areas  indicate that the model can serve as a catalytic strategy to bring together relevant stakeholders (duty-bearers and duty holders) in analyzing the situation, planning integrated interventions and monitoring the progress for children at the sub-national level. The model provides a unifying focus for all stakeholders and enhances their commitment for children. Those commitments were evidenced in major steps taken by local governments in the geographic focus areas, including approval and implementation of the provincial sub-programmes for children and increase in investment for children. The Authority for Family, Children and Youth Developmentand UNICEF will continue joint efforts toward the institutionalization of the child-friendly community model for national-level replication, thus ensuring the sustainability of interventions. 

PFM for children
UNICEF’s continuous advocacy for financing of child protection services resulted in an increased allocation, from 5 billion MNT in 2018 to 8 billion MNT in the 2019 budget. UNICEF supported costing of child protection services that provided estimates on expenditures required for implementation of the law on child protection. This costing exercise was combined with capacity building of relevant government officials, which generated support from the Ministry of Finance at the budget planning stage and helped policy makers take informed decisions on budgeting. Year-end reports indicated that the budget was extensively used for capacity building activities for child protection service providers and that UNICEF should continue providing technical support in the area of expenditure tracking of the allocated budget. UNICEF is discussing such plans with the Ministry of Finance for the next year.

UNICEF, in collaboration with SDC, also successfully advocated to the Government of Ulaanbaatar to allocate approximately US$230,000 in the local 2019 budget for measures to mitigate the impacts of air pollution on maternal and child health. This showcased that working closely with development partners and local government can result in significant additional public finances for children.

Sustainability
Khuvsgul province (one of UNICEF’s geographic target areas in the previous country programme 2012-2016), with UNICEF Mongolia’s technical support, developed and approved a Child Friendly Province sub-programme to ensure sustainability of the joint programme for children. The provincial sub-programme was implemented in 2018. 

A monitoring trip conducted by UNICEF Mongolia to assess the sustainability of the programme concluded that the sustainability plan was implemented well and local government remained highly committed to ensuring sustainability of the results achieved. This was evidenced by the increased investment for children, prioritization of child rights in the province’s long-term plan until 2030, and inclusion of UNICEF-supported facilities’ maintenance and operation costs in local budgets. 

There were a few areas where the local government struggled to ensure sustainability of programmes. For example, the Reach Every District and Sub-district Strategy (REDSS strategy) in the health sector could not be maintained due to lack of local budget. For some UNICEF-supported WASH facilities in schools and dormitories at sub-district level, local governments faced a number of challenges to properly maintain waste management. The most important lesson UNICEF Mongolia learned from this experience was that  any intervention it develops and pilots needs be designed as a full package that includes all important aspects of sustainability for it to be replicated at larger scale.

EAPR,Myanmar,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
2018 was the first year of the new UNICEF Country Programme, so it was expected it would take time to put in place the various planning, programming and operational elements needed to commence implementation. With the facilitation and coordination of the Ministry of Planning and Finance, the Multi-Year Work Plans for 2018-2019 were finalized and signed off by the respective government ministries and by UNICEF before the end of the first quarter of the year. Based on those plans, an extensive process involving soliciting and evaluating expressions of interest was undertaken to identify suitable civil society organizations as partners for the relevant activities. This process led to a more transparent and justifiable selection of partners and provided an extensive database of potential future partners. 

The monitoring and evaluation framework for the country programme was put in place, with extensive use of the standard indicators as well as the development of a results tracking and monitoring framework that facilitates the regular review of progress against key indicators for all sections. 

The country context poses significant challenges across the whole programme, particularly in terms of the need to address both humanitarian and development priorities, as well as the constraints in mobilizing adequate funding. The rapidly changing context means that UNICEF needs to constantly keep close oversight of programme direction, funds, budgets and staffing levels and be prepared to make adjustments as necessary. The ongoing review of the CPMP is an example of this oversight.

Lessons learned and constraints experienced in the each particular goal area are summarized below. 

Goal area 1: Every child survives and thrives
UNICEF and its partners faced continuing physical access constraints in humanitarian and conflict-affected areas, which slowly improved towards the end of the year, but led to underachievement of some HAC targets in the health and nutrition sector.

The emergency paediatric care programme greatly increased the ability of staff to implement changes in practice. Integration of technical training and quality improvement initiatives were supported with mentoring triggered corrective actions. Some systems, particularly around information management, showed less progress. This suggests the important role of senior hospital leadership in supporting the implementation measures to create an enabling environment for trainees to apply their newly acquired skills. 

Key lessons learned in nutrition included the importance of strengthening partnerships and forging alliances with other UN agencies and partners, including the World Bank, donors and nongovernmental organizations to leverage resources in a sector that has limited funding, as well as to conduct joint advocacy. Joint advocacy played a catalytic role in high-level government multi-sectoral coordination and partner-coordinated plans led by the Ministry of Health and Sports to scale-up nutrition in conflicted affected areas. The Scaling Up Nutrition country network, in which UNICEF continued to be an active player, was a critical platform in Myanmar, bringing together key stakeholders toward these efforts.

Social behaviour change communication support on the maternal and child cash transfer programme was delayed due to coordination challenges between the Ministry of Health and Sports and Department of Social Welfare. UNICEF will support the Ministry of Health and Sports to develop a national social behaviour change communication/communication for development strategy in 2019, which will be rolled out in parallel with maternal and child cash transfer expansion. 

Goal area 2: Every child learns
One of the lessons learned through the review of the child friendly school teacher training completed in 2018 was the need to emphasize the institutionalization process. Taking this into consideration, UNICEF supported the establishment of a reference group to oversee a review that ensured government ownership and led to the decision to develop a national framework for In-Service Teacher Education, also known as Continuous Professional Development. This work was part of UN joint work in this area. UNICEF collaboration with UNESCO will further support the Ministry of Education in this area.

During 2018, programme implementation was affected by several challenges. Funding limitations affected UNICEF’s ability to support Education in Emergencies. Only 43 per cent of the targeted amount was mobilized. Going forward, UNICEF will increase efforts to mobilize resources, jointly with other UN agencies and partners. The Government’s long approval process for activities and lack of clarity on roles and responsibilities among different stakeholders adversely affected work plan implementation. UNICEF promoted dialogue and consensus building among those players. Limited access to some conflict-affected areas limited UNICEF’s ability to monitor programmes. 
UNICEF will continue to explore options to address that challenge. 

Going forward, UNICEF will continue to partner with the Government and others to ensure that all children in Myanmar have their right to quality education fulfilled. 

Goal area 3: Every child is protected from violence and exploitation
Alliances with other UN agencies and institutions played a critical role in 2018. This included partnerships with the UN Population Fund UN Women, the International Labour Organization and RCO to ensure shared technical and advocacy positions on child marriage, age of sexual consent, criminalization of child abuse and introduction of the minimum age of entry into employment in relation to the revised Child Law. Collaboration among UN heads of agencies was leveraged to advance the children and armed conflict agenda as part of human rights protection and promotion in Myanmar. UNICEF made sure heads of agencies were regularly informed of technical level discussions and agreements, which contributed to creating a common voice and advocacy messages on children and armed conflict across the UN System. 

Goal area 4: Every child lives in a safe and clean environment
Innovation is a prerequisite for scaling up of rural sanitation (open defecation-free campaign initiatives) and school WASH programmes. The new programming models and approaches introduced by UNICEF for mainstreaming open defecation campaigns (in Southern Shan) and school WASH programme (in Kachin and Chin) into the government system achieved positive results. 

Results in the rural water supply sub-sector were very encouraging. UNICEF introduced community managed household water metering systems in 226 villages in 2017-2018, and the Department for Rural replicated and scaled up this approach to 1,269 villages in 2017-18.

Goal area 5: Every child has an equitable chance in life
Implementation of activities was often affected by turnover of staff, changes in prioritization within the Government, or miscommunication. This can be addressed by improved micro-level joint planning with counterparts at the beginning of the year and clearer communication, including through assignment of focal points.

Looking forward 

Going forward, UNICEF Myanmar will transition to the second year of the country programme using the approved multi-year work plan 2018-19 as the basis for activities. The CPMP review process will be completed during the first quarter of 2019, resulting in a strategy to address working efficiently between the country office and field offices; increasing presence in Nay Pyi Taw; and affordability based on funding availability. During the second half of 2019, a substantial review of progress against the MYWP 2018-19 will be carried out, which will then inform the preparation of a one year extension  and provide some indication of the issues that will need to be looked at in more detail leading up to the midterm review of the country programme in 2020.

"
EAPR,Papua New Guinea,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
In 2018, UNICEF Papua New Guinea underwent an audit to assess the adequacy and effectiveness of the it’s governance, risk management and control processes. The audit identified areas where further action was needed to better manage risks to UNICEF’s activities. In discussion with the audit team, UNICEF Papua New Guinea is undertaking measures to address these risks with the support of the UNICEF East Asia and Pacific Regional Office, with six measures implemented as high priority requiringimmediate management attention. These are: 
Implement a data strategy and action plan focused on the most critical data needed to better inform and support evidence-based planning and reporting; 
Reinforce oversight of risk management; 
Identify and address the key bottlenecks in the selection process and the causes of prolonged vacancies. Expedite the planned recruitment of human resources unit staff; 
Reinforce management of outstanding direct transfers and develop capacity of staff and implementing partners in cashtransfer processes; 
Ensure that micro-assessments and assurance activities are adequately planned, risk-based, implemented and monitored, and; 
Increase oversight of the quality of donor reports with a mechanism for donor feedback. 

During the year, several constraints were identified with appropriate mitigation strategies developed and implemented. As a result of internal capacity constraints processing high-volume contracts, UNICEF has adopted an open selection process to partner with CSOs to increase efficiency in the contractual process. To address weak governance, a lack of systematic budget allocations, inadequate and ad hoc service delivery and monitoring mechanisms, chiefly among local government partners, UNICEF is taking a capacity development approach and looking at geographic, partnership and programmatic convergence in line with the UNICEF CPD, Strategic Plan, UNDAF and interdependent results of the SDGs. This approach will strengthen resources and support child-friendly local governance from planning to implementation, including monitoring and evaluation.  

The Ministry of Finance suspension of NDOE’s account, citing that it did not comply with the Public Finances Management Act resulted in UNICEF’s education programme adopting alternative measures, such as direct payment to service providers and mobilization of civil society partners.  

Further capacity development of key implementing partners to deliver and monitor services for children with disabilities is required. There is also an acute need for further technical assistance to strengthen the collection of relevant comparable data on disability and to support research on disability and related services.  

To address the lack of reliable and accurate systematic and routine data for evidence-based decision-making which is a major constraint, UNICEF Papua New Guinea developed a data strategy in support of the 2018–2022 Country Programme, as part of the global Data for Children initiative. Under this strategy, key partners will be supported to centralize data collection, management, analysis and dissemination to improve decision-making in line with national and international development priorities. Increased emphasis on data generation and analysis to establish baselines, measure programme progress and inform longer-term planning is a core component of UNICEF’s support to the SDS. 

The availability of sufficient and competent human resources is a challenge to planning, service delivery and monitoring across all sectors. This is particularly prominent in the health sector, where there is a critical shortage of health workers compared to WHO standards, while PNG ranks in the bottom 15 countries in Save the Children’s Health Worker’s Reach Index. While working within this context, UNICEF aims to ensure that all health workers in contact with pregnant women, mothers and newborns receive EENC coaching.  

Poor infrastructure such as transport links, offices, schools and health facilities lacking in equipment also compromises the gains in building skills and quality improvement. Almost 40 per cent of primary health care centres are either closed or non-functioning due to lack of staff, tribal conflicts, and inadequate supplies. Basic infrastructure, such as the availability of running water in hospitals and health centres is critical for ensuring the quality of health service provision. Lack of water in children’s wards and labour wards, for example, increases the risk of infection. Health workers are not able to put into practice skills and knowledge obtained during the EENC coaching in such disadvantaged situations. This increases the risk of post-partum complications and septicaemia. 

There are concerning capacity gaps in overall supply chain management, from forecasting procurement and storage to distribution and end-user monitoring. Availability of authentic data is another challenge that has led to inadequate policies and programming as well as resource allocation by government at the national, provincial and district levels. Quality of care due to poor reporting and a lack of quality mentors and resources are major bottlenecks to improving the quality of health services. As a result, UNICEF is supporting NDOH in incorporating EENC indicators in the National Health Information System towards a timely and quality reporting system and expanding partnership with academic institutions and professional societies to increase the pool of quality mentors. 

To address the challenging physical and social environments of a diverse population with people largely living in rural areas, many of which are relatively inaccessible, PNG developed a tripartite system of decentralisation with national, provincial and local levels of government and four levels of administration (national, provincial, district and local level government). In recent years DDAs have emerged as another prominent tier of government, often with significant resources outstripping other decentralised levels. According to the 2014 PNG National Human Development Report, the country has “a complex (and hence costly) decentralised system of government” which is a “consequence of a diverse population that retains a stronger allegiance to and trust towards sub-national levels than national”.  

The Government of PNG is committed to further devolution of power, and this presents both challenges and opportunities. Challenges include high cost of reaching and access to remote populations as well as resources and implementation capacity in the public sector, particularly at decentralised levels. Opportunities include the ability to target resources and interventions where they are most needed and can have maximum impact as well as to develop capacity and rollout child friendly local governance initiatives, placing the rights and needs of children at the centre of local planning and implementation.  

Key lessons learned included the need for: 
An improved focus on ensuring UNICEF strengthens support to the Government in data collection, management, analysis and dissemination to improve equity-based, gender-responsive and risk-informed development planning and emergency preparedness;  
Enhanced advocacy for scale-up of proven pilot interventions, such as the hypothermia alert device and nutrition; and  
Developing further partnerships with the private sector to support in delivery of services, building on their support during the earthquake and polio emergency responses.

EAPR,Philippines,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
The end-of-country programme cycle review with the National Economic Development Agency and implementing partners captured the learning on UNICEF’s change strategies. Examples are outlined below. 

Harnessing the power of evidence as a driver of change for children: Modelling the First 1,000 Days

Considerable progress took place in the development of policies to address undernutrition in the Philippines. The Philippine plan of action on nutrition provides a framework for multi-sectoral interventions with special focus on the first 1,000 days of life. However, high rates of stunting persist, and this positive policy environment needs to be implemented by local governments, with support from the DoH and key member agencies of the National Nutrition Council. 

During the last two years of the country programme, UNICEF decided to develop new ways of creating evidence, by (1) bringing together all programmes and developing scalable models for national government planning and (2) adopting a mechanism for implementing an integrated programme for the First 1000 Days at the local level in 2016. UNICEF took an area-based approach by bringing together specialists from the different sectors (health, nutrition, education, child protection, and disaster risk reduction) to develop a coordinated and coherent approach. This integrated approach identified four local government units with which UNICEF should worked to develop integrated programming. Given the commonality of public financial management and governance and challenges across all sectors, the social policy team led the approach.

A workshop on lessons learned with partners in 2018 identified three initial results: 1) policy changes were adopted at the local level; 2) the First 1,000 Days programme was incorporated into local government planning, budgeting and existing services and structures and; 3) there were improvements in the quality of service delivery. 

The workshop also identified some constraints: 1) limited availability and quality of data, especially at the sub-national level; 2) lack of clarity on leadership and specific roles of agencies to ensure programme integration; 3) some key coordination structures existed but were non-functioning; 4) geographically isolated areas were hard to service, especially if the local governments had limited financial and human resources. 

For UNICEF Philippines, three key overall lessons from the collective learning stood out: 
1) integration can happen at key stages of programming, but does not need to happen at every stage. Sectors need to plan, monitor and review together, but implementation can be separate. 2) Integration at the local government level is challenging because of demands coming from national level. There are too many guidelines, directives and standards issued by different national government agencies and inter-agency councils. 
3) Prioritization is key, given the limited time and human and financial resources available to local government units.  

The learning from this approach can be applied across sectors in their efforts to plan and budget at the local government level. Disaster risk reduction, climate change resilience and emergency response could benefit from more integration, as could adolescent programming. The process of prioritization should involve the key decision-makers (i.e., local chief executive) to ensure their buy-in and commitment to implement activities

A fourth lesson, related to the scalability of models, was identified in mid-2018, building on the country programme evaluation and partnership consultations for the design of the new country programme. UNICEF’s partnership outreach focused mainly on local governments, the operational level that is accountable for delivering services. A key overall learning, also applicable to other models, was the importance of working with all levels of government to effect positive change for children nationwide. UNICEF should partner more strategically with different levels of government in the design of pilots and models, to ensure that those responsible for scale-up (typically at the provincial level of government) are involved. In addition, UNICEF and partners realized that leadership and governance are often contextualized as centralized (legislation, policy and planning, regulation). By working directly with the Department of Health, UNICEF’s efforts to support the roll-out of key plans such as the Philippine plan of action for nutrition in priority areas and the adolescent health and development programme 2018-2023, helped to scale up and strengthen access to and use of services, as well as to inform policy. 

Programming for at-scale results for children
In 2009 UNICEF Philippines supported the DoE to implement the essential health care programme (EHCP) in more than 3,000 schools. In 2012, UNICEF HQ and Germany’s development assistance agency developed the WinS ‘three star approach’ based on this model– an incremental approach to improving WASH behaviour and conditions in schools using the EHCP model. 

In 2018 UNICEF and the DoE continued the work on generating evidence, particularly in relation to behaviour-change. Two ongoing projects are underway:
1) The HiFive for HySan behaviour-change tools–action research that tests a behaviour- change approach using disgust, attractiveness and affiliation to motivate independent hand-washing behaviour.
2. #MeronAko (‘I Have’) Campaign, which is developing and testing a communication for development approach to develop materials and tools for delivering MHM lessons through classroom instruction and extra-curricular school activities.

Both projects are guided at all stages by DoE at the central, regional and division levels. The aim is for these tools to be adopted for nationwide use.  

The WinS experience provided three key lessons:

1. Policy first. It was strategic that the policy was formulated and issued prior to the formulation of the ‘three star approach’ (and not the other way around or in parallel, like the initial attempt in 2013). The policy was the basis for a contextualized approach– not vice versa. The policy’s standards provided the goals that the pathway was designed to reach. Respecting the pre-eminence of the policy made WinS politically tenable. Developing policy and standards were the DoE's mandate and commitment. The approach was UNICEF’s and GIZ’s tool. The Philippines WinS Three Star Approach was designed to abide by and serve government standards and goals, not the other way around.

2. “Piloting at scale.” To determine how a mechanism or instrument such as the three star approach would work when scaled up nationwide, the piloting at some point has to subject it to the rigours of the system. This means that the pilot demonstrates how the mechanism works at different levels of the institution (regional, division or school). It should also test how different parts of the institution take up or respond to the application of the mechanism. This entails that the sample of target schools should be large enough to test how the system would work. Thus, with UNICEF support, the three star approach used in Haiyan/Yolanda recovery involved two regions – with around 7,000 schools total coverage – and mobilization of various concerned units, to contribute according to their respective mandate. 

3. Bringing sub-national to national, in person. Development of the Philippines ’three star approach benefited greatly from the implementation experience in two regions post-Yolanda. Bringing that experience to national attention went beyond research to presenting the narratives to the DoE Central Office. In addition to supporting local activities by regional education departments, UNICEF allocated funds for representatives from these regions to travel to and from Manila for technical working group meetings to develop WinS implementing mechanisms. Those involved in sub-national implementation participated, in person, in national-level discussions, and their participation was characterized by valuable observations and insights. They were able to process their experience in ways that may not have been significant at the regional level, but were very relevant to the national scale-up.

Eventually, although UNICEF funding still remained, DoE regional offices decided to use their own funds to participate in the national discussions. The opportunity for them to participate had transformed into responsibility for contributing to a larger movement. The WinS movement benefited invaluably from personal participation by regional DoE staff.

Moving forward, UNICEF plans focus on modelling to address remaining programming implementation gaps and strengthen the integration of WinS into national systems, including disaster risk reduction and emergency response, and leveraging investments at the sub-national level.

EAPR,Thailand,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
As the UNICEF Thailand Country Programme 2017-2021 approaches its half-way mark, the country office gathered evidence to guide and inform the mid-term review with partners in the first half of 2019. The following lessons learned and challenges arise in general from 2017-2018, particularly where the theories of change and corresponding results logic in the results frameworks required adjustment.

In 2018, constraints and lessons learned included: 
    - The lack of clear inter-ministerial mandates and responsibilities in the Government somewhat hampered progress on adolescents, child protection and social protection; 
    - With the absence of a medium-term expenditure framework for early childhood development, provinces could not plan or secure multi-year funding for early childhood development; 
     - A high turnover of senior officers among UNICEF’s direct partners made it difficult to develop a long-term vision of, and policy reform for, mother tongue-based bilingual education; and challenged cooperation of a shared vision for child protection and social protection;
     - There is the need to review and make recommendations for the programme strategy of demonstration models to inform prioritization, strategic investment and scale-up, and to build synergy across sectors in the second half of the country programme;
     - There is a need to review criteria and potential synergies of the country programme’s geographical targeting; 
There were difficulties in translating policy into practice at the community level, such as the issues around migrant access to education;
   - There is an emerging need to address adolescent skills for employment; especially relevant as the economy will rely on today’s adolescents, given the demographic’s of Thailand’s aging population.

On the social policy planning and budgeting area of early childhood development, 70 provinces (out of 77) developed and received approval for early childhood development plans and budgets for the first time. The lessons learned from this exercise were documented to inform the full institutionalization of provincial early childhood development plans and budgets in Thailand. The analysis revealed a lack of a medium-term expenditure framework for early childhood development, however. Without this budgeting framework, provinces cannot plan for or secure multi-year funding for early childhood development. The operation of the new early childhood development act and the national early childhood development strategy will not be possible without medium- to long-term planning and the associated budget. UNICEF established a partnership with the Government Office of the Public-Sector Development Commission and Oxford Public Management to support the Government in 2019 to address this challenge.

In terms of social protection, UNICEF Thailand’s advocacy to expand the child support grant at technical, public and senior decision-making levels was successful in 2018, ensuring the Cabinet’s commitment to expand the policy to children under six years old. The policy design regarding universality versus targeted was postponed to early 2019. Addressing the inefficiencies in the social-protection sector was challenging, primarily due to a lack of clear leadership and mandate from a single ministry. The country office approached different entities with partial mandates on social protection schemes to prepare the base for a diagnostic review of social protection to be led by the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security in 2019. Despite its new leadership role, the compartmentalized leadership of individual child-sensitive social protection schemes (within and across the Government ministries) results in weak coordination. UNICEF plans to strengthen the capacity of the high-level committee on children to play a stronger role in coordination and monitoring of all such schemes.

In terms of quality of education, UNICEF Thailand prioritized the documentation of a UNICEF-supported mother tongue-based education model in the southern provinces, which was published and launched at the Ministry of Education in September 2018. The research showed a clear advantage for children who study in their mother tongue in the early grades. Taking the model to scale, however, is challenged by a lack of consensus among policy-makers especially at the central level. Language is a barrier to learning for children who do not speak Thai as their mother tongue, with an absence of national strategies to support their specific learning needs. However, according to the study, only 13 per cent of central level decision-makers strongly agree that children should have access to early learning programmes in their mother tongue. The figure for the provincial level is 32 per cent and for the sub-provincial level 44 per cent. UNICEF Thailand will need to focus resources to disseminate the results of introducing a mother tongue-based education across the country. A challenge to this advocacy is the turnover rate of senior officers in the Ministry of Education, which hinders long-term vision and policy reform.

In terms of access to education, a challenge remains to scale up access to education for children from migrant families in Thailand. The issue is a growing priority for the Government, as there are several hundred thousand migrant children who are out of school. The current policy guarantees free education for all children in Thailand. However, the draft Education Act is not as explicit in this regard and UNICEF is advocating for its explicit inclusion in the legislation. Gaps between policy and practice remain, with bottlenecks including indirect costs, language barriers, social attitudes and discrimination, and the availability of essential information to schools and families.

An emerging challenge is supporting education and skills for adolescents: there is a high drop-out rate in Thailand after the last compulsory grade 9 (71 per cent attendance rate for 17year-olds); low PISA scores (Thailand ranks fourth out five ASEAN participating countries); decreasing PISA scores between 2012 and 2015; and a high level of functional illiteracy (32 per cent of 15 year-old students).

A child protection challenge is the system’s limitation to deliver effective case management that links children at the community level with services at the provincial level. The Ministry of Social Development and Human Security holds the mandate for child protection but has no presence below the provincial level. The prevention, identification, referral and service response to cases of violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation at the district and sub-district administration levels is poorly resourced with unclear mandates and coordination. Currently, the number of child protection, or social worker, personnel is insufficient to prevent, detect and respond to child protection risks. UNICEF’s efforts to strengthen the capacity of Ministry of Social Development and Human Security at provincial level, and to strengthen capacity of sub-district level authorities in case management, have not yet resulted in a sustainable model. A lesson learned was that the roles of other ministries, especially Ministry of Interior for local authorities, need to be clarified and institutionalized for an effective system. The revision of the 2013 Child Protection Act currently underway is an opportunity to achieve progress, particularly on the role of local government. 

Information management is a factor limiting analysis of the situation in communities and the Government’s ability to track child protection cases. While a standard case record form was introduced to all sub-districts, the child protection baseline assessment showed that only 31 per cent of sub-districts surveyed had written case records. An evaluation is planned for the first quarter of 2019 to draw lessons learned from the first half of the country programme and inform the mid-term review for this core programme priority. UNICEF is also drawing on international experience and expertise to develop options for the case management system in Thailand. Options include extending the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security professional presence to lower administrative levels, strengthening other line ministries with a district and sub-district level presence to deliver on child protection, further leveraging government volunteers at community level, and increasing effective outreach and services through outsourcing to civil society and the private sector.

In terms of partnerships, a challenge of 2018 was the fragmentation of the programme across government departments, both between different line ministries and within different ministry departments. The fragmentation sometimes prevents UNICEF from harnessing opportunities for synergy, especially across different programme areas. A lesson learned from 2018 was the lack of integration of civil society partnerships into the corresponding government workplans,for coherence and coordination in programme areas with complementing implementing partners from both Government and civil society. In planning for 2019, UNICEF Thailand fully included civil society partnerships in the relevant government workplans for the common programme areas.

In 2018, UNICEF continued to prioritize engagement with the private sector to protect and promote children’s rights. A challenge in engaging the private sector strategically was the development of clear priorities and identification of the space for shared-value partnerships based on programme priorities, UNICEF core assets and the core businesses of companies. UNICEF Thailand is planning an analysis and corporate engagement strategy for the first quarter of 2019 to address this challenge. On the corporate side, although many in the business sector are informed and committed to protect and promote the rights of children in Thailand, the sustainability approach of business at-large remains weak on their assessment, reporting and proactiveness towards the fulfilment of child rights. Moreover, the concept of protecting and promoting child rights needs to be explicitly emphasized in the broader human rights and SDG agendas with business. Where this is not the case, the broader agendas do not focus sufficiently on children and at times can, in fact, compete for the space and attention of the corporate sector. UNICEF Thailand’s strategy was to shift focus to develop strategic partnerships directly with The Stock Exchange of Thailand and the Global Compact Network for Thailand as these entities can amplify this message and integrate it into sustainability frameworks.

Securing advocacy partners, when done right, could open doors for engagement. In 2018, UNICEF Thailand deviated from its traditional circle of partners by bringing artists on board through ‘Art for the Future’ as part of the 70th anniversary campaign. It was the first time for UNICEF Thailand to join with partners such as artists, and the campaign’s execution was adjusted and corrected as the campaign progressed. The new concept proved successful, delivering a powerful message in an innovative and edgy manner through art, and creating partnerships traditionally unfamiliar to the organization. It was a valuable exercise that will guide future advocacy and partnership efforts. A challenge remains to engage those reached by the campaign, in a way to galvanize public support into action and change. 

The visible, innovative and successful campaigns in 2018 demonstrated the impact that can be achieved with a clear definition of a ‘supporter engagement journey’ which, in turn, can inform the design of mechanisms and campaigns to achieve the intended engagement journey and objectives. 

UNICEF Thailand faced challenges in implementing the costed evaluation plan developed in 2016, as some planned evaluations no longer corresponded to programmatic priorities. As a result, the country office updated its costed evaluation plan in 2018 to ensure that evaluations will provide the necessary information for decision-making strategically.

To conclude, UNICEF Thailand will take forward the lessons learned and challenges that emerged in the first two years of country programme implementation to inform the mid-term review in the first half of 2019. The mid-term review will include partners from Government, civil society and the private sector as well as other stakeholders, including children and young people. The process will inform the priorities, future actions and any corresponding revision to the programme and related strategies for 2020-2021 to ensure theories of change and corresponding results logic in the results frameworks are an adequate basis for impactful programming.

EAPR,Timor-Leste,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Lessons learned and constraints

After the elections in mid-2017 resulted in a minority coalition that was unable to pass a Government programme and budget, the Parliament was dissolved in January 2018. New Parliamentary elections were held in May, with a coalition of three parties wining an outright majority. In June 2018, the Government was formally sworn in, but several ministerial posts, including for the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Finance, were still not approved by the President at the end of the year. The 2018 budget was formally approved on 27 September. 

This series of events resulted in extensive government leadership turn-over, shifting priorities, a lack of government budget and an inability to move forward in key policy areas. Significant uncertainly remains, as the 2019 budget has yet to be approved, and if delayed or rejected, the coming year could see additional changes and challenges. 

The unstable and rapidly-changing political and institutional changes that took place in 2018 created several challenges to UNICEF Timor-Leste’s programming. Finalization of workplans were delayed, as without an approved programme and budget, the interim Government was unable to fund new programmes or move forward additional policy initiatives. The new government leadership also needed to be appraised on UNICEF programmes and partnerships. 

While challenging, the continuity of UNICEF Timor-Leste programmes and partnerships was maintained in most programme areas, through close cooperation and strong engagement of ministries at technical levels. Detailed planning, continuous dialogue and joint decision-making with Government and the regular assessment and review of programmes and partnerships were critical in the achievement of results. These strong relationships, built over years, allowed UNICEF Timor-Leste and technical staff within ministries to provide detailed briefings, updates and description of programme strategies, progress and plans to new ministry leadership, ensuring a continuation of programming, particularly for activities at municipal and community level. However, progress at the policy level was seriously hindered across programmes and ministries, as new policies could not be put forward under the interim Government, and the new administration was focused on establishing its structures and advancing its agenda. 

A priority for UNICEF Timor-Leste in 2018 was to strengthen advocacy, external communications and partnerships, with various innovative initiatives developed and implemented in 2018, in line with the Global Cause Framework and in the context of the country programme. These included the launch of the UNICEF Café series and the Journal of Change – highlighting important results and progress achieved with UNICEF support in 2017. Throughout the year, a range of advocacy tools (photos, videos, stories, publications, events) were developed, contributing to the improved reach and efficacy of advocacy and fundraising initiatives. A lesson learned was the need for a full set of materials and tools that can meet various advocacy requirements and reach different target audiences.

Advocacy around early childhood development and Ending Violence Against Children resulted in expanded partnerships with the National Parliament, Rotary Club and private media. A successful initiative developed and launched in 2018 was the UNICEF Café, where participants from various backgrounds came together to discuss critical aspects of early childhood development through collective learning and dialogue, resulting in the engagement of new stakeholders and the development of new partnerships. UNICEF Café themes in 2018 included Father’s Day, breastfeeding and Baby Talk for Dads. The Café was recognized as a global good practice. 

The sustainability of UNICEF-supported programmes, within a context of limited government resources and human resource capacities remained a challenge. With Independence restored in 2002, Timor-Leste has rapidly rebuilt its infrastructure, institutions and systems, developed policies and legal frameworks and rapidly expanded access to services. Capacity development, in many cases, has lagged behind the rapid scaling-up of government policies, programmes and services. In this environment, UNICEF Timor-Leste has placed a high value on capacity building and system strengthening to improve the quality, continuity and sustainability of programmes and services for children. 

Given the ongoing fragility in Timor-Leste, the importance of systematic monitoring of UNICEF-supported programmes to routinely gauge progress toward achievement of planned outputs and outcomes and to ensure national and local level investment and capacities support sustainability, has become increasingly evident. In 2018, programme monitoring found challenges in the application of new knowledge and skills provided through training, insufficient government and community ownership and maintenance of supported infrastructure (schools, water systems, sanitation facilities) and concerns in the viability and sustainability of community support mechanisms such as mother support groups, parent teacher associations, and community animators. A more systematic and partnership-based approach to programme monitoring is needed, taking advantage of innovative technology and participatory approaches. In 2018, tablet-based real-time monitoring of community preschools, engagement of beneficiaries in all stages of the evaluation of the country’s Youth Parliament and joint monitoring with Government and partners of nutrition programmes, confirmed the importance of strong programme monitoring, including engagement of young people, and the potential for improvements in this area for 2019. 

UNICEF Timor-Leste’s programme is primarily dependent on voluntary funding (Other Resources/OR). In addition to funding from UNICEF National Committees in Australia, Japan, Korea and New Zealand, the timely provision of UNICEF global thematic funding has been critical in complementing OR funds throughout UNICEF programmes. In the years to come, attracting more predictable, multi-year and unearmarked funding will be critical to building a balanced and strategic country programme portfolio.

The theories of change and results frameworks remained relevant to guide programme delivery, as the programmes continue to address the most pressing challenges faced by children in Timor-Leste. The Annual Management Plan provided clearly articulated priorities and strategies and the means for effective and efficient programme monitoring and biannual reviews. 

Cross-cutting strategies

Cross-cutting strategies are utilized by UNICEF Timor-Leste, and in many cases are executed concurrently to achieve the best results for children. Programming for results at scale is at the core of Timor-Leste programming, combining efforts for better integration of programmes; increased cooperation and strengthening of partnerships; capacity building at all levels (policy, management, service delivery); and improved service quality and demand creation at community level. Combined, these elements greatly determine the success of programmes and their potential for scale-up. As systems and services are being built and strengthened simultaneously in Timor-Leste, the scaling up of UNICEF-supported programmes are considered throughout the design, delivery, monitoring, and evaluation of programmes.

In order to support programme success and scale up, advocacy, partnerships and participation are used to win support for the cause of children and to mobilize people, resources and commitment to achieving results for children. Closely linked to advocacy and partnerships is the use of evidence to drive change. The combination of global evidence and good practices, local evidence on what works, and research to identify and test new solutions and approaches, contributes towards quality programme design and strategy formulation. Strong monitoring and evaluation, including the valuable participation of beneficiaries and end-users, feeds back into programmes to make them stronger, more contextualized and more able to adapt to changes as required. 

Bringing together the strengths and resources of different UN agencies provides an opportunity for greater success and impact on Timor-Leste’s development. Working well together is especially crucial in areas that cut across UN agency mandates, such as adolescents and youth, nutrition, gender and human rights.

Strategies with the potential for greater investment in time and resources include harnessing the power of business and markets for children and fostering innovation. While the private sector in Timor-Leste is small, working with it and with business leaders provides an opportunity to harness business’s networks and capacities for driving change and developing innovative and effective solutions. The use of innovative means for communicating, monitoring programmes and harnessing the voice and power of children and adolescents is essential and will continue to be prioritized. 

Looking forward

Drawing on lessons learned and emerging opportunities, UNICEF Timor-Leste will focus on five critical and interconnected strategies to drive the development of the new Country Programme (2021-2025) and improve results for children: (1) expanding and strengthening partnerships – internationally and with development partners at national and local levels; (2) working with Government and partners toward scale and sustainability of programmes; (3) linking evidence and advocacy; (4) broadening participation; and (5) improving the quality of systems and services. 

Partnerships will continue to drive UNICEF Timor-Leste programming. Strong partnerships with Government, from national to local level, will ensure alignment with their priorities and contribute to sustained results for children. UNICEF Timor-Leste and Government will also work closely to achieve broad coordination of sectoral areas, such as education, WASH, nutrition and child protection. At community level, programmes and partnerships will be strengthened by supporting communities to guide local development and engaging families in applying positive child-rearing practices. Partnerships with other UN agencies and development partners will build on the strengths and resources of different agencies to pursue opportunities for cooperation and joint programming. Special attention will be placed on strengthening partnerships around nutrition, safe cities, adolescents and youth, health system strengthening and on the development of the education sector plan. Partnerships will also be expanded with international academic institutions, international NGOs and local CSOs. The private sector will be brought in as a vital partner in addressing adolescent and youth issues, and for sharing best practices and investing in education and ECD. Partnerships with media, including television, radio and print media, will continue to be developed, seeking new and innovate ways to advocate for and engage the public in children’s issues. 

A focus on sustainability and scale-up of programmes and services for children and families is essential, as the current country programme nears completion. Strong evidence generation on what works and what doesn’t will guide programme adaptation and implementation and will ensure that what is taken to scale is appropriate and sustainable. The costing of programmes will provide the necessary information to Government and partners regarding the investments needed to scale and sustain results for children. Advocacy for increased financial commitments from the Government will aim to create the fiscal space for improving access to and quality of services, especially for vulnerable groups and those living in rural and remote communities. UNICEF Timor-Leste will also work with development partners and UN agencies to support the Government in setting clear targets and strategies for achieving the SDGs and leaving no one behind. 

Significant and substantive engagement at both the upstream and downstream levels provides UNICEF the opportunity to conduct research and data analysis, monitor policy and programme implementation at local level, and to feedback to Government and partners on what works, who is not being reached and what corrective courses are needed. Empirical evidence of change within communities and improved results for children will be used to develop a compelling case for investment and improved programming for children. Evidence generation and documentation of local experiences will be linked to strong advocacy and communication messaging aimed at leaders, decision-makers, service providers and caregivers. Advocacy channels will include the use of mass media, social media and publications, as well as content development - including video, voice and images. Importantly, advocacy and the sharing of evidence will involve service providers and programme beneficiaries to reinforce quality service delivery, utilization of services and positive child development practices. 

Working in a country with one of the youngest populations in the world, UNICEF Timor-Leste will increase its support to the development of national strategies and programmes for adolescents, ensuring their strong participation and engagement. This is aligned with Government and partner priorities and has enormous potential for going to scale. UNICEF Timor-Leste will work to expand the participation, engagement and contribution of community leaders, parents and caregivers and adolescents in dialogue, solution development and action to address issues such as teenage pregnancy, health and nutrition, safe use of social media, safe spaces and life skills. 

As access to services continue to increase, through Government and partner investments, the equity and quality of these services and the results achieved will be prioritized. UNICEF will continue to focus many of its interventions in the hardest-to-reach populations, and expand its programming for vulnerable groups, such as children with disabilities and children affected by violence, abuse and neglect. Services will be improved through capacity building and systems strengthening, considering lessons learned and the local context. Continual quality improvement approaches will focus on improving the performance of health services at facility level, in partnership with other UN agencies and development partners. In education, UNICEF Timor-Leste will work with Government and partners in measuring learning outcomes, to better identify subject areas and populations requiring additional support. Across programmes, improved programme monitoring and information sharing will allow for regular review and adjustment of interventions, to ensure service quality improvement efforts are successful and replicable. 

UNICEF is well positioned to support Timor-Leste in achieving its national development goals and the Sustainable Development Goals. Partnerships will provide the foundation for improving results for children, supported by joint efforts toward sustainability and scale, evidence generation and advocacy, increased and more meaningful participation, and a commitment to quality services.

EAPR,Vietnam,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
2018 was a critical year for the 2017-2021 Country Programme, as it became fully operational after a long period of delays in gaining approval for project plans and documents required under Viet Nam's overseas development assistance management framework. By mid-year, 15 out of 16 projects were approved and being implemented. The year saw some important breakthroughs, such as the Government decision to scale-up a UNICEF-supported model of Family and Juvenile Courts, and a stepped-up partnership with the National Assembly at the highest level. Nevertheless, uncertainty caused by the government reform processes affected the implementation of numerous activities. This was mitigated to the degree possible and resulted in some important lessons learned.

Government civil servant and structural reform 

In 2018, the Communist Party of Viet Nam and the Government of Viet Nam acted decisively in setting a 10 per cent reduction target for the civil servant personnel headcount by 2020 across all Government agencies. The Party also directed government organizations to lighten their apparatus by reducing the number of departments and leadership positions. These decisions, while expected to reduce public budget spending and improve Government’s efficiency, may also negatively affect social services delivery and lead to interruption in work processes, disproportionally impacting poorer areas. These changes also created some uncertainties and vacancies in certain Government functions, causing delays in decision-making and approval, including of project documents, work plans and project technical papers. 

UNICEF took a proactive action to overcome this challenge and in doing so, learned a number of lessons: 
1. It is important for UNICEF and partners to have a shared and clear understanding of the Government policy, motivation, process, key stakeholders and drivers behind these major reforms. UNICEF raised concerns related to these reforms with the World Bank in the context of the Public Expenditure Review discussion, including potential implications on poor families. The 2018 United Nations Country Team 2018 end of year report also highlighted these issues, due to inputs from UNICEF. 

2. UNICEF, through close partnership with key line ministries, generated evidence, and feedback from the sub-national level and conveyed to the national level the constraints and implications of the reforms. During a UNICEF-facilitated subnational work planning meeting on SDGs, provincial departments raised and discussed the impact of the reforms on their localities. They provided constructive and balanced feedback to the national level, and subsequently, via the Ministry of Education and Training, to the National Assembly. This experience reinforced the importance of listening carefully to local partners and strategically advocating upwards based on local realities. 

3. To overcome the delays and uncertainty caused by the reforms, UNICEF maximized long-term partnerships with leading government agencies, for example, the Ministry of Planning and Investment and the Office of the Government, to leverage their support for acceleration of approval and decision making for UNICEF-related documents. These partnerships will remain critical going forward, as the reform process continues to deepen. 

4. The constrained fiscal environment is also pushing UNICEF to revisit social policy and public financial management priorities across all sectors, in order to be better aligned with the current realities, as well as the needs and interests of the Government. In particular, UNICEF’s agenda should consider the potential impacts on children and the most disadvantaged populations. 

Establishment of Family and Juvenile Courts 

In 2018, Viet Nam launched its second specialist children's court, the Dong Thap Family and Juvenile Court. The court will better protect and serve children through its dedicated children’s judges and court staff and its child-and-gender-responsive procedures, allowing children and their families to participate more fully in judicial proceedings. The first Family and Juvenile Court was launched in Ho Chi Minh City in 2016. Late in 2018, the Chief Justice of the Supreme People’s Court announced that Family and Juvenile Courts would be established in 36 other provinces and subsequently nationwide. 

The creation and scale-up of these children’s courts represents over 10 years of UNICEF work. UNICEF adopted and pursued a long-term strategy, flexible enough to change to fit the evolving context, which included: high-level legal and policy advocacy with the Communist Party of Viet Nam, Courts, Government and the National Assembly; study visits to leading children’s courts; conducting research on justice for children, including a feasibility study; capacity building efforts with justice actors on child-and-gender responsive processes and procedures; evidence-gathering from the Ho Chi Minh City Court, and; and comprehensive legal reform. 

This achievement demonstrated the importance of a long-term and multi-pronged approach that incorporates legal and policy advocacy, capacity building, evidence generation, and modelling innovative approaches, both in-country and through inter-country exchanges. Key lessons learnt included: 

Being prepared to seize opportunities that aligned with UNICEF advocacy. The first attempt to include a provision for a specialist children's court into the Law on Protection, Education and Care of Children of 2004 was not successful. Although this law directly affected the provision of child justice, in the Vietnamese context a more appropriate avenue for advocacy for a children's court was via judicial reform. In 2005, such an opportunity arose with the launch of the comprehensive legal and judicial reforms for the period 2005-2020 by the Viet Nam Communist Party, with court reform at the centre of this process. UNICEF seized the opportunity to advocate for the introduction of specialist children’s court in the reform of the Law on People’s Court Organization. 

UNICEF’s best practice modelling with the first two Family and Juvenile Courts created evidence to advocate for national scale-up of the courts. 2018 saw an upswing in national attention to all forms of violence against children spurring the National Assembly to hold a special session calling on Government and state agencies to report on their actions to address violence against children. UNICEF’s best practice modelling enabled the Supreme People’s Court to highlight the child-friendly and gender-responsive approaches within the children’s court as an important response measure and publicly committed to national scale up. 

Locating children’s issues within the broader country context, UNICEF Viet Nam linked its work for the creation of a special court for children to the ongoing national legal and judicial reform program and harnessed the opportunity presented by the reform of the Constitution in 2013. The creation of the Family and Juvenile Court become a central part of Viet Nam’s legal and judicial reform package, whilst the reform of the Constitution provided a strong rationale and motivation to Viet Nam to establish a children’s court to fulfil the new constitutional provisions on human rights, including children’s rights.  

UNICEF 'localised' the evidence used to advocate for the courts based on the main parameters used in official decision-making in Viet Nam. The focus was on the degree of need, values, costs and the availability of resources to create a sufficient basis to successfully bring about the court. 

Ensuring Government ownership and leadership, especially building the capacity of a core group of ‘thought leaders’, was critical for success. 

Working with the private sector

Viet Nam continued to experience strong economic growth and foreign direct investment. In this context UNICEF increased its engagement with the private sector to minimise the negative impacts and maximise the positive impacts of the private sector on children. UNICEF focuses on the footwear and apparel industry, which are in the top 10 export industries of the country. Through collaboration with Viet Nam Chamber of Commerce and Industry, strategic corporate partners, brands and pilot factories, UNICEF is implementing a Factory Programme to better understand the industry’s impacts, identify win-win solutions and encourage the factories to initiate actions aimed at improving the well-being of working parents and their children. 

A key lesson learned during the implementation of the factory programme in 2018 was that factories are familiar with one-off engagement with non-government organizations. This is mainly funded by brands, where the factories normally allocate time for their workers or management to undergo training on workplace issues. However, long-term engagement which requires the allocation of resources and the introduction of changes in the workplace, was more challenging. For successful engagement, a case for investment needs to be made and senior management buy-in is crucial. Developing investment cases requires dedicated and disaggregated research and evidence-gathering.

Lessons learned and constraints

A slow-down in programme implementation this year was a consequence of the re-organization of central Government following the parliamentary elections of summer 2017. This transient climate is expected to continue for a short while: in December, there was another cabinet reshuffle in which, among others, the Minister of Education, Sports and Youth, Minister of Finance and Economy, and Deputy Prime Minister, who have direct influence on UNICEF programmatic activities, were replaced. 

In recognition of the strong drive towards EU accession, throughout 2018 UNICEF continued to support the Government in moving forward reforms in the areas of justice, social policy, education, health and statistics. The main focus was to progressively align national legislation, policies and action plans with EU accession priorities and the 2030 Agenda.

Data gaps remained a critical barrier to assessment of the extent to which these new laws and policies have been implemented, and, most importantly, if progress has been achieved in the realization of rights. There is a lack of availability and use of data, especially concerning vulnerable groups in the population, as well as at the sub-national level. 

In addition, the low budget allocation for health, education, child protection and social care is a determining factor for success of reforms in these areas and for Albania to reach the standards of the EU and other countries in the region. The ongoing student protests demanding an increase in the budget for education is indicative of the widespread awareness of under-financing of key social services in the country.

The strengthening of capacities of municipalities to plan, deliver and monitor services for children as required by their new mandates remains central to the reform agenda. Throughout 2018, UNICEF engaged in identifying and proposing solutions to address key bottlenecks regarding the lack of coordination and defined accountabilities, missing financial investments, and low workforce capacities. As a positive example, UNICEF is supporting the municipalities not only to develop social care plans, but also to cost them and make proper analysis of the local budgets to finances such plans. Four municipalities have successfully approved and budgeted a three-year social care plan. Interventions at local level have been complemented with UNICEF’s parallel efforts at central level to find solutions for sustainable financing of social care services. A feasible financial mechanism was proposed where funds from the central social protection budget are channelled to local government to support the social care plans. The experience gained indicated that stronger coordination between central and local government is needed to ensure municipalities receive adequate support for implementation of the new laws. Cross-sectoral initiatives around disability, juvenile justice, de-institutionalisation and decentralisation require strengthened multidisciplinary planning and coordination.

The Child Protection Units and the Needs Assessment and Referral Units are two mechanisms introduced at the municipal level and constitute key positive developments for the child protection and social care systems. In order to ensure that vulnerable families and children receive effective support and that the services are delivered in an integrated manner these structures need to be fully established nationwide. Under the new Law on Child Rights and Protection, the minimum requirement is for one child protection worker in every municipality and administrative unit with more than 3,000 children. However, there are currently only 223 child protection workers in Albania, of whom only 45 are hired full-time, and 78 have a background in social work. The existence of adequate capacities of the workforce is a key challenge that requires a dual approach of strengthening the academic preparation for new cohorts of social workers and the provision of on-the-job training programmes for current staff to obtain the skills and competences to deliver on the new standards. 

Even though Albania boasts a relatively well-developed set of laws governing the sector policy and service delivery for all children, limited mechanisms are in place to align multi-sector policymaking to promote holistic development of children younger than six years. An institutional anchor to coordinate early childhood development across sectors does not yet exist, and there is a lack of definition of responsibilities between central and local level, following the decentralisation reform process. While the reform has given increased powers to municipalities to plan and administer pre-school services, this process has not been accompanied with the needed financial transfers and mechanisms for implementation.

In 2018, UNICEF Albania committed to supporting the Municipality of Korca in designing a municipal framework for a child-friendly city, aligned with the UNICEF Global Framework. This work, to be continued in 2019, could become an entry point for introducing a more cross-sectoral perceptive in planning and delivering services for children at the local level.

With regard to justice for children, a steady reduction in the number of children deprived of their liberty was recorded, along with a gradual acknowledgement of the rehabilitative philosophy in criminal justice for children introduced by the new Code on Criminal Justice for Children. Interventions were guided by the results of a Multi-Country Evaluation of the Impact of Juvenile Justice System Reforms, which identified determinants for a successful approach to interventions in this field, demonstrating the importance of evidence-based programming. 

In 2018, UNICEF expanded its child protection programme to address the risk of exposure to violence by children using the internet. As an emerging issue of child protection, a lack of knowledge on this subject and lack of capacities of professionals have been key constraints in implementation. To fill the gap, UNICEF invested in generating knowledge and evidence about children's rights in the digital environment and is spearheading work in this area in both the country and region. 

For the legislative and policy reforms to have a lasting positive impact on children’s lives, the scope should be taken further and be used to generate a shift in perception in Albanian society. In such a context, not only policy makers but also the wider community and particularly professionals working with children - teachers, doctors, law enforcement officials and social workers – would view children as individual right holders and empower them and their families to claim their rights. To this end, public dialogue on child rights, awareness-raising, and dissemination of information concerning the CRC and child rights-related domestic legislation are needed. 

The Government’s process of reporting to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has been a positive step in this regard. It has evolved into a vibrant national process, encompassing diverse actors within Government, civil society, inter-governmental organizations, and children themselves. UNICEF used the reporting process as an instrument to foster awareness and understanding of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, its optional protocols, and the Concluding Observation of the Committee to 1) stimulate a constructive dialogue among various state institutions on child rights issues; 2) encourage an accord on ways to use common statistical data and indicators to assess the situation of children; and 3) reinforce UNICEF’s relations with government, NGOs and children, and strengthen its position as a leader in advocating for a participatory and transparent process of reporting on the realization of child rights. The momentum of high visibility around child rights issues will be sustained in 2019, with UNICEF advocating for improved implementation and better results in the lives of children. 

Recognizing its unique oversight role over accountability, the Albanian Parliament emerged as an important partner of UNICEF in the strengthening of governance for children. The reactivated group of parliamentarians, the Friends of Children, was vocal in 2018 on behalf of children and accelerated legislative changes that benefit child victims of domestic violence and those at risk of statelessness. The involvement of a dedicated focal point for cooperation with Parliament and the continuous interactions of UNICEF programme specialists with its Members transformed the formal agreement concluded in January 2018 between UNICEF and Parliament into a coordinated and coherent collaboration. Effective parliamentary engagement is a long-term process that needs to be integrated regularly into UNICEF’s programming. 

The leadership changes at the People’s Advocate and the Commissioner for Protection from Discrimination were supported with a renewed commitment of UNICEF for fully-fledged collaboration with these key human rights institutions in monitoring child rights issues, investigating violations and offering a space for dialogue between children and the state. UNICEF advocacy was successful in increasing the budget for the Commissioner for Protection from Discrimination, enabling this institution to implement its mandate with intensified involvement in reported violations. This approach constituted a successful case to be replicated for other entities that struggle to fulfil their mandate due to limited financial resources. The People’s Advocate has similarly become distinctively vocal in addressing policies and processes that threaten children’s well-being. In synergy with UNICEF’s voice and advocacy messages, the People’s Advocate, as a direct accountability mechanism, undertook efforts to fill the gaps in checks and balances and to support child-targeted processes of remedy and reform when things have gone wrong or procedures or policies are inadequate.

The United Nations agencies continued to face challenges in direct cash transfer to government partners through the harmonised approach to cash transfers (HACT). There is need for capacity strengthening of government partners over HACT and enabling UNICEF and other UN agencies to complement the current dominant modality of programme delivery through NGOs or directly sub-contracted expertise with direct cash transfer to Government.

"
ECAR,Armenia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
In 2018, the programming environment in Armenia was marked by major political changes brought about through mass protests in the spring. A change of Government Cabinet was expected from the beginning of the year due to previous Constitutional changes and elections, which created an uncertain environment for policy development. However, after the appointment of the Prime Minister in April, Armenia erupted into peaceful mass protests, bringing the country to a standstill. Finally, in May, the opposition leader was given the mandate to form a new Cabinet where almost all officials were replaced. This required quick and focused action by UNICEF to present its mandate and reaffirm joint commitments with the counterparts. While this was to a significant extent successful and prevented major deterioration of the ongoing reform processes, it was difficult to engage on a longer-term vision given the temporary nature of the Government, whose main task was to prepare for snap elections. The pre-elections campaign marked the end of the year, again hampering some of the programme progress. In this rapidly changing environment, much effort was directed to position UNICEF and keep focus on previously agreed priorities, which was successful. 

During the time of mass protests an issue on the participation of children and adolescents emerged, with strong pressure on UNICEF to take a public position in favour or against. Balancing the participation right and protection from harm was a challenging task, especially in a very polarized environment. UNICEF worked with the Human Rights Defender’s Office and leading child rights organizations to monitor the situation and respond when necessary, with an agreement that a continued debate on the participation of children and adolescents needs to take place in times when risks of misinterpretation are lower. In relation to the civil unrest in Armenia, UNICEF’spreparedness was strengthened internally through the activities of the emergency management team. The Emergency Preparedness Platform and Business Continuity Plan were updated based on lessons learned.

The reporting year revealed again several challenges in child rights coordination and monitoring. These included coordination of data collection, policy and delivery of services between different government agencies in the country. While there are some good examples, such as the cross-sectoral work of the Council of Justice for Children, in most areas coordination is insufficient. Notably, the need for better coordination and coherence in the data collection was evident in the cross-sectoral work on the protection of rights of children with disabilities, identifying and finding solutions for out-of-school children, and early childhood development. 

The role of child rights monitoring and policy coordination on behalf of the Government has been assigned to the National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights, which remained inactive for more than five years. Because the National Commission is led by the MoLSA, focus in the past was mostly on protection issues, failing to reflect all rights. This was also demonstrated in the attempt to draft a new Law on Child Rights in 2017-2018, which was withdrawn primarily because it was seen as prioritizing one set of rights over many others. It’s drafting process will restart in 2019. While UNICEF successfully supported establishing the Child Rights Unit in HRDO and its capacity development, the independent monitoring body has a different role and cannot replace the lack of monitoring and coordination by government bodies. Policy advocacy on child rights monitoring needs to continue with the newly-formed Parliament and Government Cabinet to find a viable solution. 

In 2018, UNICEF led the finalization and launch of the child-focused public expenditure measurement report, and a number of costing, capacity development and evidence generation initiatives on budgeting for children. The knowledge exchange facilitated by UNICEF Argentina enabled a change of perception in measuring public expenditure on children. Having the Argentine Ministry of Treasury representatives directly sharing their expertise and knowledge, including challenges and opportunities, with their counterparts in the Ministry of Finance of Armenia allowed for a shift in understanding and attitude towards the importance of measurement of expenditure on children from the state budget. The exercise mobilized other partners with more experience than UNICEF in public finance management activities, such as the European Union, the German Development Aid agency (GIZ) and the World Bank and allowed for aligned advocacy on the budgeting process. The C-PEM exercise conducted in Armenia was comprehensive, covering national, local, and sectoral budgets and all types of expenditure (direct, indirect, expanded, public goods). However, the complexity of the analysis had a two-fold effect. On the one hand, it generated solid evidence for advocacy, and showcased that such information can be obtained based on existing budgetary and statistical data.On the other hand, its comprehensiveness was an obstacle for full adoption by the Ministry of Finance. A more step-by-step implementation in further institutionalization of C-PEM would be a more desired approach for the Ministry, including intensified work with the methodological department.  

The programme-based budgeting reform implemented in 2018 offered more opportunities to improve budget allocations for children, which was accomplished with UNICEF-provided training and technical support to four line ministries. Working directly with sectoral ministries with which UNICEF has ongoing programme engagement and focusing on budgeting offered greater returns, compared to targeting only the Ministry of Finance. The lesson learned was that budgeting for children initiatives should be advanced from both sides – with the Ministry of Finance as the agency setting the overall financing framework and guidelines and the line ministries as those responsible for programme planning and implementation. Moreover, the Parliament, which has an increased role in Armenia regarding budget oversight, should become a more active stakeholder in UNICEF’s public finance work.

Over the years UNICEF has supported major changes in the society regarding the rights of children with disabilities, combining efforts in changing public attitudes, legislation, policies, capacities and practices on all levels and across sectors. While this was done with modest funds, sustained efforts year after year led to changes in the views of the general public and professionals. In 2018, UNICEF launched a multi-platform public campaign, with support of the National Goodwill Ambassador, which reached over three million individuals through different channels. Policy advocacy was sustained with the MoLSA, MoES, and the MoH tackling, among other issues, the disability assessment model based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. Capacities of professionals were built through facilitated cooperation of the University of Minnesota and Yerevan State Pedagogical University. Direct changes in the lives of children were brought about through the closing of two residential special schools followed by the return of the children to their communities and mainstream schools.  

However, important lessons can be drawn from the progress in the realization of rights and especially inclusive education of children with disabilities. More children with disabilities are attending the Armenian public schools, but so far, few teachers have taken part in quality training to improve specific skills and provide good support to these children in general education classrooms. This shortcoming often leads to either inferior quality education or even to exclusion within the classroom. Thus, the focus on inclusive education should shift from physical presence of children with disabilities in mainstream schools to the quality of learning and development.  

Although the Armenian Government has considered education for teachers a most urgent priority for ensuring equity and quality in access and learning, the existing teacher training programmes offered by the State and different development partners are fragmented and do not necessarily prioritize teaching methodologies and an inclusive learning environment. It is clear that the education system requires stronger support, not only by UNICEF and a limited number of civil society partners. The interest of other significant development partners in the education sector, such as the European Union, the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank,mostly focuses on other aspects of education improvement, such as science and technology education and vocational training. While these are important areas of improvement, attention to inclusiveness is not always present. UNICEF’s efforts should be further directed towards advocacy and leveraging, making sure that all education sector support programmes are disability-sensitive, and consider the requirements of the universal design of the learning materials and environments, in line with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities General Comment no. 4. Armenia will only be able to address the equity gaps in education that children with disabilities continue to face, by bringing together all actors engaged with education in a coordinated manner.

"
ECAR,Azerbaijan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
A repeated element of UNICEF-supported advocacy for children during 2018 was a focus by government partners on understanding the full costs of implementing proposed initiatives in support of child development. Examples included the mandatory flour fortification and the development of a National Plan of Action for Children and the SDGs. In an economic context where efforts continue to balance the national budget and one of the recognized risks to development is potential revenue fluctuations linked to oil prices, it is understandable that investment in child development should be linked to a clear fiscal framework. For this reason, UNICEF prioritized the cost-benefit analysis associated with its advocacy for mandatory flour fortification, resulting in positive engagement among government partners. Similar analyses should be undertaken for future advocacy priorities, not least for those requiring increased public expenditure to bring realisation. Looking ahead, when feasible, UNICEF will now consider the inclusion of sustainability costings in the scope of pilot programmes, so that a focus on the longer-term investments needed to scale-up successful programmes is included from the inception phase.

The establishment of new State entities during the year created opportunities for UNICEF to strengthen engagement for children, acknowledging that priorities for children can be addressed through collaboration with less traditional partners. In this case, UNICEF worked closely with the newly established Azerbaijan Food Safety Agency and the State Agency for Mandatory Health Insurance, to provide technical support on important system reforms and policy development. 

Ensuring longer term sustainability of initiatives for children is recognized as a challenge in any context where there are multiple national priorities. UNICEF addressed this to some extent in Azerbaijan in 2018 through a number of initiatives, including investing support in the capacity of academic institutions leading to the development of the Centre of Excellence for Inclusive Education, the Youth Worker Masters’ degree programme with the Academy of Public Administration under the President, and support for routine refresher training of health professionals through medical universities. This strategy will embed routine capacity strengthening into existing pre-service and in-service training, and hopefully create a continuum of technical capacity amongst professionals in these sectors for many years.

Azerbaijan remains a country where overseas development assistance is not a significant contributor to programmes for children, with the exception of a small number of international donors. UNICEF worked throughout the year to build solid relationships with key international partners - including the European Union and the Government of the Netherlands - to secure additional financial resources to support areas of mutual interest. A key pillar of UNICEF's approach to resource mobilization in Azerbaijan has been to identify where its programme priorities for children best match the broader social development interests of international partners - such as civil society development or gender equity - and demonstrate how these aspirational goals can be effectively translated into practical progress and results through investment in the country programme. At the same time, UNICEF has focused on the non-financial value of partnerships with international supporters, for example, working with the Embassy of Brazil to showcase a Brazilian-made documentary on early childhood development as part of national advocacy efforts, and establishing an activity-based partnership with Rotary International to engage members in sports programming with young people.

Successful programme delivery continued to be reliant upon effective operational support within UNICEF. Efforts were made throughout the year to improve efficiency and effectiveness, including through a major review of processes for contracting with external specialists and consolidating guidance for partners on managing UNICEF's financial support. These reviews were especially designed to include staff working in both programme and operations areas, through small project teams. This has ensured that the resulting changes to processes fully reflect the needs and day-to-day working realities of staff who implement these processes. Efforts also continued to support increased efficiency at a UN Country Team level, with UNICEF operations staff actively engaged in the UN Business Operations Strategy, with one key result being a move towards unified banking services across the UN family in 2019.

As the demands of the country programme continue to grow, so has the recognition of a revised approach to staff professional development to ensure those implementing the programme have the required knowledge and experience to do so. During the year, management and staff worked closely to look at improvements to staff learning opportunities, resulting in the finalization of a staff human development strategy and a staff exchange programme to be implemented from 2019. The latter will enable lower and middle level staff to exchange knowledge and experience with other UNICEF offices in the region.

UNICEF Azerbaijan also benefited from expert guidance and strategic support from the UNICEF Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia, through visits by advisers in a number of sectors. This targeted support, based on clear terms of reference and timed to coincide with, for example, preparations for the Mid-Term Review of the Country Programme, enabled UNICEF Azerbaijan to absorb broader regional experiences and connect its own work with wider priorities at the regional level.

"
ECAR,Belarus,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
UNICEF Belarus learned several lessons from its 2018 programming, as well as insights to the use of change strategies and partnerships, that will guide strategic planning in 2019 and beyond, particularly the design of the 2021-2025 country programme.

Shifting to a child- and adolescent-friendly city platform, with an emphasis on the SDGs, created an opportunity to harmonize local programmes with the global SDG agenda, as well as better align UNICEF Belarus’ programming with national priorities.

A critical process in promoting child rights and policy development is managing the delicate balance between the national and local levels – with the national level setting policy frameworks and guidance, but the local levels implementing service responses and being where families and children live. 

In 2018 UNICEF Belarus made a concerted effort to enhance the former child-friendly city initiative to a broader platform that placed special focus on both adolescent’s unique needs and  the SDG agenda. This platform allowed for increased visibility and advocacy at the regional level and bringing national priorities to the local level, in particular the SDG agenda and adolescent focus. The integration of SDG-related indicators into the CAFC index, used by cities to assess their level of child-friendliness, provided the impetus to focus local administrations on these priorities.

This strategy proved to be effective as Belarus has a strong commitment to the SDG agenda, making UNICEF’s focus strongly in line with national priorities; at the same time the SDG agenda lends itself to UNICEF’s equity agenda. As Belarus has identified the future generation as an accelerator for its SDG achievements, enhanced attention to adolescents also better aligns UNICEF’s programming with national priorities.

In 2019 UNICEF will continue to strengthen this platform with an increased focus on advancing more participatory governance on planning and budgeting with local administrations and adolescents. At the same time UNICEF Belarus will build on local-level SDG dialogue.

Broadening cross-sectoral partnerships served as a key impetus in securing sustainable results. Despite their importance, forging these partnerships proved to be challenging. While stakeholders from all sectors of the society (Government, business and civil society) showed sufficient motivation to work on the child rights issues related to their core agendas, they were less motivated to find common ground and cooperate with other sectors. UNICEF worked to overcome rifts by rallying stakeholders across sectors to work on issues of nationwide concern. For example, bringing together representatives of law enforcement agencies, CSOs and the leading mobile operator to address various aspects of online safety for children, and thereby transforming scattered activities into a concerted effort for the benefit of children.

Ultimately, broadening partnerships with the private sector and with individuals underscored the overall value of the relationships, since opportunities for engagement are as critical as resources. UNICEF Belarus expanded its capacity to develop messages and initiatives that resonate with a larger portion of the population by using private companies’ communications and marketing channels to reach out to wide circles of their customers and other community members. As changing attitudes and behaviours is a critical component of advancing child rights, fostering engagement from different spheres of communities proved to be a strategic intervention.

Greater gender focus on adolescent outreach responses is required to ensure effective support for boys and girls: The UNICEF Belarus review of gender breakdown of its adolescent and youth programming reflected that girls are more involved (70 per cent) than boys (30 per cent). Specifically, adolescent girls had significantly more participation in capacity-building sessions (75 per cent), such as for leadership development and communication skills. Participation in adolescent-led parliaments and engagement in YFHS also involved more girls than boys. In regard to HIV testing and participation in training sessions for adolescents living with HIV, the involvement between boys (55 per cent) and girls (45 per cent) was more balanced. 

In assessing this situation UNICEF Belarus is convinced that the need for such information and interventions is equally important for male and female adolescents. Hence the country office plans to fine-tune its outreach strategies to be more gender sensitive. One solution could be to incorporate S4D components into existing interventions such as YFHS, information outreach and capacity building to attract more boys. 

Change strategies: In a middle-income country UNICEF’s interventions have focused on system change and coordinated partnerships with key stakeholders. UNICEF Belarus has applied many of the eight 2018-2021 Strategic Plan change strategies, finding that several play a major role in advancing UNICEF’s agenda in Belarus. A significant number of interventions focus on programming for at-scale results, frequently complemented by the strategy of harnessing the power of evidence as a driver of change. As Belarus has high capacity and a structured, social-oriented system, UNICEF’s value-added lies in providing strategies that advance innovations and international child rights standards that the country can consider for adaptation to the Belarus context. These strategies have served as tools enabling UNICEF to enter into close partnership with the Government and CSO partners and invest in system strategies and programme adjustments that can be integrated into national systems.

UNICEF Belarus’s expanding partnership agenda also opened up opportunities to build on strategies such as ‘winning support for the cause of children,’‘ developing and leveraging resources and partnerships’ and harnessing the power of business and markets’. These strategies enabled UNICEF Belarus to serve as a convener for expanding dialogues with members of different sectors of society and strengthening their engagement in child rights issues. 

In 2019 UNICEF Belarus will solidify the lessons learned and raise its work to a new level. The growing private sector partnerships represent a tested process for establishing greater engagement – both through leveraging resources and participation by different social actors. Greater efforts will be applied to fostering private partnerships, both to leverage resources and provide a channel for community engagement and activism to protect children’s rights.

At the same UNICEF Belarus will build on its S4D momentum, participating as a key partner in the Second European Games as well as integrating S4D strategies into overall programming strategies, as well as establishing a more long-term legacy for sustainable volunteerism among adolescents and young people. 

With 2019 as the initial year for planning the new programme cycle (2021-2025), UNICEF Belarus will work to prioritize and systematize responses with particular attention to critical opportunities such as justice for children, attention to the second decade and support to children with disabilities. UNICEF Belarus plans to develop a planning process that will invite adolescents’ involvement and feedback on the programme design, as well as active participation by the Government and CSOs.

"
ECAR,Bosnia and Herzegovina,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
The October 2018, general elections affected progress and decision-making across the country, for example with legislative reform in social protection. While RepublikaSrpska implemented the new law on child protection (cash benefits) in January 2018, the new law on financial support to families with children, although approved by the FBiH Government, was not submitted to the Federal Parliament, in view of the elections.  

The election campaign slowed down planning and implementation of many initiatives. For example, just before the elections, the RepublikaSrpska Government decided against participating in the multiple indicator cluster survey, a decision the country office plans to revisit with RepublikaSrpska partners in 2019. Overall, the theories of change and results logic of frameworks remained relevant, but the impact of external events should not be under-estimated (either the general elections or the unanticipated influx of refugees and migrants). In an election year, especially given the complex situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, expectations and plans need to be adjusted. The country will hold municipal elections in 2020.

Another lesson, while not necessarily new, is that implementing at-scale is often difficult in Bosnia and Herzegovina due to the complex system of governance, with many powers devolved to local levels.(Bosnia and Herzegovina has ministers at state-level, two entities, and 10 cantons, totalling over 160, as well as municipal authorities). Although modest progress was achieved in policy changes at state or entity levels, steps were taken in various cantons and municipalities, for example in advancing the social protection and inclusion model, including through municipal budgets, and the roll-out of the secondary prevention programme focused on early identification and mitigation of risk factors among adolescents. Such local level work is often more time and resource intensive as it requires the same level of political analysis and engagement (with communities) as working with state and entity level counterparts, multiplied many times over in order to have results at scale across different administrative areas. Maintaining the appropriate balance, with real-time adjustments as the country-context shifts, will remain a continuous challenge going forward.

UNICEF support in fostering cross-sectoral and multi-sectoral programming was noteworthy in 2018. Government counterparts, multilateral institutions such as the European Union, and bilateral donors recognized the expertise and capacity of UNICEF BiH in advancing the realization of child rights including, for example, UNICEF’s advocacy for social inclusion of children with disabilities; expertise in child protection in the refugees/migrants response, and technical advice provided for policy development and system strengthening at all levels. As the country office designs its new Country Programme Document in 2019-20, cross-sector and multi-sector approaches will remain focus strategies. 

In 2018, direct outreach to young people, parents and communities over social media brought results in terms of reach and also personalised content. For example, the social mobilization ‘champions of inclusion’ campaign invited people across the country to nominate those who contributed to social inclusion of children with disabilities, and reached up to 500,000 people. Also, for the first-ever celebration of Father’s Day in Bosnia and Herzegovina, UNICEF asked fathers to share stories about their engagement in their child’s first 1,000 days of life. Given its success, the country office will increase similar efforts in 2019, including those related to the Convention on the Rights of the Child@30, early childhood development/early childhood interventions, and adolescents.

One important lesson from the refugees and migrant crisis was that BiH still depends on international support to deal with the unexpected. In this case, the situation overwhelmed government systems and challenged complex, decentralized government system with coordination issues. UNICEF had updated its emergency preparedness plans early in the year as part of the new emergency preparedness platform, but the sudden developments required significant additional work. For 2019, the country office is gauging efficient and effective modalities to continue response while keeping momentum on other initiatives. 

Going forward, UNICEF Bosnia and Herzegovina will use lessons learned to inform programmes, including cross-sector interventions. For example, programmes will increasingly involve adolescents and youth, such as through U-Report and PISA, to strengthen collaboration with young people as role models, whether those with a disability, from minority groups in various social mobilization campaigns to advance child rights. Based on the latest evidence and insights, in 2019 UNICEF will develop programme strategy notes, the new Country Programme for 2021-2025, and conduct a gender programmatic review.

ECAR,Bulgaria,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Every child survives and thrives
Better analysis of global and regional trends: It is of paramount importance to analyze global, European and national political trends to discern the impact and power to influence the child rights agenda in Bulgaria. With the Bulgarian Presidency in the European Union helped promote investment in the early years, proving that the child rights’ agenda should be politically supported at the highest levels. 

A less positive experience with the public debate related to the ratification of the Council of Europe’s convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, known as the Istanbul Convention. The ruling of the Bulgarian Constitutional Court (27 July 2018) that the Convention does not conform to the Constitution revealed increasing sensitivities around the definition of gender specifically, and human and child rights. In that regard, UNICEF Bulgaria will more-proactively seek support from the regional office and headquarters communication teams.

Social policy and delivery of results at scale: UNICEF Bulgaria demonstrated its ability to mobilize partners and conceptualize, organizing delivery of innovative services for change in the legislation. However, maintaining the quality of services and delivering results at scale are still challenging. While the Government appreciates UNICEF’s technical experience in conceptualizing and modeling, UNICEF is not sufficiently involved in the national budget discussion and perhaps not seen as the most relevant partner to influence the (re) allocation of funds for children. Some well-designed models of services for children are at risk due to lack of financial projection.  

In 2019, UNICEF will be proactive in delivering cost analysis of models that are not fully owned by the Government, and using this evidence for advocacy. Financial projections should be developed on different scenarios of scaling and related costs, as well as human resource investment and workforce costs to sustain the quality of services.  

UNICEF Bulgaria will continue to support the Government in implementation of the Social Services Act to better regulate all service in the country. In parallel, UNICEF Bulgaria will establish regular contacts and partnership with the Ministry of Finance, and invest in scaling up proven models such as the home-visiting service, the family consultative centres, and for inclusive pre-school education. UNICEF Bulgaria will analyze budgets to suggestion how to fund the models using domestic resources. UNICEF Bulgaria will apply the global programme guidance on public finance for children, looking at adequacy, efficiency, effectiveness, equity and transparency of spending. There will be dialogue with partners to ensure the system’s capacity to continue with interventions for refugee and migrant children, as the number of unaccompanied and separated childrenis increasing despite the overall trend of the total numbers of arrivals decreasing. 

Unfinished business: Despite progress and results in the Child Care Reform that Bulgaria is sharing horizontally, there are still challenges related to availability and quality of services for children with disability and children in contact with the law. Some progress has been noted and documented with inclusive education of children with disabilities, but there is a need for comprehensive, coordinated and multisectoral efforts to ensure that no child is left behind, regardless of their abilities. As immediate steps, a national database on children with disabilities should be strengthened and new approaches for their participation and inclusion in society developed. Also, children in conflict with the law are still retained in closed facilities due to slow progress in the reform of the juvenile justice system and non-existence of alternative measures. UNICEF will advocate in 2019 for accelerating juvenile justice reform and development of alternatives for children in contact with the law.

Every child learns
Cross-sectoral cooperation: One of the main challenges in improving the well-being of children continues to be the lack of cross-sectoral cooperation and coordination between child protection, social protection, education, health and justice sectors both at national and local level. In 2019, UNICEF Bulgaria will support the finalization of the National Strategy for the Child (2019 – 2030) and the National Early Childhood Development Strategy, strategic frameworks for cross-sectoral cooperation, and will continue to develop and improve the mechanisms for cooperation in areas such as prevention of school dropout, prevention and response to violence, prevention of child marriages, juvenile justice and social services provision. The country already has a good model for cross-sectoral mechanism for prevention of the school dropout that can be used as an example.

Every child is protected from violence and exploitation
Prioritization and strategic focus: The main lesson learned is the need to reduce the number of programmatic priorities to focus and maximize the effort to produce the systemic changes and highest impact on life of children in the country. An office compact must be introduced to ensure better synergy and further alignment of the programme, communication and fundraising outcomes. In 2019,the team will select prevention and response to violence against children as the UNICEF Bulgaria priority and integral part of the annual management plan, where further alignments and better synergy between the programme, communication and fundraising will be ensured. 

New partnerships for children: A recent trend in public discourse on traditional values, where the traditional family narrative is used to oppose child rights and children’s protection from violence and abuse, is demonstrating a need to look for new partnerships in order to combine efforts in promoting the child rights agenda. UNICEF will reflect on and strategize how to work with religious institutions. The office will explore opportunities for strategic communication on child rights, including audience research and message testing to support the INSPIRE package promotion and the Bulgarian Government to join the Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children. The global communication and mobilization around the CRC@30 and specific focus on child well-being will develop new partnerships in the country.

Harnessing the power of business and markets for children: UNICEF will invite the private business in the country, creating solutions for children using two themes – violence against children and children with disabilities. UNICEF Bulgaria’s campaign to prevent and address violence in schools is an opportunity to involve new partners and attract supporters.


Every child has an equitable chance in life 
Data collection and data analysis: A significant weakness in Bulgaria is lack of disaggregated data on children, particularly children with disabilities. UNICEF will strengthen effort and reach out to different partners to gather and analyze data on children. This is of utmost importance to ensure quality support in the evidence-based policy development and development of services for children. 

UNICEF’s convener role and partnerships: UNICEF Bulgaria will strengthen its role as convener of child-related meetings and catalyst of the legislative reform processes. UNICEF remains an important technical partner to the Government in assisting child-related policies and technical discussions, such as the national Strategy for the Child and Child Act. In the next phase of policy revision and development, UNICEF Bulgaria will focus on quality of the process and harmonization with all child-related revisions in the legislative framework. A stronger partnership in this process will be steered.

Enhance UNICEF skills in result-based planning and management: With the new staff and new partners, there is a need to strengthen planning and result-based management skills. UNICEF will prioritize this training in the first part of 2019 to ensure delivery of programme results.

ECAR,Croatia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Lessons learned 

The value of UNICEF’s engagement in Croatia and beyond has been widely recognized. UNICEF’s focus, commitment and drive to support the Government of Croatia in delivering results within the unfinished national child rights agenda has resulted in a trusted and fruitful relationship that benefits children and society. This has also resonated with the wider public and the private sector that supports UNICEF’s programmes for children in Croatia and beyond through financial and in-kind resources. 

Intensive joint planning, dialogue and monitoring of agreed activities resulted in strong partnerships that deliver results for children. In 2018, UNICEF intensified cooperation with the Ministry for Demography, Family, Youth and Social Policy (MDFYSP), focusing on families and children at risk of separation. Technical support and capacity building provided by UNICEF, accompanied by continuous dialogue resulted in an improved legislative framework and commitment to de-institutionalisation, with the focus on the youngest children, aged 0-3 years. In partnership with MDFYSP, a broad alliance with civil society organizations and academia was established, with UNICEF in the role of convener and facilitator of joint solutions that bring changes for vulnerable children and their families. Through this collaboration, UNICEF has been recognized as a reliable and strong technical partner, focused on joint delivery of results for the most vulnerable groups of children. 

Important lessons in the implementation of the child-friendly justice programme emerged in 2018. Programme interventions can be significantly enhanced if partners are engaged in joint responses to the programme intervention evaluation. Following a presentation and discussion on the recommendations from the evaluation of the programme on child friendly justice, partners undertook dialogue on the next steps. This resulted in the need for capacity building of judiciary professionals being identified, which was agreed as a joint task of the Ministry of Justice, State Attorney’s Office, Supreme Court and Justice Academy. Building on the positive experience from previous years, UNICEF initiated and supported the curricula for sustainable capacity building programmes that will support the training of judiciary staff for generations.

UNICEF’s responsiveness and flexibility to address new or previously unrecognized issues that were identified during the Annual Review process was another key lesson. As an example, UNICEF followed up on the invitation to engage in providing solutions to the problems of children whose parents are incarcerated. As a result, in 2018 a video visitation system was piloted in the biggest national penitentiary in partnership with the Ministry of Justice. The recommendations from this pilot will lead to scaling-up. With UNICEF’s support, 13 correctional facilities will have the inmate visitation video system and establishment of the family staff model, following training of the prison staff.

Health outcomes for prematurely born children can improve with commitment and action of the Ministry, the wider public, corporates and UNICEF. A network of ambitious and committed partners and experts, convened by UNICEF and the Ministry of Health, led to significant improvements in neonatal intensive care units across the country. UNICEF provided technical support and communication expertise that focused on improving health services for prematurely born children. The results achieved through this partnership, including establishment  of the national human milk bank, has seen Croatia recognised for its efforts by the expert community regionally and globally. 

Social and cultural habits impeding children from opportunities can be changed if community efforts to understand attitudes and practices different from one’s own are combined with actions to include children from minority backgrounds. This was the most important lesson in modelling community support for the inclusion of Roma and non-Roma children living in poverty-stricken settlements into pre-school education in Slavonski Brod. Through partnerships, awareness-raising, capacity building for outreach and the flexibility of local authorities, a pre-school attendance of 100 per cent for Roma children was achieved. 

Intensive collaboration with the Agency for Electronic Media on promotion of media literacy brought an important lesson in parental support to children in learning media literacy skills. If properly supported parents can act as children’s media guardians, however the efforts need to be continued. In addition, UNICEF has been recognized as a trusted partner by many institutions who joined the first Media Literacy Days, a platform built on the idea that a wide partnership will contribute to sustainability and scaling up of media literacy promotion and education for children.

Collaboration with business professionals and leaders led to an important lesson in awareness-raising, capacity and goodwill building. Through various initiatives implemented in the framework of Child Rights and Business, UNICEF succeeded to engage leading national and international companies in Croatia, whose leaders expressed their desire to actively contribute to expansion of corporate social responsibility towards child rights, together with young people. As a result, in 2019, a first due diligence on the impact of business on child rights will take place, paving the way for many others. This initiative also catalysed four corporate alliances that have contributed to the UNICEF Country Programme in Croatia through resources and engagement of customers.

UNICEF demonstrated that evaluations of key programme interventions designed and implemented in Croatia, coupled with the availability of relevant experts, can support the organisation’s technical expertise in other countries. This lesson was gained through work with UNICEF offices in the region who decided to use programme interventions developed in Croatia to address similar challenges in their countries. This was the case for programme interventions that address parenting skills and peer violence in schools that were used by UNICEF Belarus and UNICEF Bulgaria.

UNICEF’s investment in communication with the wider public and donors has resulted in long-lasting support and engagement of new individuals who are willing to support work on behalf of the most vulnerable children. High-profile public events were identified as particularly important in contributing to enhanced engagement.

In 2018, UNICEF Croatia confirmed that increasing the opportunities for children and adolescents to provide opinions and insights has a positive impact on programmes and communication work. Ensuring children participate in the Child Participation Advisory Board and Think Tank on Child Rights and Corporate Social Responsibility has built the belief of children that their opinions matter and are being taken into consideration. 

The Country Programme theories of change were revised during 2018 and the Strategy Notes were refined to reflect new data and insights, emerging priorities and to better align with the Government priorities. A two-year Rolling-out Plan (2018-2019) was signed by all Government partners. Following the revision of the Strategy Notes, the new Office Advocacy Plan for 2018-2019 was prepared, with three programme priorities to focus on. The implementation of the Advocacy Plan provided UNICEF Croatia with renewed and sharpened focus, streamlining advocacy efforts by different parts of the programme. 

The Annual Review Meeting was an opportunity to reinforce collaboration with the Government and to refocus UNICEF Croatia interventions around national priorities. During the Meeting, all Government representatives expressed their appreciation for UNICEF’s support and emphasised the importance of its engagement for the benefit of children in Croatia.

Constraints 

Facilitating joint agreements and multisectoral work between different government bodies requires more time than planned, causing delays in country implementation of the Country Programme. An 11-month delay in the establishment of the Government’s Steering Committee for Early Childhood Intervention was one example of such a constraint that was resolved through increased advocacy efforts of the UNICEF programme team.

Although UNICEF Croatia has made significant improvements in ensuring quality and timeliness in the development of terms of reference and concept notes for research, identification and commissioning of the expert research teams, on occasions the process was constrained due to unsuccessful advertising.

Decentralized financing and management of services for children in the area of pre-school education was a major constraint to achieving at-scale results in early childhood education. The programme team continued advocating with government partners on this topic and worked on jointly finding ways to overcome this constraint as efficiently and innovatively as possible.

More resources are needed to advocate for frameworks and legislation that are conducive to corporate social responsibility and child rights. Only companies that are listed on the stock exchange have a requirement to report on their social responsibility. UNICEF plans to partner with others to advocate for changes that will facilitate a more positive role of business in child rights. 

General Data Policy Regulation (GDPR) enforcement, that took place in May 2018, created limitations for fundraising and communication activities towards individual donors. UNICEF conducted an extensive review of its current practices related to personal data protection with special attention to fundraising activities, introduced additional measures and protocols in order to align its current practices with the GDPR enforcement. In addition, existing corporate partners became reluctant to collaborate on co-mailings due to the GDPR, which has negatively impacted on the contribution from this model of resource mobilization.

The fundraising team engaged with UNICEF Private Fundraising and Partnerships Division and the Regional Office to implement a new model of resource mobilisation, the legacy. UNICEF Croatia will continue to benefit from their support in 2019 to overcome administrative challenges. 

The emigration of Croatian residents has affected UNICEF’s resource mobilization efforts, as many donors stopped regular donations after moving abroad.

In 2018, there were 27 staff members in UNICEF Croatia. One national staff member (the Head of Office) was promoted to an international position and two went on stretch assignments or surge missions. The balance between UNICEF’s needs, the well-deserved ambitions of national staff and the support to the entire organization was maintained in 2018, but places an additional burden on the human resources team and the overall staff workload.

Looking forward 

In 2019, UNICEF Croatia programme implementation will be guided by the revised Strategy Notes. These Notes and the monitoring of progress towards the regional priorities will be key in maintaining the focus on interventions aligned with the UNICEF Strategic Plan and the SDGs.

UNICEF Croatia will implement recommendations from the Gender Programmatic Review process, which was conducted in 2018.

In 2019, a total of five research/surveys will be conducted, including a Situation Analysis on Children in Croatia that will inform next country programme cycle. In addition, two evaluations will be initiated.

The Resource Mobilisation Plan for 2019-2021 was revised at the end of 2018, and UNICEF will continue to implement the strategy with a focus on expanding fundraising activities in the tourism sector and further grow innovative models of private sector fundraising.

In partnership with the Innovation Fund and the UNICEF Regional Office, three applications for assistive communication for global application will be tested.

In 2019, UNICEF Croatia will intensify collaboration with UNICEF Bosnia and Herzegovina, UNICEF Montenegro and UNICEF Serbia under the umbrella of Dialogue for the Future programme, financed through the UN Peacebuilding Fund. Through this collaboration, programme activities benefitting young persons will be expanded.

With support of Headquarters and the Regional Office, the new UNICEF Croatia website will be operationalized in 2019, based on the global website platform.

ECAR,Georgia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Lessons learned

During 2018, evidence-based advocacy and policy dialogue continued to be the most effective change strategy for UNICEF Georgia and strongly influenced public debates and policy changes. Most significantly, the data from UNICEF’s WMS on the increase of child poverty led to a renewed public debate on poverty and intensive internal Government discussions that eventually resulted in the five-fold increase of child benefits. Also, during 2018, the new Minister of Education announced an incremental expansion of the new school model developed in 15 pilot schools within the Estonia-UNICEF-MoESCS partnership to all schools in Georgia over the next five years.  

Furthermore, UNICEF mobilized Government commitment to scale up the new functional disability assessment instrument that is in the process of development and testing. In addition, data published in 2018 showed that UNICEF’s public advocacy and communication for social change campaign #SeeEveryColour contributed, together with the efforts of other stakeholders, to a significant decrease of stigma against persons with disability from 41.5 per cent in 2015 to 28.3 per cent in 2017.

UNICEF’s advocacy efforts during 2018 also showed that social norms are best addressed through integrating communication for social change into government programmes and strategies. In this vein, UNICEF Georgia included a communication for social change component into its work directed at changes in the child protection system. The aim is to enable professionals to become active promoters of social change in their communication with institutions, clients and the broader public. During 2018, UNICEF’s capacity building of over 100 professionals of the social workforce in the Adjara pilot region included sessions enabling participants to rethink and address existing social norms. The outcomes of these efforts was the more active role played by social workforce professionals in a broader communication campaign involving all layers of society, aiming to create a more enabling environment for policy, institutional and social changes. 

The development and leverage of partnerships for children by UNICEF Georgia also showed high effectiveness as a change strategy during 2018. This was demonstrated by the positive impact of the multi-disciplinary cooperation mechanism that guided the implementation of the Juvenile Justice Code and was expanded from central to regional level throughout the country. By fostering partnerships for children with, as well as between central decision makers and regional practitioners from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the General Prosecutors Office, the Ministry of Justice, the Judiciary, the Ministry of Education, Science, Culture and Sport, the Social Service Agency, and the Probation and Penitentiary Departments under the Ministry of Justice, this mechanism contributed effectively to improving the administration of juvenile justice.

Another example for the effectiveness of this change strategy was UNICEF’s increased engagement with municipalities and their social workforce to ensure increased reporting of child victims of violence and a more effective identification of family vulnerabilities. A similar experience was found in the work to support the transition of the disability status determination system from a purely medical to a functional model. The increased engagement with stakeholders on national, regional and local levels enabled the mobilization of political will in the Government to commit to the scale up of the new disability assessment instrument under development and testing.

The leveraging of resources and partnerships for children change strategy was also successful in mobilizing funds for the implementation of the MICS 6 in Georgia. Against the background of the need for SDG baseline data, the public concern and anecdotal evidence about high lead levels in blood, UNICEF Georgia successfully forged a broad partnership of donors to support the MICS with its integrated blood testing for lead.  

UNICEF Georgia’s strong focus on mobilizing resources for children during 2018 also helped to further strengthen the partnerships with its three biggest donors; the European Union, SIDA and USAID. New partnerships were established with SDC and AFD, and collaboration expanded with emerging donors, especially the Governments of Estonia, Poland and Bulgaria. Overall, more than US$5.8 million in Other Resources funding funds were raised locally during 2018.

Against the background of the strong reform commitment of the Government for the implementation of the EU Georgia Association Agreement, resource mobilization from the European Unionfor technical assistance to the Government in carrying out the child rights related reforms under the Association Agenda and National Human Rights Action Plan, proved to be an especially successful strategy. During 2018, four EU-funded programmes were implemented, of which two were finalized during the year while one new programme agreement was signed and a further programme negotiated with an envisaged start date in spring 2019.

With regard to the mobilization of EU and other funding, joint UN programming has become an effective strategy for the UNICEF in Georgia. Three of the four EU programmes under implementation during 2018 were joint UN programmes: UNDP (Access to Justice);the United Nations High Commission for Refugees/UNHCR and UNDP (Access to Quality Education in Abkhazia); andthe International Labour Organization/ILO, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights/OHCHR and UNDP(Human Rights for All). Out of the two new EU-funded programmes negotiated during 2018, one is a joint UN programme with the Food and Agriculture Organization/FAO and on Improving Vocational Education in Abkhazia). UNICEF Georgia furthermore is implementing jointly with UNDP a USAID-funded programme in Abkhazia that formally is not a joint UN programme (UNDP-USAID agreement), but in practice is managed between UNDP and UNICEF like a joint UN programme.

Using UN joint programming as a resource mobilization and programme implementation strategy in Georgia has proven successful and effective for four reasons. First, this approach enables more effective resource mobilization, cooperation and coordination between involved UN agencies in their efforts to fundraise in a difficult funding environment and to work together to support implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Second, this approach demonstrates the ability of the UN to deliver as one in areas where several agencies have key contributions to make in line with their comparative advantages and added values to achieve the change envisaged by nationalized SDG targets and development strategies. Third, this approach provides both donors and UN agencies the possibility of cost efficiencies and reduced bureaucratic procedures in comparison to multiple bilateral agreements. And fourth, in the political context of Abkhazia, joint UN programming has enabled agencies to join efforts in safeguarding their operational space, demonstrating impartiality and implementing conflict-sensitive programmes in a politically complex and challenging environment.

Overall, joint UN programming requires the willingness for compromise and the acceptance that other agencies might lead the process with a donor. It also demands a high degree of flexibility in the application of rules, regulations and procedures of involved agencies to enable smooth cooperation. Further efforts of the involved UN agencies will be necessary to adapt their rules, regulations and procedures and to develop successful standard practices that enable a smoother cooperation within joint UN programmes. However, against the background of the limited availability of funding, joint programming has become an approach that is increasingly applied by both UN agencies and major donors in Georgia.

Constraints 

Constraints during 2018 emanated mainly from the political context, as well as the funding environment in Georgia. The resignation of the Prime Minister and Government in June and the formation of a new, restructured Government led to structural and personnel changes within UNICEF’s key partners, which in turn caused a delay in the implementation of a number of planned activities. The transition in Government also led to the temporary suspension of the meetings of thematic SDG working groups.

A fundamental constraint remained UNICEF’s funding situation and the limited public spending for children in a middle-income country like Georgia. This continued to make programming for sustainable at-scale results for children difficult. Due to limitations in available Regular Resources and Other Resources funding, UNICEF continued during 2018 to focus on the provision of technical assistance and policy advice, as well as limited piloting of model services in health, education and child protection. The number of agreed pilots however, is limited, as public spending for children remained insufficient to scale up more than a few. To enable the development and upscaling of more pilot services for children in Georgia, UNICEF will continue to advocate for increased budget spending for children on central, regional and local levels, and, together with the Government, increase efforts to mobilize funding from the private sector.

In the Abkhazia region, the constraints for UNICEF’s work emanating from the political context of the protracted conflict remained strong during 2018. UNICEF continued to successfully expand its health, education and child protection programmes in the region and moved from a humanitarian approach to a more development-oriented approach. However, due to the disputed status of the region, UNICEF is not able to apply key development approaches, including capacity building for governmental agencies and support to the development of legislation, policies and strategies. UNICEF’s efforts are therefore limited to advocacy, capacity building for local professionals, support to service provision and work at community level. This makes the achievement of sustainable results for children extremely difficult. At the same time, as with other international development agencies, UNICEF has no access to South Ossetia.

"
ECAR,Kazakhstan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
In 2018, the partnership between the Government of Kazakhstan and UNICEF continued to support the country’s efforts to further advance progress toward the sustained realization of children’s rights, with particular attention to the rights of the most vulnerable children and their families. The partnership focused on enhancing the protective environment for children and adolescents, reducing societal tolerance toward violence and improving related monitoring and enforcement systems. Insights were gained on what has worked and where further improvements are needed. The following lessons learned, covering all sectors in which UNICEF is engaged, will help strengthen UNICEF’s support to the country on the path to more sustainable development. 

The evaluations of UNICEF Kazakhstan’s models and programmes provided lessons on juvenile justice and adolescent mental health, among other areas. By and large, those lessons revolve around the need for stronger monitoring and evaluation (M&E) frameworks, more effective gender sensitivity, and increased engagement of local stakeholders to ensure sustainability.

The major lesson learned during the evaluation activities in 2018 concerned strengthening monitoring and evaluation (M&E) frameworks in all of UNICEF’s models. Independent assessments revealed that lack of strong monitoring systems was a barrier to feedback on the intervention practices and hampered the capture of outcomes and impacts. Stronger monitoring tools should be developed and implemented from the start of activities, jointly with implementing partners. The development of a comprehensive M&E framework also would lead to greater accountability with regard to results. A well-developed M&E framework also will present an opportunity to build implementing partners’ skills in tracking programme effectiveness and give them stronger ownership of delivery at local level.

The authorities’ limited capacity in data analysis makes it difficult for them to make decisions that are evidence-based.  Building analytical capacity, evidence-based policy and managerial decision-making capacity at national and local levels is an area that requires government attention. This is particularly so at subnational level in relation to evidence-based planning, budgeting and monitoring. Systematically conducting rigorous research about children’s development should become the basis of child and social policy planning. UNICEF will advocate with national and local stakeholders for such research.

During 2015-2017, the Government of Kazakhstan, with UNICEF support, piloted the ‘Adolescent Mental Health and Suicide Prevention programme’ in Kyzylorda Oblast. A key lesson from the programme evaluation was that the issue of adolescent mental health and suicide is incredibly sensitive in Kazakhstan. Opposition to the programme was mostly stigma-related. UNICEF recognized the stigma associated with suicide, so the programme also emphasized mental health and well-being and life skills, rather than suicide prevention alone. The evaluation also highlighted the importance of using a gender and equity focus, which, if ignored, can mean programmes do not address factors that may contribute to self-harm and may stigmatize some groups (particularly males) and preventing them from accessing services and support. 

The evaluation found that a key aspect of the success of the Adolescent Mental Health and Suicide Prevention pilot was the political will, ownership and leadership demonstrated at all levels of government, which resulted in an effective multi-sectoral approach. UNICEF Kazakhstan will continue to use such an approach for all its programme work.

In 2018, UNICEF also finalized two evaluations on juvenile justice reform, one of the key areas of UNICEF’s involvement in 2014-2017. This experience provided UNICEF Kazakhstan with valuable lessons and understanding for reforms in the area of justice for children, given the country context of many regions with diverse practices on the ground. A key lesson learned was the importance of accurate and disaggregated quantitative data. Lack of such data posed an obstacle to the in-depth analysis of the programme’s impact. UNICEF has begun to pay specific attention to statistics in relation to justice for children, but confusion remains around the terminology employed. Another remaining gap was the lack of gender-disaggregated data on children involved in criminal proceedings. This implies that in any reform, specific consideration should be paid, as early as possible, to the quality and disaggregation of quantitative data, so as to ensure the existence of clear baselines and the analysis of the impact on different groups.

An evaluation of early childhood development practices provided a lesson pertaining to private sector involvement. The Government recognized the importance of public private partnership in preschool education and has advanced this approach. The introduction of public private partnership in the early education sector has rapidly increased preschool enrolment rates in Kazakhstan. But the evaluation showed that implementation of such partnership in early childhood education requires a more robust analysis of all partnership models and their impact on learning outcomes in order to be able to inform corrective measures that ensure value for money. The evaluation also indicated that national policy should consider alternative mechanisms for private sector involvement in preschool education delivery in rural areas. UNICEF will continue to use these lessons in its advocacy with the Government.

UNICEF Kazakhstan’s technical assistance also included supporting transformation of residential care facilities in two regions of Kazakhstan. A change in the focus of the national government from transformation of residential institutions to prevention of institutionalisation, gatekeeping and establishment of child support centres left local authorities without any instructions from the Ministry of Education, meaning that they were not proactive in developing transformation plans. Subsequently, local level authorities in two regions were considering closing two residential institutions, without having made any plans for transition or for the establishment of alternative services. Family support services are outsourced to the non-government sector, and a lack of standards, clear targets and referral systems means that these services are of low quality. As a result, work with central and local authorities should be continued to strengthen their capacity to develop plans and standards for transformed/alternative services.

The transition to international classification on functioning, disability and health was constrained due to the low awareness of specialists and a lack of practical guides about its application. To realize its commitments under UNCRPD, the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection began to develop a new National Plan on the rights and quality of life of persons with disability for 2019-2023. The plan is scheduled to be adopted in 2019. UNICEF, through its participation in a high level government working group on disability, continued raising awareness about the social model of disability and inclusion of home-schooled children with disabilities in mainstream education.

UNICEF Kazakhstan worked to ensure the longevity and sustainability of its programmes. As their implementation unfolds, programmes can encounter obstacles in their sustainability. For example, when diversion measures and probation programmes were introduced, a number of local partner institutions lacked ownership of the pilot programmes. In one region, this resulted in a lack of feedback from the NGOs, and stakeholders considered that the project was not successful. From the start, the pilots were intended to be implemented by NGOs, without any funding from local government authorities. Although short-term funding was secured, the lack of financial contribution is believed to have lessened the sustainability of the intervention as far as permanent funding is concerned. The absence of legislative provisions and clearly prescribed mechanisms for these models in national and local bylaws also hurt sustainability prospects. UNICEF will put greater focus on this area and work to ensure the operational and financial participation of government stakeholders involved in the programme from the start and continuing throughout the implementation phase.

UNICEF Kazakhstan will shift its role more to advocacy and to that of lead technical expert. UNICEF has knowledge that could be used to support the scaling up of interventions. This is especially relevant as UNICEF continues to put significant efforts into facilitating beyond-border exchange of Kazakhstan's knowledge and experience in areas where it has achieved significant results for children. 





"
ECAR,Kosovo (UN SC resolution 1244),Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
In line with UNICEF’s Strategic Plan and the 2030 Agenda, three lessons learned informed UNICEF’s programme in Kosovo: 

1. The need to scale-up equity-focused programming by adopting the leave no child behind policy and focusing interventions on the most disadvantaged children 
Children from Roma, Ashkali, Egyptian and Kosovo-Serbian communities, children with disabilities and those living in rural areas are significantly more deprived and receive less support. UNICEF introduced the idea of a leave no child behind policy to partners, including the MoH and MEST. The MoH committed to achieving universal coverage of primary healthcare services while delivering services to those most in need and those hardest to reach, as well as achieving the SDG targets. Partners, including the MoH and the Government of Luxemburg, committed additional resources for scaling-up the home visiting programme, with a vision for full coverage by 2021, including Serb-majority municipalities. The MEST recognized UNICEF’s innovative programmes, namely UPSHIFT, Podium and Ponder, as solutions that should reach all adolescents in Kosovo. An agreement was signed with the MEST for incorporation of these innovative programmes into the existing formal upper secondary education curriculum. 

2. The need to scale up evidence-based advocacy and support for data management systems to inform policymaking 
Despite political commitment, weak implementation of the legal and policy framework remains a critical bottleneck to achieving progress toward fulfilling children’s rights in Kosovo. Significant data gaps and lack of institutional capacity to generate reliable data hinder evidence-based policymaking, monitoring and targeted interventions. UNICEF Kosovo sought to improve the availability, quality and use of data to better analyse patterns of development needs and address risks by strengthening the routine statistics system and generating evidence, including through surveys and evaluations. Endorsement of the SDG resolution by the Kosovo Assembly in January 2018 and commitment by partners, including the Assembly and the UN Kosovo team, to implement the MICS in 2019 provided an opportunity to further strengthen national capacities on data generation, based on advanced and validated methodologies. Once completed, the MICS will inform equity-focused coordination and follow-up on development needs, tracking the implementation of both the UN strategic framework and the 2030 Agenda in Kosovo. 

UNICEF Kosovo made a substantive contribution to evidence-based and equity-focused programming, aiming to achieve the target of devoting at least 1 per cent of programme expenditures to evaluation. The country office will take part in a multi-country evaluation of the home visiting programme under the leadership of UNICEF’s regional office in 2019. In addition, partners acknowledged the need to conduct a formative evaluation of UNICEF’s innovative adolescent programming during the remainder of the 2016–2020 country programme. 

3. The need to harness people’s social power and leverage the power of business and markets for children, adolescents and young people 
UNICEF Kosovo championed the UNICEF Volunteer Initiative in collaboration with the Global Volunteer Office. This collaboration has created an enabling environment to work with volunteers, supporters and influencers, including celebrities with the ability to speak for the voiceless and bring UNICEF programmes closer to communities. In addition, this new way of engaging partners created a space for meaningful dialogue with more than 50 business executives and owners to leverage the power of business and markets for children, adolescents and youth in Kosovo. This formed part of UNICEF’s efforts to accelerate and mainstream engagement with private sector organizations into regular UNICEF strategic programming. 

From this perspective, UNICEF established a partnership with corporate social responsibility, which generated a call for action for greater investment in the social dimensions of the SDGs and to become more involved in community-based programme initiatives, especially those that promote skills for life, entrepreneurial skills and skills for work.

Optimizing an effective mix of strategies and partnerships for the CP 2018–2020
The cross-cutting strategies and partnerships deployed by UNICEF Moldova in the first year of its new CP contributed to effective and efficient delivery of programme results and laid a solid foundation for further strengthening government-led action on implementing child rights in Moldova. UNICEF continued to work on institutional strengthening of national systems at both the central and local levels, specifically through engagement in two key sector strategy reviews (education and youth) and by supporting a review of Chisinau’s municipal’s directorate for child protection. Such engagements allowed the country programme to apply international norms and good practices, which inevitably will have a positive impact on outcomes for children. 

Intensified advocacy aimed at winning support for the cause of children and mobilizing Government, donors and the public at large to focus on the needs of the most vulnerable children, while also promoting duty-bearers’ full engagement in support for realization of child rights. Policy dialogue and technical expertise supported improved implementation of key child-related reforms, such as early childhood education and child protection. 

Communication for behaviour change boosted further positive change in social norms and contributed to a reduction in negative practices, such as violent discipline, discrimination, child abandonment and vaccine hesitancy, while promoting the adoption of positive child care practices by caregivers. Knowledge generation and child rights monitoring ensured evidence and publicly available data supporting both advocacy and policy development. 

UNICEF Moldova support complemented joint UN efforts to map SDG indicators and highlight data gaps, in particular data related to child poverty (both monetary and multidimensional). As in previous country programme cycles, capacity development of Government and civil society received special attention in all programme interventions, aiming to bring children to the forefront of stakeholders’ agenda and ensure coordinated delivery of quality services for children and adolescents. UNICEF Moldova also continued to develop new, and strengthen existing, partnerships in an effort to leverage resources for children and ensure vital financing from the Government, development partners, private sector and CSOs for child- related services. Additional expertise and transfer of best practices were achieved through horizontal cooperation with traditional partners of Moldova, such as Romania, and other neighbouring countries. Innovative approaches for programming, financing and provision of quality child-related services that could be scaled up were tested through modelling at the local level. 

Local governments: critical points of change 
Political instability, multiple central government reforms and preparations for early-2019 general elections affected the robust advancement of child-related reforms and the introduction of quality programmes and services for children at the local level. Furthermore, the alienation of local governments from decision-making processes, various misconceptions about the decentralization process and limited understanding by local public authorities of public finance mechanisms posed additional constraints. The decentralization reform, which began in 2013, aimed to strengthen the capacity of local public authorities to improve the management and quality of public services provided to citizens. But lack of clarity and ownership over the provision of these services, as well as largely insufficient financing to meet demand affected the successful provision of key services to the population, including early childhood education, social assistance services and youth programmes.  

For instance, the government approved an action plan for the implementation of a home visiting programme and began to apply the guidelines in early 2018. However, due to misconceptions, guidelines met sizeable resistance from primary health care professionals. Plans to build these professionals’ skills on the use of new tools were not comprehensively realized. Thus the implementation of guidelines on home visiting had to be postponed and replaced with concerted advocacy and capacity building focusing on nurses, mother and child health specialists and family doctor associations to demonstrate the value-added and benefits of using the new guideline and tools for both nurses/family doctors and parents/caregivers, and to counter misconceptions that their introduction would entail an additional burden, as perceived by the professionals. Considerable delays also occurred in piloting of the PBF for youth friendly health service, due to long-term negotiations and disagreements over the proposed modalities for PBF implementation and related financial mechanisms, underlining the need for strengthened dialogue among institutions. 

Another constraint faced by UNICEF Moldova in 2018 was the perception of the local public authorities’ role as mere implementers of national policies, along with their own misconceptions about decentralization. The latter is seen not as an opportunity for them to manage their own budgets in a much more flexible way, but rather as a barrier that would negatively impact their ability to finance social services, previously fully centralized and covered at 100 per cent by the central government.  

This speaks to an urgent need, to invest in building capacities in PFM at both the central and local levels. A critical challenge jeopardizing the delivery of quality child and adolescent related services is rapidly shrinking availability and high turnover of human resources in all child-related sectors (education, primary health care, youth and social assistance). This challenge needs to be vigorously addressed through the development of robust, sector-specific human resource strategies (including salary adjustments) to offset the current negative return of investment in capacity-building efforts, and will be built into CP advocacy and technical assistance efforts. 

The important lesson learned is that the sub-national decision-making arena is a critical point of change, and local governments need enhanced communication on the benefits of decentralization, as well as increased attention to their capacity-building needs. 

Several other lessons learned in 2018 are derived from developments driven by the broader context, including changes and processes at the regional and global levels. 

2018 UN reform in the middle-income country operational context
As reflected in UNICEF Moldova’s CP fundraising strategy, the middle-income country operational context is somewhat constrained by declining overseas development assistance to multilateral organizations such as the UN system. Increased competition for resources also limiting opportunities for the UN system to provide quality technical support to key government reforms. This, coupled with the suspension of bilateral budgetary financial support due to political instability, may further jeopardize the implementation of key child-related policies and programmes, thus limiting opportunities for vulnerable children and their families to escape a situation of marginalization and inequality. Situations such as this may require a rethinking of UNICEF’s role and engagement in certain middle-income country contexts, with a view to identifying innovative ways to collaborate and cooperate with development partners, governments, children and their families under a unified UN system. 

Summer 2018 measles outbreak 
The outbreak provided several important lessons learned regarding the importance of inter-sectoral coordination and the need for high-level engagement to further boost immunization coverage in the country; strengthen capacity of the health workforce for quality service delivery and immunization promotion; and improve the evidence base, while building a strong and responsive immunization information system. 

Appropriate and ongoing communication and engagement of local and central authorities with ethnic or religious minority groups is pivotal to address negative social norms, such as anti-vaccination beliefs and immunization hesitancy. Also evident is the need to maintain a continuous dialogue with the public at large and build greater awareness among parents on positive parenting practices. Further development of communication strategies, both through traditional and online channels, is required to reach out to marginalized groups and ensure that individuals understand the value of immunization and boost the demand for vaccination. 

2018 Facebook algorithm
Several lessons were learned in the first half of 2018 in relation to social media. A specific constraint faced was related to the new algorithm applied by Facebook, favouring individual posts over page content. The new Facebook algorithm now ranks all available posts that can display on a user’s news feed based on how likely that user is to have a positive reaction towards the posts. Thus, from the beginning of 2018, Facebook started favouring posts of individuals who received higher engagement from other users, making it harder for pages, including UNICEF Moldova’s page, to reach people. Facebook statistics indicated that UNICEF Moldova content reached only 2-3 per cent of the audience. To enhance UNICEF’s visibility on social media and address the new algorithm challenges, several strategies were employed: video content, especially live videos, was prioritized, as Facebook gives more weight to videos; cross-posting was used; and engaging content was produced to initiate conversations with the audience, especially on Messenger, as this content is also prioritized by Facebook. As a result, both reach and engagement considerably increased. The number of followers on UNICEF Moldova’s Facebook page doubled in one year: from 13,700 in 2017, to 27,500 in 2018.

Enforcement of EU general data protection regulation 
With enforcement in 2018 of the EU general data protection regulation 2016/679, the general public became more aware of their right to protection of their personal data. While privacy and copyright laws in Moldova allow taking photos of people in public, including children, many Moldovan parents and caregivers who either work in EU countries or have close relatives and friends abroad became increasingly concerned about protecting their children’s personal data, including images. At the same time, Moldova’s Civil Code was amended in 2018, specifically allowing pictures to be taken without restriction in public places. Many grey areas remain, however, leaving room for differing interpretations, even among professionals. Following this changing legal landscape on data protection, several challenges and constraints related to photography were encountered in 2018, requiring new methods of photography at public events when there is no opportunity to obtain explicit consent. A cautious approach was also required to deciding about application of the blue wash mask in accordance with new branding guidelines. Overall, the lesson learned was that unrelenting caution should be used when working with images of children.

Looking forward
In the coming four years of programme implementation, the Country Programme will build on these and further lessons learned to adjust, in a dynamic and flexible way, the CP’s approach to the changing country context in order to achieve tangible, equity-focused results for children in Moldova. Immediate, strategically focused action will continue for support to the development of the new education sector strategy aligned with SDGs and Moldova 2030 aspirations and UNICEF Moldova’s engagement in a comprehensive review of the youth sector in 2019. Priorities will also include developments at the global and regional levels, including the recent simultaneous launch at the high-level event of the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly of the UN Youth Strategy 2030 and Generation Unlimited partnership, which seek increased opportunities and investments for children and young people to ensure that every young person is empowered, participates and is in some form of school, learning, training or employment by 2030. 

The expanded partnership with Chisinau Municipality will see stronger UNICEF Moldova engagement in reviewing the work of the departments of education, health, social protection and youth, with clear opportunities for leveraging government funds for the delivery of quality maternal, child and youth services in the country’s largest municipality. The CP will further deepen its engagement in building capacities in PFM at both the central and local levels, as well as in identifying opportunities to advocate for strengthened data collection and usage in planning and budgeting services for children, aligned to national strategies. 

Furthermore, while operating in a middle-income countries context involving a dwindling aid flow, UNICEF Moldova will further pursue efforts to mobilize resources, to ensure that all children in the country, especially the most vulnerable, enjoy their rights to education, health, an adequate standard of living, and participation within a child-friendly environment, and are protected from abandonment, neglect, discrimination, exploitation and violence.

Human rights programming  
As with many countries in the region and beyond, the human rights agenda has come under direct attack from emerging populist movements, getting particular traction in rural and post-industrial towns and communities. It is widely assessed that this is the outcome of a growing perception that human rights are not universal, but primarily in the interests of urban populations, and that they prioritize disadvantaged minority groups over majority communities affected by poverty. This had the effect of narrowing support for protection of minorities and undermining a broader human rights agenda.

Throughout the reporting period, UNICEF sought to re-universalize human rights for children in the perception of the public, by reaching out to traditional religious leaders to garner support for its campaigns and reforms, and by reaching out and listening to communities outside the capital.

The first example is the #ParentingIsAlsoLearned campaign which sought to break the taboo and open up a public discussion on violence against children, including neglect and sexual abuse – topics never before been discussed publicly. UNICEF briefed key stakeholders on plans beforehand and presented evidence from global and national research on adverse childhood experiences to raise awareness of the costs to society of violence against children. Upon field testing with diverse review groups, digital materials were launched. The language was changed from the preachy “ENDviolence” or stop hitting children to a narrative of “Parenting is Also Learned” – which recognizes that parenting is difficult and challenging, that there is good evidence on which approaches are better for our children, and that if are applied them children will do better. 

The most innovative approach, however, was the convening of public town hall meetings in five locations, which were very well attended (several hundred people at each) and represented the first time that people had ever participated in a public discussion on parenting, violence, abuse and neglect. The events were designed as an engaging combination of entertaining facilitation, emotionally compelling—yet positive—children’s performance, followed by Ted Talk style presentations by the UNICEF Representative and two or three national experts on parenting, attachment and social and emotional development of children, and finally, a panel, comprising all speakers, fielding questions from the audience. This proved to be an essential contribution to the success of the events, as it demonstrated willingness to be in communities far from the capital and engage with people who very rarely feel that their voice is heard. This honest conversation approach seemed to win popular support for what could have been a controversial campaign, allowing conservative or populist forces might to argue that the sovereignty of the family was being violated. Another lesson learned was that when attachment, adversity and violence are discussed in a non-threatening way, people really identify with it and recognize it in themselves, their family and their community. This may be the way to gain momentum and advance #ENDviolence.

A similar experience brought a sea-change in the disability inclusion debate in the country. In mid-2018, inhabitants of Timjanik, a semi-rural village in the south of the country, protested against the opening of a small group home for children with severe disabilities, as part of de-institutionalization reforms. A government minister and the UNICEF Representative visited the community and were met by a very vocal crowd of about 500 people. For about three hours, the people of Timjanik voiced their concerns, while the UNICEF Representative and the minister carefully listened and tried to respond, at times in the face of aggressive and angry protests. This played out on national media and inspired a huge movement in support of the de-institutionalization process on social media. At this point, other mayors came forward offering to host the small group home in different municipalities. The next day the minister and the UNICEF representative were asked at a media event what they thought about the protests. Instead of criticizing the protesters, both articulated the very real concerns that rural communities affected by poverty and poor services have and pointed out that the protests were more about questioning why the home is a spending priority rather that discrimination against people with disability. This built very strong trust with community members, who collectively reversed their decision and agreed to host the small group home, which is now flourishing in that community. Turning up, braving the protest and listening and demonstrating that their concerns had been heard and understood, turned around what seemed to be a populist, anti-minority action in a community. More importantly, however, it sparked a significant national debate on disability in which human rights values prevailed. The Government adopted a UNICEF-supported strategy on child welfare reform called Timjanik – in honour of what happened in that community and what it meant for the wider society.

Finally, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is affected by a persistent child poverty rate of almost 30 per cent, worsening health and education sector performance and high levels of family violence. During the reporting period, UNICEF re-framed the way it addresses vulnerability, seeking a stronger balance between universal issues like education and health reform and vulnerability issues such as disability inclusion or migration, to ensure that these issues do not compete in the way that they did in Timjanik.

System-strengthening 
While UNICEF Macedonia continued the crucial work of capacity development of staff in key sectors to accompany reforms, it also concluded that the Government needs to review staff motivation, as well as drivers and barriers to good staff performance. Research on the psychology of motivation suggests that the main drivers of a well-motivated and high- performing workforce are: sense of purpose, autonomy, growing competence and a sense of belonging. A visit by a pioneering behavioural insights team from the United Kingdom was arranged to review work-flow processes and rules and regulations in the education and social welfare workforces, and to evaluate the extent to which they motivate and improve performance. The team’s recommendations will be piloted in early 2019, in collaboration with the national Innovation Fund, and could become a model for overall public administration reform.

Similarly, UNICEF’s work to support the education sector to strengthen social and emotional learning and capacity for innovation and entrepreneurship in secondary schools, it was recognized that within the teacher workforce, conditions for building a pedagogy around these issues was compounded by the inherently non-entrepreneurial way that the sector currently functions. Thus, the #Upshift and #GenerationUnlimited programmes were established, and  agreements were reached with the national Bureau for Education Development that the pedagogy and learning for teaching children innovation and entrepreneurship would be fed back into the education sector, as part of efforts to mainstream the core content of #Upshift into schools for all children.

During the reporting period, the OECD, UNICEF and other partners concluded that one of the key bottlenecks contributing to poor education outcomes was that the Ministry of Education and Science lacks the capacity to adequately analyse data collected from schools, rationalize education sector resources and measure ideas for reform against international evidence. A similar gap exists in other ministries, preventing reform-minded ministers from pursuing an evidence-driven strategic path. In this regard, in 2018 UNICEF supported the development of an analytical unit that will use evidence to determine policy. If successful, this model could be used in other sectors.

A key constraint during the reporting period was delays in UNICEF-supported legislative changes in the Parliament, due to extended parliamentary debate and political campaign activities related to the 2018 referendum on the country’s name. Moreover, as in previous years and like other countries in the Western Balkan region, the public agenda was often dominated by ethnicity-related and nationalistic rhetoric. This limited the possibility for productive debate on key social policy issues such as child poverty, quality of education and improved health services. To this end, UNICEF sought to promote a coherent and integrated national public narrative on childhood by: promoting simplified and localized global evidence and research on child development, assisting local experts to develop public communication skills and using social media. This approach led to a three-fold increase in mainstream and social media coverage of these issues, creating more demand and policy space for reforms for children.

ECAR,Rep of Uzbekistan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Access to reliable data remained a major bottleneck for evidence-based programming and policy advocacy. UNICEF focused on improving systems for administrative data management in health, education and social protection. UNICEF introduced management information systems on electronic platforms to make reliable data available. UNICEF also supported a number of initiatives such as the National Nutrition Survey, the Youth Survey and the study on profiles of children with low learning achievement. A study on the situation of children affected by migration was ongoing at year end. In some other areas a different strategy is taken up for overcoming the challenge. In communication for development a shorter-term interim solution is adopted: In developing communication strategies a general framework of the strategies is developed based on the available data, and then plans are further streamlined and fine-tuned through validation exercises.

Access to communities was another constraint that made it difficult to validate relevance of programmes, to implement programmes that promote demand for services or to conduct data collection exercises such as surveys. Introducing and promoting platforms such as Ureport or ‘Youth Talks’ jointly with government partners partially addressed that constraint. In other cases, such as large-scale surveys or studies, partnering with other development agencies such as UN agencies or the World Bank washelpful to remove bottlenecks to implementation.  

To increase equity in UNICEF programming,access to the most marginalized groups is needed. That can best be achieved by NGOs and CSOs, which are either non-existent or lack operational capacity. UNICEF tried to overcome this challenge by increasing its interaction with community-based organizations at local level in a CRM programme that focused on developing capacity for monitoring children’s rights and creating local development plans.

Lower levels of capacity in local government and highly centralized systems of decision-making posed challenges for the implementation of initiatives such as the District Health System Strengthening programme and others that had a very strong local-level implementation component. UNICEF incorporated a strong capacity development component into this programme and engaged in high-level advocacy with national authorities to ensure steady implementation.

The pace of development programmes increased considerably in the last two years. Supporting the reforms planned by the Government requires UNICEF’s constant engagement as well as flexibility and readiness to address needs immediately. UNICEF Uzbekistan addressed this challenge by maintaining a cadre of highly qualified professionals who provide high-level technical advice to partners.

In some areas, specifically child protection and social protection, the absence of a lead agency to implement programmes or coordinate efforts of different stakeholders resulted in delays in programme implementation. To address this, UNICEF promoted the establishment of coordination mechanisms such as the Inter-Agency Coordination Council on Child Rights. UNICEF also actively engaged with partners to promote the concept of a single agency in charge of all aspects of social protection. Child protection and social protection receive little attention from the donor community. To increase funding in the long term for those programmes, UNICEF increased its engagement with partners such as the World Bank and the European Union.

Constraints

Certain issues relevant to the realization of children’s rights in Kyrgyzstan remain unresolved from the Millennium Development Goals era, and require accelerated efforts to achieve the SDGs. These include: child poverty, infant and maternal mortality, violence against boys and girls, stigma and discrimination based on disability or HIV or AIDS status, poor learning achievement and youth unemployment. All of these factors are at risk of being aggravated by challenges that directly affect children and young people, such as: growing social and gender disparities, the fragile social fabric, violence, climate change, globalization and internal and external migration. 

To address system inefficiencies and barriers that prevent children and their families from enjoying their basic rights, concerted efforts and strong partnerships are needed to push for evidence-based decision making, due enforcement of policies, equitable allocation and effective use of domestic resources with clear accountability for results and effective cross-sectoral coordination. Critical concerns for the social sector include: a weak system of governance, monitoring and evaluation and results-based management in the social sectors; the absence of programme budgeting in practice; and an unclear division of labour among central authorities and local self-governance bodies with regard to service provision to children and their families.

Lessons learned 

Provision of micronutrient sprinkles: The success of a pilot programme providing micronutrient sprinkles in Talas Province prompted the scaling-up of the programme to all provinces (except Bishkek) beginning in June 2011. Between 2012 and 2018 the MoH provided micronutrient sprinkles, with support from UNICEF and other development partners. The sprinkles, known locally as Gulazyk, were provided to all infants aged 6–24 months as part of the broader national anaemia prevention and control strategy. The programme included a nutrition education component to encourage breastfeeding and appropriate complementary feeding.  

The Gulazyk programme relied on three main channels: primary health care providers, village health committee volunteers and the mass media. The programme was supported by several policy documents, including the 2012–2018 health reform programme, and the 2015–2017 food security and nutrition programme. Analysis of data from national surveys on children’s nutritional status conducted by the MoH, UNICEF, Centres for Disease Control and the National Statistical Committee between 2009 and 2013 indicated significant improvements in iron deficiency rates. 

The Gulazyk programme was fully maintained by the Government and development partners at national level until April 2014. After this time disruptions began to emerge in the provision of Gulazyk. Although integration of Gulazyk into infant and young child feeding practices in communities was considered effective, the procurement platforms required to sustain the practice were challenging. Procurement difficulties were further exacerbated by competing priorities related to high disease burden and limited capacity and resources at the national and local levels.

Despite the positive trends, as of 2018, the MoH ceased to procure Gulazyk. UNICEF issued a statement on behalf of development partners about the safety and effectiveness of multiple micronutrient powder and conducted a number of advocacy meetings. However, the MoH asserted that Gulazyk was registered as a biologically active supplement and thus not considered part of the essential medicines list. Moreover, the Ministry noted concern regarding the conclusions of recent Cochrane reviews and WHO guidelines. This literature pointed to the low quality of existing research methodology on the effectiveness of micronutrients, with high risk of deviation for various target groups during pregnancy and for the treatment of anaemia among mothers and children. 

Despite investment and efforts by UNICEF and other development partners, the matter remains sensitive and had not been resolved by 2018. The Gulazyk programme offers valuable lessons in relation to outcomes. There is a need to engage the Government, especially the MoH, through a systems-strengthening approach under which ministry ownership of the programme is paramount. Such ownership would allow for critical analysis of the evidence on the positive impact of interventions, which could then be jointly investigated and agreed upon. More broadly, there is a clear need to place food security and nutrition firmly within a health system strengthening approach, supported by community- and home-based information and communication approaches.

Even within the context of a pilot programme, it is also clear that planning is crucial at scale and within current government budgets from the outset, to enable advocacy for further investment once evidence suggests high impact. Rigorous monitoring and evaluation are essential when confirming and analysing data that will strengthen evidence-informed platforms for the institutionalization of programmes in line with Government priorities. 

Moving forward, UNICEF recognizes its role as a consensus builder and the opportunity that this provides to leverage the best results for children. Members of the MoH experts group, responsible for approving the procurement of medicines, and the nutrition group, responsible for coordinating and promoting all nutrition-related activities in the Ministry are clearly motivated by competing ideologies and scientific theories. Nevertheless, compromise should be reached in the best interests of children in Kyrgyzstan. Building on UNICEF’s knowledge base and constructive relationship with the Government, safe spaces for these dialogues and critical thinking could be fostered to address malnutrition and dietary deficiencies among mothers and children. Similarly, technical support could be provided on the budgetary implications of high-impact interventions and capacity analysis of systems to ensure that an enabling environment exists, and that systems have the capacity for scale-up and institutionalization. 

These lessons will shape UNICEF’s future investments, technical support and programming on nutrition. They provide valuable guidance for reflecting on what could have been done better and what is now possible, with new knowledge and understanding. 

Volunteer initiative: Acknowledging the potential of ‘people power’, UNICEF Kyrgyzstan launched the global volunteer initiative in January 2018 with a mandate to build or scale up volunteer programmes. Following the global ‘Our UNICEF’ initiative, in 2018 UNICEF launched a pilot project to engage university students as volunteers to support the country’s safe schools programme, successfully implementing the volunteer initiative to scale up programme activities. 

Implementation of the project consisted of five stages: 
• Stage 1: Mobilization of volunteers and competitive selection process. Forty volunteers aged 18 to 25 were selected from 300 applicants
• Stage 2: Capacity building training for volunteers to engage with schools 
• Stage 3: Volunteers undertook online activities, conducted an online advocacy campaign and simulation exercises and an online advocacy campaign to raise awareness about disaster risk reduction and the safe school programme
• Stage 4: Information session at the assigned schools. The volunteers provided high-quality information on the importance of DRR and safe behaviour skills to address various crisis scenarios
• Stage 5: Volunteers supported schools and teachers in conducting drills, as part of a disaster simulation exercise. They ensured that the drills were practised correctly and that children tested their safe behaviour skills in different crisis scenarios. 

UNICEF Kyrgyzstan recruited committed and active volunteers who have been adding value to UNICEF even beyond the scope of support for the safe schools programme. Each group has delivered excellent results and contributions to the project, but some individual volunteers have shown a surprising degree of passion and devotion to volunteering for children and UNICEF. Volunteers who made outstanding contributions inside and outside the scope of the project received special awards.

As a result of the volunteer initiative, UNICEF school-based DRR modelling coverage doubled, which has informed future programme development,. In line with the project design agreed with the MoES, 10 schools were supported in two cities. In addition, one of the volunteers initiated safety activities in one more school in another city. Overall, 11,000 schoolchildren, 550 parents and 1,000 teachers were reached by the safe school volunteer initiative and improved their DRR knowledge and safe behaviour skills. 

An accompanying media campaign mobilized more supporters of school preparedness. The number of followers on Instagram doubled in the three months following the launch of the volunteer initiative. The number of Facebook followers increased by at least 1,000 during the first phase of the project, and the total engagement rate from posts made by our volunteers was 33,295 ‘likes’. 

Achievements of the pilot phase of the volunteer initiative in Kyrgyzstan were noted by UNICEF’s Global Volunteers Office, which highlighted them on International Volunteers Day. and recommended that UNICEF Kyrgyzstan applied for the ‘Inspire Awards’ in 2019. 

The major lesson learned from this initiative is that UNICEF Kyrgyzstan’s capacity to scale up this kind of project must be strengthened, including recruitment of team members with experience working with large groups of volunteers and technical capacity to manage the scaling-up phase. Technical tools needed include an online selection system to receive and manage volunteer applications. 

Capacity building is the best way not only to help volunteers understand what is expected and what to expect, but also to sustain their motivation. For instance, some schools were not cooperative during the initial stages of the project and volunteers felt unwelcome and disappointed. Training on conflict management and how to interact with children could help to address this, as would preparing volunteers for the possibility that their initial contact with the school might be difficult. 

Sustaining the motivation of volunteers throughout the project was one of the most important and demanding aspects of the initiative. Most of the volunteers were highly motivated at the beginning of the project, but as time went by some of this motivation was lost. This was particularly true for young people who had university exams and assignments. Future volunteering initiatives should consider providing supplementary activities to boost motivation, such as career talks, CV/cover letter workshops and competitions (such as the online advocacy campaign included in the pilot volunteer initiative). The award ceremony was also a good way to motivate volunteers and ensure a high retention rate.

Based on the results of UNICEF Kyrgyzstan’s SkillShare workshop, the Global Volunteer Office will support an online application system to receive and manage volunteer applications. Capacity building training for volunteers will be expanded and include conflict management and child rights.

As a next step, UNICEF Kyrgyzstan will recruit an experienced team with sufficient experience in volunteer management to manage the scaling up of the project. Once the team has been formed, UNICEF will develop a detailed concept note on the safe school’ volunteer programme, with expanded project components such as schools without violence. It is expected that by the end of 2019, UNICEF Kyrgyzstan will have 100 volunteers contributing to the realization of children’s rights in the country.  





"
ECAR,Republic of Montenegro,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
The 2017–2021 UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation aims to support ongoing reforms in Montenegro through an integrated, holistic, evidence-based, result-oriented and multi-sectoral approach that focuses on key areas affecting child rights: health, childcare, social protection, education, participation, justice and finance. Particular attention is paid to strengthening institutional capacity in long-term strategic planning, evidence-based policymaking, child-focused budgeting and child rights monitoring. The key programme assumption is that the rights of all children in Montenegro will be progressively realized as more boys and girls benefit from quality, equitable and inclusive services and live in supportive family environments where they arebetter protected from adversity, exclusion and poverty. 

Completion of the work plan for 2017–2018 presented an important opportunity to take stock of the first two years of country programme implementation and reflect on areas for adjustment and acceleration. For this reason, UNICEF Montenegro held an internal strategic moment of reflection in 2018 to discuss achievements, constraints and lessons learned, including whether the programme components and results framework remain relevant and whether change strategies have been effective for achieving results for children. In late 2018 UNICEF consulted with a widerange of government and institutional partners (including the Ministries of Health, Education, Labour and Social Welfare andFinance and the EU Chief Negotiators Office) on key results achieved during 2017 and 2018 and key priorities for cooperation during the next biennial workplan. 

Relevance of programme components and results framework

An important conclusion from the strategic moment of reflection and partner consultations was that the UNICEF Country Programme Document programme components and results framework remained highly relevant in the context of the three interlinked national priorities being pursued by Montenegro (EU accession, the economic reform programme and the national sustainable development strategy). Realizing the rights of all children in Montenegro, especially those affected by poverty, adversity and exclusion, remained at the core of those national reform efforts and, with its strong focus on 'leaving no child behind', the UNICEF Country Programme represents a significant contribution to advancing Montenegro’s national aspirations. 

Effectiveness of key change strategies (‘what worked’)

UNICEF Montenegro employed a number of change strategies to achieve results at scale for children that have thus far proven to be effective.

Institutional strengthening of national systems 
As Montenegro continued to implement reforms to meet European Union accession requirements, UNICEF contributed to institutional strengthening of national systems. This was accomplished through technical assistance on evidence-based strategies and policies and upgrading sectoral information management systems. Capacity-building activities for professionals across different sectors to enhance coordination and strengthening of human rights-based and culturally sensitive approaches to working with vulnerable groups also contributed to that progress. 

With technical assistance from UNICEF Montenegro, the Government strengthened the legal framework and evidence-based policy development to provide quality and equitable services, as well as to enhance awarenessamong professionals and the general publicof children as rights-holders.Results of this work included: the new strategy for inclusive education, development of a new youth law (to be presented to the Parliament in 2019) and preparations for a 2019-2023 strategy on realization of child rights. 

With enhanced capacities of professionals in various sectors, a number of multi-sectoral system responses were initiated that need to be further strengthened. Those include the provision quality of care to children and their families; prevention of family separation; protection of children from violence and ensuring the rights of children with disabilities and children from minority groups. 

Harnessing the power of evidence (data and analysis) 
Evidence-generation was one of the main strategies used in 2018 to build a stronger knowledge base for informed policymaking related to ongoing reforms in different sectors, andto implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 

An independent evaluation of Montenegro’s Child Rights Monitoring system was completed.Its findings and recommendations were validated by national partners and implementation was underway, including involvement by children and adolescents in the preparation of a five-year strategy on realization of child rights, expected in 2019. 

The child poverty snapshot based on data collected through the EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions will enable the Government to assess the effectiveness of its development and social protection systems in responding to the needs of poor and vulnerable groups, especially children. The survey provides comparable data across EU member states and accession countries and fresh evidence for prioritizing responses to child poverty in all reforms linked to the EU accession process. 

A number of research studies and analyses were developed in 2018 to assess the national system’s performance and inform reforms and development of new policies on, for example: improved support for children with disabilities, enhancing the work of Centres for Social Work and identifying the training needs of patronage nurses to support families in nurturing care of young children. 

A flagship evidence-gathering activity in 2018 was UNICEF’s support to the National Statistical Office  to carry out the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, the country’s second-largest household survey. Survey data covered a sample of 7,000 households of the majority population and almost all Roma families living in settlements. For the first time, the survey also collected information on children with disabilities. The results, which will be available by mid-2019, will yield internationally comparable data on children and women and inform future evidence-based policymaking on children and monitoring implementation of the national sustainable development strategy.

Fostering innovation to empower adolescents
UNICEF continued to support the Youth Innovation Lab, which provides space and opportunity for young people, particularly the most marginalized, to practice innovation, co-create solutions to socio-economic challenges and build entrepreneurial skills. The Lab has added at least one programme per year on adolescent empowerment and participation. It runs UPSHIFT, Hackathon for Social Change, socio-emotional skills workshops in non-formal education environments and U-Report. UNICEF supported outreach to vulnerable adolescents, for example by including UPSHIFT teams from the North of the country, the region most affected by poverty, and by ensuring representation of adolescents from minority groups, such as Roma and Egyptians. Initiatives carried out by the Lab contributed to the generation of knowledge on adolescent empowerment at the global level. 

Montenegro was selected as one of 16 countries to take part in the first ‘Generation Unlimited Youth Challenge’ global competition, which encourages youth participation and engagement. At the regional level, UNICEF Montenegro facilitated knowledge exchange and shared good practices on UPSHIFT and U-Report with UNICEF offices in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Ukraine. 

Challenges (‘what did not work’) 

Montenegro made considerable progress in recent years toward upgrading its legal and policy framework on human rights, including child rights, to meet the requirements for EU accession and fulfil its international human rights obligations. Implementation of the legal and policy framework in terms of quality, inclusive services for children and adolescents and an effective child rights monitoring system require greater attention and investment. The April 2018 EU Enlargement Report noted: ‘On fundamental rights, Montenegro further aligned its legislation with EU standards. […] Implementation of the legislation remains weak and institutional capacity on human rights needs to be increased.’

This ‘implementation-gap’ is common among societies in transition. It is driven by a complex set of inter-linked systemic and societal challenges, including lack of multi-sectoral coordination and limited institutional capacities; insufficient systematic planning, budgeting and monitoring of programmes; limited systematic collection, analysis and use of disaggregated data for evidence-based policy making; and persistent, negative or harmful social norms that constitute barriers to fulfilling child rights.

UNICEF Montenegro also faced constraints around resource mobilization. As an upper-middle-income country and front-runner in the EU accession process, Montenegro experienced decreasing levels of overseas development aid in recent years, which limited resource mobilization opportunities with public sector donor partners.

Lessons learned

A key lesson learned from implementation of the 2017–2018 workplan was that in order to tackle existing constraints, UNICEF’s country programme focus needs to be sharpened. The assumption is that by concentrating on cross-cutting priority areas, UNICEF and partners will be able to accelerate and scale-up programming to achieve results for children, especially the most vulnerable. 

Given the cross-sectoral nature of the expected results for children and the need to engage with partners in a more integrated and holistic manner, UNICEF Montenegro decided to develop a cross-sectoral strategy to produce sustainable results in the lives of children. UNICEF took into consideration the facts thatmultiple, overlapping deprivations experienced by children cannot be addressed by any one sector alone and reaching the most vulnerable and excluded children requires holistic, multi-sectoral approaches. Accelerated progress is needed to reach the ambitious targets of the country programme and to support Montenegro to meet its EU accession goal and SDG commitments.

Child development needs to be prioritized as part of the national reform agenda in order to achieve sustainable results for children in Montenegro. Strengthening child development means that Montenegro will need to provide essential investments in human capital development, a key area of the economic reform programme. The April 2018 European Commission assessment of Montenegro’s 2017–2019 economic reform programme highlighted this as an area requiring further improvement, noting: ‘The key obstacle to growth and competitiveness remains the skills mismatch and weak inter-institutional cooperation between education and labour market [...]. Weak performance in basic education and low investments in teacher training and transversal skills affect performance in the later stages of education. This link with basic education is not acknowledged in the ERP.’

Given limited fiscal space and the Government’s commitment to reducing public debt, UNICEF will increasingly support authorities, including horizontal ministries such as the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Public Administration, to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of public spending and reallocation and redistribution of resources within the existing overall budgetary ceiling. The aim is to improve resource allocation, planning, targeting, coordination and monitoring of programmes to effectively meet the needs of vulnerable groups, especially children. 

Key strategies for 2019-2020

The review of the 2017–2018 workplan and recent government consultations constituted a valuable learning exercise for UNICEF Montenegro and informed the development of the draft 2019–2020 workplan.

Cross-sectoral strategy for enhanced coordination and programming at scale
Based on the 2017–2021 Country Programme, four cross-cutting priority areas were identified:
early childhood development; adolescent and young people’s skills and empowerment; safe, inclusive communities (protecting children from violence, adversity and exclusion, especially the most vulnerable and excluded groups) and child poverty reduction. 

In consultation with Government partners, it was agreed that those four multi-sectoral priorities would be addressed in the new 2019–2020 workplan. Concerted efforts will be needed to make that vision a reality. Partnership is essential to achieving cross-sectoral priorities. On the positive side, as a result of multi-year efforts, national and local partners from the health, education and child and social protection sectors have acquired increased understanding of the importance of multi-sectoral cooperation, and there is growing support for integrated approaches to deal with the most disadvantaged children and families. But in reality, the new strategy exists in the sector-based working context of a public administration faced with major reforms, transitional issues and rigid work processes. Additional expected challenges include limited cooperation between Government and civil society actors and a highly politicized, risk-averse society. The strategy may encounter implementation challenges, as the public administration perceives itself as already overburdened with the demands of the EU accession agenda, including public administration reform. This means that UNICEF will need to integrate the cross-sectoral approach in the already substantial programme of cooperation, ensure inclusion of all stakeholders, delicately manage power imbalances (between state and non-state actors and partners at national and local levels) and ensure close monitoring to facilitate implementation. 

Planning, budgeting and monitoring
Another key area for cooperation between the Government and UNICEF will be to ensure that child rights are placed at the core of the 2020–2021 Economic Reform Programme and ongoing public administration reform supported by the EU and other major donors. In response to requests from the Government, UNICEF will provide technical assistance for two major exercises in 2019–2020. UNICEF will support a comprehensive assessment of the social protection system to assess the extent to which social assistance and social and child protection services are responding to the needs of the poor and excluded. The assessment will help stakeholders to define a long-term vision for social protection with viable policy options that can be implemented within the existing fiscal space. UNICEF also will support an education sector analysis and plan, including support for resource mobilization, to strengthen institutional capacities for quality sector planning, budgeting, coordination and monitoring of education reforms. This will help the Government to develop a systemic and sustainable approach to reforms, mobilize additional resources, optimize public spending and ensure implementation.

Those efforts will be complemented by a sharper focus on child-responsive budgeting and public finance for children, in cooperation with the Ministry of Finance, to coincide with the introduction of programme budgeting in 2019, representing a major opportunity for ensuring that child rights are at the heart of the Economic Reform Programme. 

Strengthening evidence
More and better disaggregated data is needed to identify gaps and measure progress toward ‘leaving no child behind’. Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey results will provide a wealth of new data on child well-being, including on Roma children and, for the first time, children with disabilities. The survey will inform implementation of EU accession reforms and the national strategy on sustainable development 2030, as well as the creation of future evidence-based policies relevant to children and families. Together with the child poverty data from the EU-Survey on Income and Living Conditions 2013-2017, the survey will provide opportunities for UNICEF to support a comprehensive analysis of child poverty, including multi-dimensional poverty, as one of the key underlying causes of child rights violations. 

Strengthening advocacy and communication for social change and leveraging partnerships for children
Continued advocacy and communication for social change and broad partnerships, including with children and adolescents, are needed to deliver results for children. By building on the ‘young reporters’ volunteer activities, UNICEF will further strengthen its communication for social change activities by harnessing the potential of children and youth as agents of change. With support from the Global Volunteer Office, UNICEF will introduce new volunteering activities in the education sector and in communities. Working closely with academic institutions, UNICEF will ensure that advocacy for children’s rights is firmly anchored in economic arguments, includingthrough a planned conference on fiscal and public administration imperatives for early childhood development. UNICEF will also further strengthen partnerships with international and regional financial institutions (the World Bank, Council of Europe Development Bank) and the private sector.

Scaling up the minimum package of services model

Over the past four years, UNICEF in partnership with the National Authority for the Protection of the Rights of the Child and Adoption, Ministry of Labor and Social Justice, Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education, county and local authorities, (supported by Norway Grants and Botnar Foundation) designed and implemented a model for the delivery of integrated services at community level. Implemented in 38 rural and urban municipalities of Bacau County, it covered a total of 45 communities. This ‘minimum package of services’ model provided basic integrated health, social protection and educational services at community level.

These services proved to prevent, at a fraction of the cost, many of the issues that generally affect these families: separating children from their parents, lack of minimum welfare payments, violence, early pregnancy and risky behavior, illness, and school non-enrollment. As part of the model, an innovative technologyplatform was developed and tested, AURORA, which not only allowed for a complete diagnosis of vulnerabilities among children and their families, but also functioned as a tool for integrated case management, monitoring and support planning and policy development. The model created a renewed focus on community level services and their importance for child well-being.

Work is ongoing with mayors and line ministries to ensure sustainability of the investments made and the documentation and experiences of the model, including the mechanisms, protocols, tools, training manuals, are being packaged and made available to the Government of Romania for replication and scale up. Lessons and materials are already being used in a new project replicating in most vulnerable local authorities, leveraging over 20 million Euro from European Union funding. 

The progressive scale up of the model is reflected in several national policy documents, including the national strategy on the protection and promotion of child rights and national strategy on social inclusion and poverty reduction. But access to extra-budgetary resources which could support multi-disciplinary teams and integrated services is not clear, and bureaucratic barriers often hinder the process. 

During the implementation of the model, several lessons learned were documented at local and county level concerning: 1) local specificity and variability; 2) lack of qualified human resources and high turnover; 3) low capacity of community professionals (technical and management); 4) secondary legislation (protocols and guidelines) with a great variety of interpretation and application; 5) limited resources (no standard costs) and 6) administrative authority of the mayoralty.  

At county level, the project documented the following: 1) limited capacity of county coordinators with regards to technical supervision and project management, i.e. focus on quantitative output performance indicators; 2) secondary legislation – protocols and guidelines – with a great variety of interpretation and application and 3) limited resources (no standard costs). 

Additional structural barriers were noted such as: 1) sectoral approach: legislation, institutional framework and funding mechanisms; 2) project approach, 3) weak human resource policies and 4) unconducive social norms and traditional practices at all levels.

Consistent with the strategy to reverse the focus from the most expensive and complicated services to prevention and early intervention the new model will further develop and test the integrated community services center, including specialized services such as ambulatory care, day-care centres, and other community services. The model community services center could serve one or multiple communities, with a clear territorial coverage based on the needs assessment realized in the first stage of modelling. UNICEF Romania will explore the possibility of complementing the physical community services center with onsite services, with a virtual one to provide mobile services, tele-services, and online services. 

Another key lesson learned from the MPS model is that for it to be replicable and sustainable, local governance is key. While a multi-disciplinary and holistic approach to the needs of vulnerable children and their families is essential, municipal planning, management and monitoring needs to connect national priorities with action on the ground, taking account of differentiated needs of vulnerable children within and across rural, peri-urban and urban areas. AURORA with its basic services platform sets the basis for case management, data collection and monitoring, but other e-tools are needed to help make data available for mapping vulnerabilities and planning e.g. around health and social services within and across municipalities.

Further, as part of accountable governance, children and adolescents need to fully be partners and social change agents who help to solve problems in their communities. Taking into consideration their voices and opinions, particularly those of the most vulnerable ones, ensures participation of children in social life and decision making of the municipality, in the living environment and child safety of the municipality, but also their participation vis-à-vis healthcare, education and local development.

Parenting education to reduce school absenteeism

Over the past four years, UNICEF in partnership with the Ministry of Education and HoltIs Association designed and implemented a parenting education component, as part of the quality inclusive education package implemented in 51 school units in Bacau County. The experience accumulated in quality inclusive education implementation and the evidence generated through the external and internal evaluations of the model revealed the benefits of parenting programmes. The average school absences of the children whose parents attended parenting education sessions decreased from 16.2 absences per child to 6.2 absences per child, whereas the partnership between school and parents strengthened, the school culture becoming more family-friendly.

Three important lessons emerged from the implementation of parenting programmes.
Firstly, the education sector has the most robust and sustainable coverage and can act as a vehicle for the delivery of parenting programmes at national level. In rural areas, many communities lack a full-time social worker as well as health services offering full coverage and therefore cannot offer parenting education programmes with sufficient coverage. At the same time, in every community exists at least one school unit where parents can be provided with parenting education. 

Secondly, as exemplified by the ongoing measles outbreak since February 2016, there is a need to use cross-sectoral efforts to reach the most vulnerable parents. Building on the integrated cross-sector teams as part of the community-based services model implemented in Bacau - while the education sector served as the main entry point -messages on parenting reached the most vulnerable when reinforced through the social and child protection and health sectors. 

Lastly, UNICEF Romania demonstrated pathways to raise the percentage of voluntarily trained fathers to 25 per cent. In UNICEF’s previous National Parenting Education Programme in Preschool Education, fathers and grandfathers made up only two to five per cent of the total participants. UNICEF’s strategies to foster paternal involvement revolved around training and involving school principals as parent educators. Ultimately, the delivery of parenting education by the school principal increased the perceived social value and utility of parenting in the community, and thus successfully encouraged the participation of fathers. 

Immunization is not a given

A measles outbreak since February 2016 has affected thousands of people in Romania. Until the end of 2018, 15,600 people contracted the disease according to the National Institute of Public Health in Romania and 59 people have died, the large majority(55) were children. This is a clear indicator that over the years many cohorts of children went unvaccinated, now representing a large pool of teenagers and adults exposed to the disease and who can pass it to infants under nine months old. Although the outbreak abated in late 2018, the risk that the outbreak picks up again remains until immunization levels are increased and reach the WHO-recommended herd immunity of at least 95 per cent across the country to provide adequate protection. 

UNICEF worked with the Ministry of Health, the World Health Organization and the National Institute of Public Health to respond to the outbreak and strengthen the routine vaccination system. This included raising awareness with parents and the general public that vaccines are safe, cost-effective and save lives and creating a national electronic vaccine registry to improve immunization planning and visibility. 

Key lessons learned included the fact that parents need information on where children are vaccinated, especially in communities without general practitioners. Access to community-based health services is key to access health care, but also in view of health promotion.  

Secondly, UNICEF and WHO joined forces to support a Ministry of Health immunization catch-up campaign thattargeteddistricts with the lowest coverage rates to vaccinate children. A door-to-door communication campaign was instrumental, going hand in hand with a team of doctors, nurses and local general practitioners to successfully immunize 95 per cent of the children in these communities.  

Third, to improve coverage rates at national level, the Romanian National 2014-2020 Health Strategy needs a modern, efficient and effective immunization programme using a health-system strengthening approach. For this end, UNICEF Romania is collaborating with the Ministry of Health and National Institute of Public Health, WHO and other partners to develop a costed national implementation plan for immunization, to reach herd immunity for all vaccine-preventable diseases included in the National Programme. 

Finally, the immunization crisis in Romania is another reminder that UNICEF’s successful model of integrated, community-based services, with integrated health teams, for children and families in Bacau county can be referred to as a good practice and should be scaled-up nation-wide.

United Nations country team and operations management team

The United Nations Development Programme does not have an office in Romania, nor is there a Resident Coordinator in place. UNICEF Romania chairs the United Nations country team and leads in interacting with the Government on behalf of United Nations agencies in Romania. The UNICEF Representative is invited by the Government of Romania to represent the United Nations at high-level meetings and visits. The UNICEF Romania operations manager chairs the United Nations operations management team and leads on various United Nations initiatives on behalf of the United Nations, such as cost of living and salary surveys and business operations strategy. 

UNICEF Romania occupies a government-provided rent-free premises shared with United Nations agencies and the Council of Europe, and signed a memorandum of understanding with the Government of Romania for the management of the United Nations House. 

The country office continued its leadership in managing operations as lead United Nations agency in Romania and administrator of United Nations common premises and services, which is unique for UNICEF globally. The UNICEF Romania country office contributed to regional and global initiatives such as the test and pilot of new applications (Vision Hana, Service Now, Budget Formulation Tool); hosting regional inter-government events such as the Conference on Strengthening the Social Work and Social Service Workforce in Europe & Central Asia. Members of the Operations team supported the move of Innocenti Office of Research to new premises and training of administrative staff in the UNICEF Brussels Office.

Private sector fundraising

A fundraising market analysis was carried out in 2018 to support the strategic decisions and investments in local fundraising. A main finding was the limitations of the market potential both for private individuals and companies: the potential number of pledge donors is estimated at 385,000; 6.5 per cent of this estimated potential are already active pledge donors in the UNICEF house file. The potential number of companies that can donate a minimum of US$ 100,000 to UNICEF, applying the 20 per cent fiscal regulation (a facility in the Romanian legislation enabling companies to redirect maximum 20 per cent of their profit tax to a non-profit organization) is estimated at 206. 

Another constraint is related to the labour force. The fundraising market analysis showed that according to a United Nations report 3.4 million Romanians (17 per cent of the population) had left the country between 2007 and 2017, making Romania the country with the second largest emigration rate after Syria. This has a direct impact on recruiting and retaining fundraisers on the team, and thus on funds raised from face-to-face fundraising (which in 2018 generated 59 per cent from the total income from private individuals). 

This points to the need to change the approach of both private individuals and corporates. For private individuals, UNICEF Romania will increasingly create partnerships to recruit; launch a stewardship programme to further engage current pledge donors; and consider a two-step fundraising to help change donor behavior from one-off donations to pledge. 

For corporate, while the strategy “fewer, bigger, better” of the previous country programme proved to be successful, it limited potential on Romania’s market. The more organizations supported, the better coverage they have, which translates into very small grants (2,000-5,000 EUR). UNICEF tested a new approach of corporate direct marketing with limited results so far, but an optimization of the database and of the outreach letter are to be considered for future.  

Despite these challenges UNICEF exceeded its ambitious targets by 20 per cent in 2018.

Partnerships in 2018 presented challenges as well as opportunities, but overall, effective partnerships continued to support the improvement of children lives. Investing more in strategic partnerships and partnership management will require further attention to maximize impact.
The cap on public employment, combined with frequent staff turnover across all sectors, continued to negatively affect the delivery of social services. UNICEF addressed this to some extent by investing in capacity development interventions. This strategy embeds routine capacity strengthening into existing pre-service and in-service training, with the aim of creating a continuum of technical capacity among professionals in these sectors, year after year.

While the Government and line ministries recognize the strategic need for data and evidence-based decision-making, the operationalization and institutionalization of data collection systems requires commitment at different levels of governance. Strong coordination is needed, but sometimes fails due to competing priorities and diverse interests in the long-term planning for data. The upcoming partnership in 2019 with the National Academy of Public Administration may partially fill this gap by ensuring that future civil servants are trained not only on child rights, but also on gathering and analysing data.

Social policy reforms began unfolding in Serbia in 2000, under the overarching narrative of decentralization. During the last 15 years, reforms have been implemented consistently, but slowly and with interruptions at times. However, in 2018 the EU warned that there had been no progress in decentralization or the availability of social protection services at the local level. A number of challenges remain to ensure adequate funding for services, as well as implementation and quality assurance monitoring at a decentralized level.

Serbia remains a country where overseas development assistance is not a contributor to programmes for children, with the exception of a small number of international donors. UNICEF worked to build solid relationships with key international partners – including the EU – to secure additional financial resources to support areas of mutual interest. A key pillar of UNICEF's approach to resource mobilization in Serbia has been to identify where its programme priorities for children best match the broader social development interests of international partners, and to demonstrate how these aspirational goals can be effectively translated into practical progress and results through investment in the UNICEF country programme.

Ensuring longer-term sustainability of initiatives for children is recognized as a challenge in any context with multiple national priorities. A focus on sustainability and scale-up of programmes and services for children and families will be essential as the current programme nears completion. Strong evidence generation on what works and what does not will continue to guide programme adaptation and implementation, to ensure that what is taken to scale is appropriate and sustainable. The costing of programmes will provide the necessary information to Government and partners regarding the investment needed to scale up and sustain results for children. Advocacy for increased financial commitment from the Government will be needed to create the fiscal space for improving access to and quality of services– especially for vulnerable groups and those living in rural and remote communities. To accelerate results for children, UNICEF will also further explore opportunities to develop public–private partnerships.

A strategy for continued attention and growth involves working with the private sector to harness the power of business and markets for children and foster innovation, including business’s networks and capacity for driving change, to seek more innovative and effective solutions. From the resource mobilization side, private sector operations in the office were further strengthened, resulting in doubling the number of pledge donors. Engagement with private sector will remain a priority area in 2019. UNICEF will continue to pursue the use of innovative means for communicating, monitoring programmes and making the voices and power of children and adolescents heard. The priority placed on digitalization by the Government offers multiple opportunities to advance children rights, notably in the field of education; UNICEF will further build on this.

In a financially constrained environment such as is Serbia, it is understandable that investment in child development should be linked to a clear fiscal framework. For this reason, UNICEF will prioritize cost-benefit analysis across sectors in future advocacy priorities, particularly when increased public expenditure is needed to fulfil children rights. Looking ahead, UNICEF Serbia will place stronger emphasis on public finance for children and consider the inclusion of sustainability costings in the scope of pilot programmes, so that a focus on the longer-term investment needed to scale up successful programmes is included from the inception phase.

Changing behaviours and social norm is a long-term and complex process that requires investment not only in intensive and repetitive messaging and dialogue, but also to ensure the availability of services and a supportive environment. Lack of access to services or inadequate service provision combined with incomplete information can breed resentment and mistrust, leading to rumours and misconceptions and further fuelling discrimination. In this regard, UNICEF will need to invest in further efforts in coming years.

External communication activities allowed UNICEF to pass along important advocacy messages and strengthen its positioning in key reform areas. Activities organized by UNICEF for World Children’s Day in 2018 confirmed the great leveraging potential of these special events. Schools, the private sector and national institutions responded to UNICEF’s appeal to engage, and the anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child did not pass unnoticed. The year 2019 will mark 30 years since the adoption of the Convention, giving UNICEF an opportunity to make the voices of children heard at the national level throughout the year, and also to engage in more sustainable partnerships with local actors.

Finally, in the framework of UN coherence, the need for more frequent dialogue among agencies on progress and perspectives is crucially needed. Increased frequency will allow for improved analysis of cooperation opportunities and a stronger appreciation of results against the United Nations development assistance framework. Going forward, UNICEF Serbia views UN Reform as an opportunity to further embed children’s rights in the UN narrative and action.

Water and sanitation for children remains a major concern in Tajikistan, with many development partners focusing on water policy and infrastructure as priorities, while 42 per cent of the infant mortality rate caseload is attributed to lack of water and sanitation at a community level. UNICEF Tajikistan phased out of WASH programming at the mid-term review of the previous country programme (2010-2015), and no new partner has emerged locally to fill in the WASH gap in education or the health sector (for example, maternity wards), especially on WASH soft programming.  

There are very real challenges in building and maintaining functioning latrines in schools and hospitals. This gap in both the soft component and infrastructure has a negative impact on delivering results in areas of health (specifically maternal, newborn and child health) and nutrition. Following a call by development partners and the Government during the mid-term review, and the analysis of service gaps in hospitals and schools, UNICEF Tajikistantook the decision to restart a WASH programme. It based programming priorities on lessons learned, as well as concerns flagged in the design and sustainability of the previous country programme. 

New opportunities emerged to further engage and position UNICEF Tajikistan more strategically vis-à-vis the development sphere in Tajikistan, especially considering the momentum created from the Government commitment to nationalizing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the overall 2030 agenda, as well as the urgent and substantive action required to follow-up on the recently submitted Concluding Observations of the Committee on the Right of the Child (September 2017). In this context, the Commission on Child Rights and UNICEF are jointly developing the national Sustainable Development Goal programme for children extending through the lifespan of the Goals, to accelerate the achievement of results for girls and boys with integrated and comprehensive policy planning and budgeting process, setting key targets/indicators, securing financing, and fulfilling obligations under the Convention. This repositioning requires significant cross-sectoral evidence-based planning, as well as identifying new models of financing. 

Financing for children is a priority due to economic constraints that are expected to continue to affect government spending on child-related programmes and services. Value-for-money advocacy becomes increasingly important in a resource-constrained context. Budgetary limitations and decreasing the international donor portfolio may jeopardize sustained results for children. UNICEF Tajikistan strives to strengthen engagement in public finance management with focus on efficiency and effectiveness of services and programmes for children and their families. Several costing exercises helped national stakeholders better understand financial implications of proposed policies and political decisions. However, a proper budgeting exercise is not a mandatory prerequisite to development of any policy document in the country. Furthermore, the level of understanding of costing models is very low and the national capacity for budgeting is weak. There is not a sufficient connection between costing and financing. Thus, costing results are not utilized at the level where they could contribute to policy-making. UNICEF continued investing in capacity development on broader public finance for children issues such as programme-based and participatory budgeting and value-for-money analyses.  

The social sector will remain fiscally strained in the coming years, primarily due to the Government’s prioritization to allocate funds to the energy sector, in particular to the construction of the Rogun hydropower plant, with the goal to minimize the import of electricity and to generate revenues through the export of electricity to neighbouring countries. UNICEF Tajikistan advocacy for more efficient budget implementation and to re-prioritize investment within the available budget envelope will be a more realistic approach by decision-makers such as the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Economic Development and Trade and sectoral ministries. Obtaining budget data both from the Ministry of Finance and the sectoral ministries proved to be challenging. Concerning data on children, the challenge is exacerbated by the fact that disaggregation by age is technically difficult. In 2018, UNICEF Tajikistan improved its collaboration with the Ministry of Finance and sectoral ministries in order to jointly embark on the analysis of the public spending and budget efficiency exercise within the framework of developing a national SDG programme for children.  

Public financial management initiatives are a platform to engage with public policy formulation and budgeting for children. The roles of development partners and international financial institutions are crucial in financing for children in Tajikistan. UNICEF Tajikistan will enhance its cooperation with international financial institutions, building on efforts that have mobilized resources for children. The CCR and UNICEF began national-level consultations on a national SDG programme for children in late 2018, which can serve as a solid platform for engagement with development partners and international financial institutions.  

The quality of services in the social sector is another critical area for UNICEF Tajikistan. The model of health service delivery and the patient health care pathways between rural and urban areas continue to create inequity. Typically, urban population have access to higher levels, and often better quality, of care without referral from the primary care level. Gate-keeping at primary care level, poor integration of primary and secondary care, and gaps in post- specialist or post-hospital care impedes timeliness and access to needed care, as well as follow-up treatment by primary care providers, especially in rural areas.  

Health-facility infrastructure suffered from years of under-investment; technology and equipment are often obsolete. It is not uncommon for rural health facilities to lack electricity, adequate water and sanitation facilities and functional washing points with water and soap. Consequently, infection-prevention measures were poorly followed, resulting in preventable neonatal morbidity and mortality and discouraging care-seeking and service utilization by pregnant women.  

Health care in Tajikistan suffered from ‘brain drain’ phenomenon, as health workers seek higher wages abroad. This, coupled with the high turnover of health care workers, hampers sustainability of capacity-building results, suggesting a need for a continuous education curriculum for healthcare providers and for supportive supervision of the healthcare worker.  

While the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of the Population recognized the challenge of improving quality of care, embarking on the revision of existing clinical protocols, gaps remain in adherence to protocols and guidelines by health care practitioners. Fears of confidentiality breaches exist and as a result, clients’ refusal to give consent for transfer of their cases hampers optimal integration of such things as HIV/AIDS prevention or treatment into primary health care.  

Another major concern in health service provision is poor and limited adolescent-friendly services and psychological support. On the one hand, services are not tailored to the needs of adolescents and young people, while on the other, the capacity of health personnel to provide care to adolescents is limited and requires continuous investment. UNICEF Tajikistan is addressing some of the identified gaps, but there is a need for greater investment in the knowledge of health professionals on adolescent psychology.  

To address quality gaps of health care at policy level, UNICEF supported evidence generation, the development of policies, tools protocols, guidelines, cross sectoral results framework and the budgeting of packages of care that would objectively influence policy formulation and would benchmark services quality. At a service-provision level, UNICEF Tajikistan assisted in the procurement and provision of essential equipment, vaccines, integrated management of childhood illness’ medication, cold chain equipment, Vitamin A and therapeutic food for the treatment of acute malnutrition. Capacity-building for health care workers, school psychologists, administration and officials needs to be a part of continuous quality improvement system.  

Regarding adolescent friendly services, support is needed to raise awareness to create demand for services. The inclusion of adolescent health topics in the pre- and in-service training curriculum of health care workers and teachers would facilitate sustainability and longer-term availability for adolescent health services.  

Despite improved access, the education system is still beset with quality issues. In recent years, the Ministry of Education and Science supported by development partners and multilateral organizations, such as the Global Partnership for Education and the European Union, improved the quality of education through the adoption of competency-based curriculum, the improvement of learning materials and the overall enhancement of school infrastructure. However, poor quality of instruction is still prevalent, especially in rural areas. There is a prevailing failure to attract, train and retrain qualified and motivated teaching personnel. As a result, the education system is failing to equip boys and girls with relevant skills for their future life and employment.  

To fulfil children’s right to education, UNICEF Tajikistan facilitated a dialogue with development partners which led to the agreement with the European Union to support development of a new Education Sector Plan 2021-2030 aligned to the national priorities and the SDG agenda. The focus of the Plan will be to improve equity, efficiency and learning outcomes at all levels of education. As a coordinating agency for the Global Partnership for Education, UNICEF leveraged almost US$70 million to secure funding for education reforms.  

In Tajikistan, the national data management system remains fragmented with limited access to quality, disaggregated data. Data production and data supply are mismatched. Though localization of the SDGs has become a beacon for national development, action plans and strategies across sectors lack proper targets and indicators. Disaggregated data in general, and on vulnerabilities in particular, is lacking. The availability of reliable, disaggregated and regularly collected government data on children and adolescents remains a major challenge in the country. Ability to conduct timely monitoring, data collection and reporting is impeded by limited capacity on the ground and a punitive culture in which data that is not considered as ‘favourable’ is dismissed or questioned (including official data) and which results in the absence of systematic, harmonized approach to data analysis and use. The process of data clearance takes time that limits its use as evidence for policy decisions. Capacity-building efforts are hampered by high turnover, low salaries and a poor performance management system, as well as the discouragement of real accountability and transparency in data sharing.  

UNICEF Tajikistan continued to monitor the situation of children through alternative data collection systems such as “Listening to Tajikistan”, a monthly real-time monitoring survey conducted by the World Bank, and through the food security monitoring survey conducted twice a year by the World Food Programme. UNICEF engaged in development of a vulnerability atlas based on the secondary data at the district level to help target interventions to reach the most marginalized. The Atlas is pending final approval by the Government. UNICEF contributed to the Demographic and Health Survey (2017) by introducing the module on child discipline, one of the few child-related indicators in Multiple Indicator Survey Cluster modules missing from the DHS. Further efforts by UNICEFTajikistan in evidence and knowledge agenda will focus on supporting the country in developing a robust child rights monitoring framework, as recommended by the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child.  

In addition, UNICEF Tajikistan, as a (co-)custodian of 17 SDG indicators, champions the SDG  agenda for children with a focus on resourcing, planning and monitoring. Support to national partners to localization the SDG targets will contribute to collaboration with Ministry of Economic Development and Trade (in charge of planning, Sustainable Development Goals, the National Development Strategy and United Nations Development Assistance Framework) that is responsible for the SDG reporting.

ECAR,Türkiye,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
2018 was the third year of implementation of the Turkey-UNICEF Country Programme 2016-2020. Towards the end of the year, UNICEF Turkey embarked on a programme review, which entailed a comprehensive reflection on the implementation so far based on available evidence, internal discussions and consultations with partners. The following paragraphs draw on the lessons that have emerged from this process, as well as on experiences in 2018.

The overall aim and logic of the country programme remain relevant. It has continued to form a sound basis for UNICEF’s cooperation with a wide variety of partners in effectively addressing a range of child rights issues. However, the dynamic context in the country has required fine-tuning and shifts in some areas.

Cross-sectoral programming including adolescents and out-of-school children
The Turkey-UNICEF Country Programme 2016-2020 emphasizes integration and cross-sectoral linkages. It adopts a cross-sectoral approach within which outcomes are not defined along sectoral lines. Instead, cross-sectoral results groups were established for each programme outcome. The programme also identified promoting inter-sectoral cooperation as a key strategy for achieving results, alongside supporting national capacity, making available the best technical knowledge, and partnering with a wide range of stakeholders.

In practice, UNICEF Turkey has increased its joint work across sectors, and the benefits have been apparent in areas such as support for multi-service centres, engaging with different sectors to prevent child marriage, and integrating a child protection component into the conditional cash transfer for education. Nevertheless, it is felt that cross-sectoral implementation could be strengthened in parts of the country programme by approaching the target groups of children in a more integrated manner or involving a wider range of potential stakeholders.

One lesson learned, therefore, was the need to streamline internal coordination mechanisms further and enable more systematic cross-sectoral work. This would also be in line with the call for cross-sectoral and multi-sectoral programming that responds holistically to children’s needs underlined under the programming at scale results for children strategy defined in the UNICEF global Strategic Plan 2018-2021.

This need for a more cross-sectoral and integrated approach is most pressing in certain programmatic areas that have been identified as renewed priorities during the programme review – early childhood development, adolescents, and out-of-school children. Addressing the child rights issues affecting these vulnerable groups of children requires an integrated approach to tackle the multiple bottlenecks and barriers that span different sectors and stakeholders.

Early childhood development is a global priority for UNICEF, and an increasing development priority for the Government. ECD programming has continued during the current cycle with a focus on early childhood education and strengthening the systems for early identification of disabilities and development delays. However, implementation of activities has been managed within the relevant sections, with perhaps insufficient attention to the more multi-sectoral and policy-related bottlenecks, including the need for a more comprehensive national ECD policy and more inter-sectoral coordination. Competing priorities and a limited focus on discrete initiatives can constitute a constraint to an evidence-based, integrated, cross-sectoral approach both in the country and within UNICEF Turkey. 

Several issues mainly affecting adolescents are being addressed under the country programme with various degrees of cross-sectoral integration and coordination. These include work in the areas of justice for children, cash transfers, child marriage, and child labour. However, more coordination and integration are required for the many activities within programme sections which are currently focusing on the common target group of most vulnerable adolescents. Otherwise, the discreteness of these programme components may result in a failure to address common bottlenecks and issues, such as family poverty, social norms and questions of mental wellbeing. Narrowly-focused initiatives may also see adolescents as objects rather than subjects and fail to promote their participation, foster their creativity or support them in developing and implementing their own initiatives. A more comprehensive, evidence-based and holistic approach to adolescents would correspond well to the newly-released UNICEF Programme Guidance for the Second Decade as well as the Generation Unlimited and the priority focus on adolescents reflected in the Strategic Plan 2018-21. 

The non-participation of children in education is another issue which mainly faces adolescents. The reasons why children of various backgrounds and genders are out of school are diverse and cannot solely be tackled through programmatic work and partnerships in the education sector. Once again, there may be scope for more holistic and coordinated action as well as linking the issue more rigorously to the wider adolescent agenda. 

As a result of this reflection on cross-sectoral ways of working, UNICEF Turkey is renewing its coordination mechanisms and revising the terms of reference of the Results Groups, to be incorporated into the 2019 Annual Management Plan. The office decided to refine existing theories of change for ECD, out-of-school-children and adolescents, to better spell out the integrated strategic approaches beyond what is already foreseen for these groups of children in the sectoral theories of change. This exercise will help improve existing cross-sectoral programming and will feed into the preparation of the new Turkey-UNICEF Country Programme. 

Humanitarian action, integrated programming, and social cohesion
The country programme was designed to contribute to reducing the equity gaps affecting the most vulnerable boys and girls living in Turkey. This means realising the rights of a large number of refugee children from Syria and other countries at the same time as addressing the unfinished agenda for those groups of Turkish children who have not benefitted as much as others from the socio-economic progress and improvements in most child-related indicators in the country.

The refugee crisis caused by the conflict in Syria was still escalating when the country programme was developed. Since then the scale of the crisis has continued to increase, making Turkey the country with the largest registered refugee population in the world for the past three years. Nevertheless, given the strong national capacities and leadership in responding to the crisis, the country programme document was written with a close eye on the humanitarian-development nexus and the emerging resilience agenda as well as a focus on working with and through national systems. 

This approach, which dovetails with the 3RP, has proven successful and was sustained in 2018. For example, it has enabled UNICEF to support community-based services that are open to refugee children as well as members of host communities, to use inclusion in national systems to quickly scale up support to vulnerable families, as was done with the extension of the CCTE to refugees. It has also allowed UNICEF to pursue an integrated approach to addressing child labour and child marriage, issues which affect both the refugee and Turkish communities. UNICEF Turkey has also scaled up its work in social cohesion, focusing on adolescents and young people as agents of change to promote meaningful interaction and mutual understanding between communities. 

The fact remains that addressing the pressing needs of such an unprecedented number of refugee children has required many actors, including UNICEF, to support the large-scale and visible delivery of basic services specifically for these children. As the protracted nature of the Syria crisis continues to strain resources and infrastructure at the local level, and with some evidence of shifting and increasingly negative perceptions of refugees among local communities, both the Government of Turkey and humanitarian actors are increasingly prioritizing the need to promote tolerance and build social cohesion among different groups and layers of society. 

In this respect, UNICEF Turkey became increasingly aware in 2018 of the need for a more clearly articulated conceptual framework to guide its approach to building social cohesion. At the same time, clearer areas of focus and entry points where UNICEF and its partners can have an impact needed to be identified. Accordingly, in 2019 UNICEF will define a clearer strategy and focus for the future work in the area of social cohesion.

Sustainability
UNICEF’s comparative advantage in an upper middle-income country such as Turkey generally lies not in its ability to mobilise resources and support the delivery of basic services, since these capacities are already available in-country. Rather, UNICEF contributes to the well-being of children by deploying its expertise through ‘upstream’ strategies such as evidence-based advocacy, systems strengthening for quality and inclusion, the transfer of innovations and the latest global knowledge, and the promotion of international cooperation and exchanges.

Nevertheless, the numbers of refugee children that national systems and services have had to absorb have strained Turkey’s capacities in certain respects and called for additional support as well as increased solidarity from the international community. As part of the UN system, and in line with its Core Commitments for Children, UNICEF has significantly scaled up its presence in Turkey and responded through a series of strategies including direct support for service delivery, both through national systems and non-governmental partners, as well as capacity-building and technical assistance. 

As part of the programme review, reflections began on approaches and strategies to ensure that the results of UNICEF Turkey’s work in response to the refugee crisis can be sustained even in the event of a decline in international solidarity. Lessons learned from other countries and contexts show that this post-humanitarian transition process can bring risks to children’s well-being and UNICEF’s reputation if not properly managed. In Turkey, these risks will be lower than in other countries, given the strong leadership and investment of the Government in the crisis since the beginning, and the fact that UNICEF’s assistance has already evolved to include and emphasise the strengthening of systems to benefit both refugee and Turkish children. 

In response to these issues, UNICEF Turkey will continuously seek to diversify its sources of funding, identify the most cost-effective and long-term partners for programme implementation, consider more multi-sectoral and geographic convergence of existing community-based activities, and sharpen the focus and selectivity of its programming – for example, with respect to training activities. Advocacy will continue to complete the integration of UNICEF-supported activities into national and local government systems and budgets, taking account of beneficiary needs. New modalities will be explored for cooperation with public institutions, particularly municipalities, as well as with the private sector. In addition, UNICEF Turkey will adjust and reinforce its technical capacities, procedures and partnerships in line with the anticipated shift in its roles. 

Public financing for children
Following on from the above, one constraint which UNICEF Turkey identified was its limited engagement and capacity in the area of public finance for children. UNICEF programming in this area has become common in other middle-income countries that have greater capacities to find fiscal space and fund large-scale national programmes for children, as well as to institutionalize such programmes into a well-developed national portfolio of services. In the case of Turkey, however, this area remains relatively unexplored at this stage.

At a time when reviewing programme costs and the feasibility of various public financing options under different scenarios is essential to facilitate the post-humanitarian transition and to ensure the sustainability of the results achieved for children, the need for UNICEF to be meaningfully engaged, together with other actors, in policy discussions that relate to public finance for children has become urgent. 

UNICEF Turkey has identified public finance for children as an emerging priority, notwithstanding a likely temporary contraction in fiscal space in 2019 as a result of the current economic situation. In preparation for the next country programme cycle, UNICEF Turkey therefore intends to build its expertise in this field and explore the possibility of engaging on priority issues in the short term. Meanwhile, more importantly, it will seek to build new partnerships and expand the scope of its existing dialogue with relevant national entities in such a way as to contribute to policy discussions from the perspective of public finance for children in the medium and longer term.

More systematic documentation
UNICEF Turkey has made substantial efforts to progressively expand the country programme. The financial throughput has tripled from US$56 million in 2015 to approximately US$181 million in 2018. UNICEF has continuously monitored and adapted to changes in the operating environment. This situation of controlled but rapid growth in the last three years has resulted in strong results on implementation and risk management, but with less time available to reflect comprehensively and document how the priorities and strategies have evolved.

At the same time, several external observers have indicated that the country programme has been using programming approaches that could be better documented as innovative solutions and/or good practices. Examples of this include the application of the humanitarian-development nexus and the integration of a cash transfer programme with a child protection programme linked with national services delivery systems. 

It has thus become apparent once again that priority needs to be attached to assessing the relevance and achievements of the work undertaken, and documenting the achievements, good practices and lessons learned more systematically, in order to allow for learning at the organizational and country level. 

Several upcoming evaluations and documentation exercises will address this priority. These will include the ongoing Evaluation of Community-Based Child Protection Services and Evaluation of the Response to the Syria Refugee Crisis in the Education Sector, as well as the Country Programme Evaluation and the Evaluation of Conditional Cash Transfers in Education, both of which are scheduled for 2019.

Looking ahead
During the programme review, UNICEF Turkey has identified a number of areas in which lessons have been learned or constraints have arisen in 2018. It has also specified some potential solutions in terms of its own procedures and strategic thinking. The review was still ongoing at the end of 2018, with discussions with government partners. During this process, additional issues may be identified and/or responses agreed. Major changes in the structure of the current country programme are not anticipated, but some changes could be made in the way in which it is being implemented, and some adjustments to outputs or indicators.The report of the programme review and the ongoing discussions with partners will also be considered during preparations for the development of the next country programme, which will commence in 2019.

ECAR,Turkmenistan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
The Evaluation of Turkmenistan’s National Nutrition Programme for 2013-2017, finalized in early 2018, included lessons learned and documented Turkmenistan’s progress in nutrition indicators such as exclusive breastfeeding. The evaluation had implications concerning the positive leadership of the Ministry of Health and Medical Industry that created a favourable environment for complementarity and cross-sectorial work by key stakeholders. The evaluation established that the National Nutrition Programme lacked a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) strategy to measure impact, outcome and output indicators, which limited partners’ ability to assess the progress achieved during the implementation. 

Those observations cut across most of the national plans and strategies and supported the recommendation of the 2018 Mainstreaming, Acceleration Policy Support report to enhance the strategic planning capacity for better SDG implementation and monitoring. In the area of nutrition, in 2018 UNICEF supported the Government in developing a monitoring and evaluation system for a nutrition programme, which was expected to be adopted in early 2019. UNICEF also helped establish sentinel sites for monitoring some of the important nutrition indicators through routine data collection. 

The strategic moment of reflection confirmed that there had been little progress toward current country programme document targets related to public finance management, which in the longer run, may put at risk the scaling up and acceleration of the work for children. This can primarily be explained by the country’s relatively weak institutional capacity in results-based management and budgeting. The linkage between high-level public finance management results of the country programme document and planned outputs was weak, exacerbated by the lack of devoted human resources to take the public finance management agenda forward. The strategic moment of reflection established that UNICEF needed to reinforce its capacity and presence in public finance management with, at least, a national specialist. Recruitment for the position was underway at year end. UNICEF initiated a dialogue and a workplan with the Ministry of Finance and Economy. UNICEF also began to develop an operational plan for introducing one-year universal pre-primary education. This move would support the implementation of the Committee on the Rights of the Child concluding observations related to budget analysis and allocations for children, and support the capacities of line ministries in public finance management and outcome-based budget formulation. Progress in this area will not be quick or straightforward. 

The current country programme focuses on early childhood development and children with disabilities, as well as on addressing high childhood/neonatal mortality rates and reducing risks and vulnerabilities of children with developmental delays.  UNICEF Turkmenistan documented its support for the establishment of multi-disciplinary teams for early identification/early intervention. This documentation is also necessary because the work in the area does not and cannot fully meet the conditions expected from pilots. It is important to take stock, identify opportunities and bottlenecks for going to programming at scale and acceleration of progress. In 2019 this exercise will inform the evaluability assessment for a potential evaluation of Turkmenistan’s early childhood development policy. 

Scaling up multi-disciplinary support services for children with disabilities and their families, strengthening an inter-sectoral referral system and further promotion of inclusive education were constrained by the lack of childcare professionals with required competencies and/or absence of professionals of the core childcare disciplines required for multi-disciplinary support (psychologists, speech, physical and occupational therapists, developmental paediatricians, inclusive pedagogues). UNICEF took proactive steps to establish bridges with the State Medical University to initiate early childhood development courses for primary health care workers, paediatricians and child neurologists. Social work specialization was initiated at the college level. In general, there is a need to adopt a systematic approach to human resources development in the social sector and step up UN coordination and support, particularly in the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and introduction of social services. 

The strategic moment of reflection highlighted that while it was important to continue scaling up promising current initiatives, examining long-term transformational initiatives was equally vital. UNICEF Turkmenistan therefore started to engage in longer-term planning and scenario building exercises, including the development of plans and roadmaps for some medium-term results for children. These included introduction of universal pre-primary education, introduction of social work profession and education and health management information systems. The planning exercises indicated that some of the results targeted to be achieved by the end of 2020 can in the best-case scenario only be attained after another country programme of cooperation.

ECAR,Ukraine,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Along with the achievements noted above, 2018 had its share of challenges that affected the planned results and limited UNICEF’s  impact on child well-being. The conflict in Eastern Ukraine and the macro–economic instability posed considerable challenges and affected the pace and effectiveness of all  reforms, including those in social sectors. 

Ukraine continued to pursue an ambitious reform agenda covering all sectors directly influencing child well-being, including health care, education, decentralization, social protection and justice, among others. A number of constraints hampered the attainment of expected results. 

Major transformations in social sectors coincided with parallel territorial reforms and decentralization of responsibilities to sub-national level. This overlap hampered major focus, guidance and support to be provided by local authorities and created multiple pressing needs on service deliveries at decentralized level. 

Limited communication between national and regional/local administrations on the longer-term impact of the proposed changes resulted in some confusion and ultimately distrust in the Government-led reforms by a wide array of stakeholders, including the general public.

The capacity of government institutions to manage change and run large-scale reforms was limited, especially at municipal level. At best, the Government exercised the ‘normative role’, but it cannot provide sufficient guidance and the support required for coordination, demand generation and capacity development.

Because of limited communication on reforms, public demand for equitable investments in children was insufficient. This affected the reforms related to inclusive education and de-institutionalization. 

The presidential and parliamentary elections, scheduled respectively for March and September 2019, were already casting a shadow on the routine work of government institutions. This was most pronounced in cases where officials held diverging political views or agendas.

This pre-election period could also bring a number of ‘populistic’ expenditures that, in turn, would limit the opportunities for other expenditures. There is a risk of politicians transferring stat’ obligations (including existing unfunded mandates) to local authorities without adequate financing. The burden on social protection units is likely to remain high as the expected increase of the natural gas prices (a critical IMF conditionality) requires to maintain/if not to increase a largescale ‘subsidy’ programme.

Despite the significant international support provided to humanitarian and recovery interventions in conflict affected areas of Eastern Ukraine, critical public infrastructure, including educational, health and social facilities, lacked major financial investments from central government. This calls for increased technical support from partners, enhanced coordination among actors and further advocacy with government, including through humanitarian clusters.

Humanitarian access remained an overall concern, in particular for the non-government controlled areas and in areas near the contact line (0-15 km zone) due to ongoing hostilities and the heavy presence of mines and ERWs. Closure of checkpoints caused delays for timely implementation of programme activities and related travels. The design of UNICEF’s new country programme anticipated some of those challenges. Sub-offices located near the contact line effectively monitored the situation of children and women and responded quickly. The UNICEF office in Kyiv provided back up support to those operations as well as technical aid and financial assistance and strategic guidance, including liaison with UN and other development partners. 

At national level,  UNICEF effectively engaged with line ministries in key strategic reform areas. The Child and Youth-Friendly City Initiative enabled UNICEF to position child rights issues in the debate on reforms and to strengthen children’s participation. The success of model municipalities and cities in formulating a budget for integrated social services offers an opportunity to address major gapsin the decentralization process identified by the local authorities. 

System strengthening within the framework of the reforms became a key strategy and entry point for UNICEF across all areas of work. UNICEF combined its national level system strengthening support with a sub-national level modelling of new approaches for child focused service delivery, with the intent of further horizontal scale-up, implementing a systemic response. In Eastern Ukraine, UNICEF also continued to build capacity of local authorities and civil society organizations in providing quality services aimed at strengthening resilience and building social cohesion around children, further strengthening the nexus between humanitarian aid and development assistance.

Throughout 2018, UNICEF entered into new, high-level partnerships that supported advocacy efforts on  child rights. In child and youth friendly cities andjustice for children programmes, UNICEF engaged with the Prime Ministerand Deputy Prime Ministers and facilitated several inter-ministerial fora that resulted in enhanced inter-sectoral coordination and increased visibility and attention in the respective areas. 

Fundraising for the humanitarian sector remained challenging. UNICEF Ukraine carefully reviewed its resource mobilization strategy for 2019 with a view to craft a refined and more successful strategy. The new strategy targets proposals to specific donors and also aims to reach out to new partners, including in the private sector.

ESAR,Angola,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Lessons learned

Lesson 1: Public financing for children (PF4C)
Angola is in the process of graduating from low income country status by 2021. UNICEF Angola has contributed to improve the country’s human capital and address povertywith focus on advocacy to increase public budget allocation for children. The Public Financing for Children (PF4C) agenda was advanced with a comprehensive advocacy strategy and the strategic leveraging of resources for social sectors.  

In 2018, an additional increment of almost US$ 400 million was allocated for health and education. UNICEF led the budget analysis, dissemination and advocacy in close coordination with civil society partners (ADRA, MOSAIKO and OPSA). Civil society organisations’involvement was essential for widening the debate, including at sub-national level, reaching different segments of society. Media was critical throughout the process. There was an enhanced engagement of social sectors ministries, Ministry of Finance and Parliament. Work included the production of the analysis; discussion with the national ministerial departments in charge of studies, planning and statistics (GEPE); validation with the Ministry of Finance; an official launch with high-level participation from the Government, parliament and donors; implementation of a media strategy to give visibility to the issue and amplify the public debate; and targeted dissemination with key stakeholders, including specific MPs of the Social Commission; 

The most important lessons learned from the experience included: (a) the alignment of the general state budget analysis with the OGE submission to the parliament allowed changes in the state budget in real time; and (b) engagement of the GEPEs reinforced involvement of the sectoral ministries in the budget proposal and analysis, generating data and evidence for increased budget allocation advocacy.  

A major constraint to the PF4C agenda was the limited access to information on budget execution, to allow for a thorough analysis. In 2019, UNICEF and partners will seek to gain access to information on spending. Additionally, engagement with the parliament and GEPEs will be enhanced and closer collaboration with the World Bank and International Monetary Fundwill be sought. 

Lesson 2: Integrated, multi-sectoral/convergent modelling
UNICEF has developed integrated, convergent programme models for quality and efficient service delivery that are ready to be, or are being, replicated by Government. The main lesson learned is the fact that when the models are contextualized to the municipal level, and are cost efficientwith quality service delivery, the Government and partners will be able to absorb, replicate and scale them.  

For example:
a) The integrated social action centers are a model piloted with UNICEF support in six municipalities of three provinces, which the Government is currently expanding and replicating in several municipalities of Luanda. The model can bolster the response to the huge demand for more modern, decentralized social protection services (described in greater detail in Goal Area 5). 

b) In Huíla province, with a relatively small investment there were substantial results in the WASH and education sectors when working both sides of the humanitarian development nexus (more details in lesson fivebelow), specifically integrating and converging early childhood development, nutrition and back-to-school. The model is also being replicated in the province of Cunene. 

c) As a result of modelling and budget advocacy work, the community-led total sanitation approach (described in detail in Goal Area 4) was formally included in the National Development Plan 2018-2022. 

Notwithstanding the constraints typical of the early stages of model implementation, in particular the challenge to ensure sustainability and domestic resource mobilization, looking ahead, UNICEF Angola’s in-depth work at the sub-national levels will maximize the opportunities to enhance community engagement aspects of the National Development Plan, particularly with youth and adolescents. 

Lesson 3: Innovation and social transformation
Data from the Demographic Health Survey 2016 indicate that in Angola less than 25 per cent of children are registered before their fifthyear, and among the main barriers is unfulfilled fatherhood. To address this barrier, a national campaign supported by UNICEF was tailored to feature responsible fatherhood in promoting gender equality in Angola. The initiative had strong buy-in from the Minister of Justice and Human Rights. With a potential to reach 20 million people, “Responsible Fatherhood: I am in!” engaged influencers including celebrities, mass and social media, the national federation of football, and leaders of two National Taxi Drivers Associations to engage over 20,000 “candongueiros” (blue taxi vans) and thousands of passengers every day. In its first phase, the initiative andinfluencers engage Angolan men with their responsibility as fathers, and to register the birth of their children. 

The initiative was strategically launched to support the birth registration policy in health facilities, a partnership between the Ministries of Justice and Health. The model was introduced with UNICEF support to offer innovative services for free access to civil registration immediately after birth, and is gradually being scaled-up nationwide by the Government. With UNICEF advocacy and leveraging, a partnership between the Ministry of Education and Justice will establishbirth registration services in schools, addressing the backlog of unregistered school children. 

As a primary lesson, audience acceptance and positive campaign results can suggest alternatives to entrenched social norms and gender roles. Baselines on behaviours were established in 2018 to measure changes in social and gender norms by end of 2019 as a result of the initiative. 

Lesson 4: Coordination platforms
An important lesson to note was that with its convening role to leverage partnerships, resources and investmentfor children, UNICEF Angola can position itself as a key strategic partner beyond traditional social sectors (such as health, education, WASH). In Angola, this includes non-typical Government partners such as the Ministries of Finance, State Reform and Administration, Youth, Social Communication, Interior, Social Security and Labour, and the Presidency. 

UNICEF initiated partnerships with the private sector, starting with raising awareness for specific programmatic causes, such as promotion of a child rights’ package through the Internet of Good Things platform. In 2019, UNICEF Angola will strengthen engagement with private sector and civil society (e.g. community-based organizations, youth groups, religious, sports and other social organizations) and continue to explore strategic partnerships and alliances for advocacy; resource mobilization; leveraging; and to bring new partners to advance the child rights agenda in Angola. 

Lesson 5: Humanitarian development nexus
The response to multiple emergency situations required combined but differing approaches, focusing torespondto the immediate needs of the affected populations, while also promoting prevention and building resilience by providing services that address their development needs. With the refugee response, for example, the approach incorporated providing services to both the refugee population and the host communities, whichrequiredflexibility with and adaptation of the response in line with the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework and other guidelines. Key lessons of the UNICEF Angola approach to strengthen the humanitarian development nexus included:

a) In 2018, water and sanitation systems were strengthened for both the refugees and the host communities, specifically in Lunda Norte provinces, while in Uíge province the support assisted both the cholera affected and non-affected neighbourhoods. Communication for Development for WASH along with a community-led total sanitation approach was used to reach the affected populations as well as thehost or neighbour(and not-affected) communities; 

b) In the emergency context, refugee children were able to attend regular schools in Lunda Norte province. Teachers were trained and deployed to the refugee settlement, as well as to the schools in the host community; 

c) In the refugee response, where health systems are generally weak, the need for nutrition wards was evident and they were established for both refugees and host communities in the existing municipal health facilities, to respond to malnutrition. 

The overall lesson is that UNICEF Angola effectively linked emergency work with development progress, leveraging resources and building communityand institution’s resilience. This included the willingness to use emergency funds to reinforce the local systems. In order to achieve this result, high level advocacy for both sides of the nexus was conducted. 

To note that Angola is prone to multiple and simultaneous emergencies, including a chronic silent nutrition crisis, which raises a number of challenges, namely: 

(a) A difficult landscape for resource mobilization, as demonstrated from the Humanitarian Action for Children appeal which generated limited funds; two interagency appeals for the refugee response which ultimately did not generate contributions for UNICEF in Angola; and an unsuccessful effort toallocate a portion of a Central Emergency Response Fund, which resulted in a severely under-funded emergency contribution through the United Nationsin Angola, in particular to support life-saving nutrition services in drought-affected provinces. A 77 per cent funding gaplimited UNICEF Angola’s capacity to respond to the needs of refugee children, and the Angolan women and children who are at risk of water-borne diseases and malnutrition;  

(b) The limited qualified humanitarian actors,with presence at local level; 

(c) The weak capacity and limited presence of civil society organisations, and limited coordination between all partners involved in the responses,were challenges to prepare, prevent and respond to humanitarian situations.

There has also been the recurring constraint with the lack of gender sensitivity in terms of planning and preparedness. However looking ahead, the opportunity exists to improve this aspect, especially the emergency contingency plans in the education and other sectors, which will better protect children and women in Angola in 2019.




"
ESAR,Botswana,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
UNICEF Botswana has identified five lessons learned and constraints with respect to our work in 2018. 

First, having implemented upstream activities (technical support to policy and legislation) and downstream efforts (community-level proofs of concept) for two years, UNICEF determined that both types of support are relevant in Botswana. Thus, the original theory of change that presented the value of using both approaches remain intact. In 2019, UNICEF Botswana will continue to navigate between approaches to ensure that children’s lives are improved.  

UNICEF Botswana will avoid a “one size fits all” programme approach, meaning that different programmes will find different balances between upstream and downstream work, or focus on just one of the two. UNICEF Botswana will continue to explore a more geographically convergent approach to downstream work in which multiple programmes are using this approach in a single district. This strategy is particularly relevant when child wellbeing indicators can be improved by multiple interventions. 

Second, strengthened risk preparedness is required to address ad-hoc emergencies and recurrent climatic stresses. The diarrhoea outbreak in the third quarter of 2018 required a quick reaction to procure oral rehydration salts (oral rehydration salts) and tube feeding devices on behalf of the Government. UNICEF Botswana ensured quick delivery of supplies, despite limited in-house emergency capacity, and with crucial support from UNICEF headquarters and regional office.  Recurrent drought conditions in the country may harm the well-being of children. Despite low levels of risk, UNICEF recognizes the need to be better prepared to respond to situations. In 2018, UNICEF Botswana strengthened its risk preparedness through the UNICEF Botswana emergency preparedness platform, contracting expertise to support the development of a risk preparedness plan, including terms of reference for the emergency focal person and the emergency management team (standard operating procedures developed this year). 

Third, scarce and uneven funding limits the scope of UNICEF Botswana programming in Botswana. The country office relies on regular resources and thematic funds for most of its programming. In general, very few public funds are available for Botswana, as only PEPFAR provides funding for children’s health and HIV
Fourth, the absence of quality and up-to-date data hinders child poverty analysis. For example, the most recent estimate of under-fivebirth registration is from 2014. Data from the Multi-Topic Household Survey, a key measure of poverty collected by Statistics Botswana in 2015/2016, was only released in December 2018. Malnutrition statistics should have been part of the survey, but they are not yet released and therefore data for stunting date as far back as 2007. The Violence Against Children Survey from 2016 has not yet been released. The delays in launching the Botswana AIDS Impact Survey this year mean an absence of current HIV incidence and prevalence estimates. The updated Multiple Overlapping Deprivation Analysis that was planned for 2018 has been postponed to 2019 in the absence of up-to-date data.

To strengthen data availability, UNICEF Botswana has advocated that Statistics Botswana undertake a Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, which has not been undertaken in Botswana for close to two decades. In addition, since the Botswana Multi-Topic Household Survey did not include child poverty analysis, UNICEF Botswana and Statistics Botswana have agreed to collaborate to analyse the data to create a child poverty statistics brief. UNICEF Botswana will also support the Government to strengthen the technical capacity of Statistics Botswana with key concepts and a practical framework for multi-dimensional child poverty analysis. It is anticipated that these efforts will increase integration of child poverty analyses into the Government’s existing survey and reporting processes. 

Fifth, while non-government organization partnerships furthered UNICEF Botswana’s ability to deliver, new partners need training in partnership engagement and reporting processes. In 2018, UNICEF Botswana increased the number of formal partnerships with non-government organizations from three to six to support community-level implementation. Capacitated and mandate-relevant civil society organizations are sparse and while the selected partners are considered low-risk, UNICEF Botswana recognizes the need to invest time and effort in capacity development of these partners. Given the newness of the partnerships, and despite the low financial disbursements, UNICEF Botswana will carry out more programme and financial assurance activities to ensure proper implementation. 

In addition to the above lessons learned, UNICEF Botswana has analysed how cross-cutting strategies make our work more effective and efficient. Initiatives such as cross-sectoral programming, Public Finance for Children (PF4C) and enhanced partnerships have created opportunities for UNICEF Botswana to be a trusted convener and facilitator of dialogue between development partners, Government, civil society, and businesses. 

In 2016, Botswana country office determined that cross-sectoral programming would be key to combatting sexual abuse/exploitation and enhancing the quality and quantity of early childhood development services. The #esengmongwaneng campaign against sexual abuse and exploitation combined the efforts of UNICEF Botswana experts in communications, HIV, child protection, communication for development and monitoring and evaluation. We collaborated with two ministries, civil society organizations, private sector entities and United Nations agencies. The partnerships will continue to be leveraged in 2019 as the campaign continues. Similarly, the endorsement of the early childhood development policy framework, as well as community-level implementation of early childhood development interventions, includes three key Government ministries’ participation and three non-government organisations. It is implemented by UNICEF Botswana experts in education, child protection, nutrition, communication for development, and monitoring and evaluation. All these stakeholders will be involved in the ‘early moments matter’ campaign in 2019. 

UNICEF Botswana’s PF4C work demonstrated the value of working with several sectors in a handful of ministries and with programme specialists from various disciplines. In 2018, UNICEF Botswana conducted an interactive workshop for ten planning officers from the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development and other line ministries, resulting in enhanced cross-ministerial coordination and partnership. Active involvement of UNICEF Botswana specialists in PF4C advocacy is also crucial at the sectoral level. In 2019, each programme specialist will spearhead sectoral budget discussions and advocacy with the technical support of the social policy specialist. Department heads in ministries will also be engaged to ensure that budget data can be used to make decisions about effective and efficient allocations and expenditures. 

To improve cooperation between senior Government and UNICEF Botswana staff, in December 2018 UNICEF Botswana Deputy Representative and four Permanent Secretaries signed workplans for the following year. The workplans include activities, indicators, and agreed financial contributions from UNICEF and from the Government of Botswana.

Finally, UNICEF Botswana learned that, while the chances of leveraging direct funding to UNICEF from companies is limited, opportunities to influence company policies and leverage technical support from companies for programme delivery can go a long way towards achieving results for children in Botswana. In 2018, the CEO Council for Children’s Rights identified early childhood development and sexual abuse and exploitation as key priorities for the year. Three large companies gave women an extra month of maternity leave, while fathers are entitled to five days paternity leave. UNICEF Botswana encouraged private sector partners to explore how to provide breastfeeding rooms, a crèche service and other childcare options for their employees. Members of the council also carried early childhood development and sexual exploitation and abuse messages in their major activities such as annual cultural festival and wellness days. 

In sum, despite the challenges of uneven funding and inadequate data, UNICEF Botswana has been able to leverage partnerships with non-government organizations, private sector, and more senior levels of government ministries to improve children’s lives. Collaboration across sectors, both within UNICEF Botswana and between ministries, has resulted in more effective campaigns against sexual abuse and more nuanced understanding of budget processes. In 2019, UNICEF Botswana looks forward to building on the lessons learned regarding using both downstream and upstream approaches, capacitating non-government organization partners, and remaining vigilant about potential disasters. Backed by a full staff complement for the first time in four years, UNICEF Botswana stands ready to help improve the lives of all children in Botswana.

Limited disaggregated data and monitoring 
In 2018, UNICEF in collaboration with United Nations agencies continued to support the Government to generate and analyse quality data, such as secondary analysis on Demographic and Health SurveyIII and the Multiple Overlapping Deprivation Analysis (MODA).  

This data is essential to monitor the situation of children and women in Burundi,and key for designing and monitoring programmes and measuring progress and results. As evidenced during the 2018 UNICEF and government monitoring visit to the field, disaggregated data is still missing at the commune level in most sectors. This impedes effective targeting of the most vulnerable populations. Gender-disaggregated data was not consistently available, including in sectors where information management systems are in place, notable in the education sector where it’s challenging to report on key indicators disaggregated by sex.  

In child protection, data availability is the greatest challenge. Challenges in monitoring and documenting cases were noticed where beneficiaries, especially returnees or internally displaced persons, keep a low profile to avoid the attention of government authorities. Budget data on expenditures is also not available. 

To address the gap in data, the United Nations agencies in Burundi mapped vulnerabilities on 50 indicators, including Sustainable Development Goal indicators concerning UNICEF. This will help the United Nations design resilience programming and advocate for better investment in areas of vulnerability. The exercise will also highlight gaps in data. 

UNICEF will continue working with the education and health systems supporting timely and systematic data collection to ensure availability of quality disaggregated data. UNICEF will also enhance its engagement with all United Nations agencies and other partners, importantly with national partners in a leading role, in data collection, dissemination and use; and strengthen humanitarian-performance monitoring as an integral part of data management.

Multi-sector integrated programming 
Both the 2030 Agenda and UNICEF’s Strategic Plan recognize that multi-sectoral approaches to programming are essential for accelerating results for the most vulnerable girls and boys, as well as to achieve resilience at the community level. UNICEF Burundiengaged with national and other partners for the development of the new country programme. Lessons learned from the current programme of cooperation provided evidence to support this approach. For instance, to address chronic malnutrition in Burundi, it is important to partner with agencies and engage on nutrition with health and other nutrition-sensitive sectors. Nutrition results will not be fully achieved if challenges in the WASH sector, especially access to drinking water and hygiene practices, are not addressed. The response to the cholera outbreaks in 2016–2017 demonstrated the effectiveness of using a multi-sectoral approach. UNICEF Burundi’s design and implementation ofthe multi-sectoral nutrition package was adopted nationally, and all nutrition partners in the country are now required to implement the same approach.  

In its technical support role to the Scaling Up Nutrition platform, UNICEF assisted national partners in promoting collaboration across sectors to achieve reduction of stunting. In collaboration with the Ministry of Healthand other partners, a communication strategy for 1,000 golden days focusing on nutrition as well as hygiene and child stimulation is in the plans for 2019. The strategy will contribute to early childhood development by giving children the best start to life. UNICEF Burundi will work on the development of an early childhood development strategy in 2019. This will be done in an intersectoral fashion, involving national stakeholders in the health, nutrition, education, protection and hygiene sectors.  

Burundi adopted the performance-based financing system of subsidizing health centres according to the quantity and quality of care provided. With this approach, the World Bank and the Government intend to maximize the benefits gained by key health actors such as health workers and patients. Discussions between the MoH, the World Bank and UNICEF recommended, as a way forward, the expansion and scaling-up of the package for community performance-based financing, to improve community living conditions. 

UNICEF demonstrated good practice of a multi-sectoral approach in the education/child protection sectors. With schools-as-zones-of-peace interventions, education and child protection actors come together to promote a violence-free environment in schools for girls and boys to learn as well as build bridges between schools and out of school spaces for efficient identification and reintegration of out-of-school children.  

Through WASH-in-school interventions, more adolescent girls have thechance to stay in school and transition to secondary school, due to access to sex-segregated latrines that help prevent sexual violence and provide an environment for menstrual hygiene management. 

Programming for adolescent girls and boys highlighted the importance of a cross-sectoral approach, as provision of life skills education involves the health sector (on HIV prevention in this case), education sector, and communication for development. Based on global and local good practices, UNICEF will need to continue engaging with local authorities and formal and informal community networksto provide participation platforms for adolescent girls and boys. These platforms can serve as referral points for access to services, skills building and community-level support as well. 

In the country programme starting in 2019, by leveraging partnerships and building stronger links between sectors internally and with national partners, UNICEF will continue with multi-sectoral and integrated approaches to programming that put the child at the centre. One of the key lessons learned in this process is to ensure that the results from such successful models at community level are documented and evidence is used for scaling up and ensuring buy-in at national level. The nutrition, education and protection cases highlighted above are good examples of such an approach. 

Leveraging partnership for results 
In 2018, UNICEF demonstrated the value of partnerships for children in Burundi. Due to system fragility and limited external resources, UNICEF, other United Nations agencies and non-government organizations have had to support service delivery interventions to the most vulnerable girls and boys in the context of development and humanitarian interventions.  

Joint advocacy and policy dialogue using existing coordination platforms yielded positive results. For example, girls who were pregnant and young mothers were allowed by the Government to continue their education in schools, while thousands of children acquired birth certification thanks to a joint campaign that waived fees for late registration.  

Funds mobilized from development partners, including flexible thematic funding, allowed UNICEF to strengthen the development humanitarian nexus both in service delivery and advocacy.  

Working with other United Nations agencies yielded results of additional resources mobilized for results for children. Thus, joint efforts with World Food Programme, World Health Organisation and Food and Agriculture Organisation to reduce chronic malnutrition expanded the funding base, allowing the model of good practice to gradually go to scale. Another joint programme on peace-building with United Nations Populations fund and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization also garnered resources to expand the interventions to cover a greater number of vulnerable adolescent girls and boys. 

A mapping of vulnerabilities with the United Nations family received positive feedback from donors and development partners as a potential tool for resilience programming, more effective and efficient investment and greater convergence of development efforts to accelerate achievement of results at scale.  

Partnerships with non-government organizations, both international and national, were essential in developing models of service at community level, including integrated models of programming. For example, partnership with CARITAS was critical to define mechanisms for the registration of child victims of sexual violence who request health professional assistance in projects supported by UNICEF (i.e. on HIV, prevention of mother to child transmission, social protection) in an ethical manner, as well as for providing medical and psychosocial care to victims. During 2018, the mechanism supported by UNICEF and the family and community development centres was found to be helpful as it includes disaggregation by age and sex. The next steps will focus on strengthening the reporting and processing of legal documents. 

Other examples of partnerships with non-government organizations that contributed to the scaling up of results include work with World Relief on the integrated community case management agenda. The Education Watch Initiative, a consortium of five non-government organisations supported by UNICEF, helped monitor in education and protection while the national non-government organisation FENADEB was effective in monitoring of child rights. 

Moving forward, UNICEF will continue to work with national and development partners for scale and expansion of proven models of service.

ESAR,Comoros,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
The political environment and change
Political concerns and reforms pushed by the Government have brought about changes in the national and regional administrative structure, including the announced removal of the Commissioner's portfolios at the island level, and a high turnover of technical staff and authorities in implementing partners’ offices. This eventful year had many repercussions on programme implementation. Each political event kept government implementing partners distracted from projects, leading to tardiness in implementation plans. The reshuffle of the Government also created conflicts between the cabinets and technicians. Newcomers sometimes questioned rules and regulations that more experienced civil servants understand. Many meetings with the ministers were necessary to brief new ministers on UNICEF programming and implementation methodology and tools. 

Often, Government engagement for children was neglected for the benefit of the political agenda. Hence, the nutrition platform, approved by the council of ministers for signature by the president, is yet to come out. Engagements reimburse GAVI funds await remaining refunds, and the purchase of vaccine by the Government for 2019 is not yet secured. 

Communication for development
Communication for development is a critical dimension to accelerate the achievement of programme results. Tradition, religion and culture play a major role across the three islands. However, capacity in communication for development is an issue across partners both at national and local levels. Service provider capacity is also limited, resulting in conflicting or sometimes incorrect information provided to mothers/users, in particular concerning health and nutrition. Capacity gaps are massive across the three islands and will require an institutional approach to capacity building.  

Under the current country programme, one staff covers communication for development and external communication with a reporting line to the UNICEF Representative. Given the demands of external communication, advocacy and visibility, there is limited time to focus on communication for development. Despite investment in communication for development at the country programme inception (capacity-building workshops with counterparts, knowledge, attitude and practice study, a communication strategy), the interventions are most often campaigns and event-based, and they lack long-term community engagement or interpersonal communication approaches. There is a need to mobilize families and influencers to deliver social and behaviour change to support programmes. The UNICEF Comoros country office will hire a communication for development technical assistant and develop a new communication for development strategy using the findings of the knowledge, attitude and practice study. 

Integrated community-based initiatives 
Despite significant results in the field, the integrated community-based initiative using infant and young child feeding as entry point, implemented by UNICEF with World Bank funding, will end in June 2019. UNICEF led advocacy to integrate a community-based nutrition component into a World Bank US$10-15 million project. The Government plans to scale up the model nationwide. It would be critical for UNICEF to maintain technical leadership at the least during the transition process to sustain quality of interventions. Building on achievements in the 69 villages, an early childhood development package could be considered for delivery (taking into account partners’ interventions).

Health
A constraint that the immunization programme faced was the result of late resources made available on 1 May 2018. This was followed by a temporary suspension of disbursements when  the Comorian State delayed reimbursement of GAVI funds. Advocacy by UNICEF and Alliance partners resulted in the release of two out of four tranches of arrears, due and the resumption of disbursements.

In 2018, remarkable progress was made in vaccine management due to investment in modern cold chain equipment and supportive supervision for EPI agents. This effort will continue in 2019 with a focus on setting up standard operating procedures and strengthen management processes within all components of effective vaccine management. 

The process of developing micro-plans at district level to address equity gaps in immunization confirmed the critical need for better social mobilization and community engagement. This will be a focus for the next implementing period. While working to develop a coherent, comprehensive and evidence-based national communication for development strategy, UNICEF will continue to support locally-tailored effective initiatives.

Sanitation
UNICEF increased access to improved sanitation especially for poor households. However, limited partner’s capacity, limited interest from senior Government officials, and unclear roles and responsibilities between national, regional and local authorities are bottlenecks for a national scale up. UNICEF Comoros already met the new sanitation sector authorities and will pursue high advocacy and technical guidance for more engagement and strong oversight of wash programme activities implementation. 

Early childhood development and education
UNICEF areas of intervention in the education sector fall under priorities of the Education Sector Transitional Plan and are a government priority. These include school-level governance to foster learning ina well-performing system that grants equitable access to all children school readiness and access from pre-primary to the end of the primary education cycle.  

Despite this, insufficient public resources are made available for the implementation of the Plan. For instance, the lack of specific funds dedicated to the pre-primary component is a constraint on the implementation of activities. There is no budget allocation for pre-school education, and most donors continue to support only the primary. UNICEF Comoros must plea to donors who support Comoros to mobilize resources for children under five years old, and especially the zero to three years. The country office plans to continue the reflection and begin to develop an intersectoral early childhood development approach, possibly using education as an entry point to advocate for increased public spending on early childhood development. 

Civil registration and vital statistics
Civil registration and vital statistics is an area that deserves more in-depth reflection. The country plans to undertake civil registration and vital statistics to propose appropriate and innovative approaches to scale up civil registration service provision, as well as strengthen availability of real time administrative data on vital events. 

Difficulties were encountered in implementing awareness-raising activities to identify foster families who could take care of children in danger. The reception of child victims is done according to certain family traditions and by professionals in charge of protection. This informal system reached its limits and the country needs a legal system for children in conflict with the law and children who are victims of violence. The reception of these children requires a legal framework and substantial financial resources. UNICEF will include this issue on the agenda of upcoming discussions of decision-making bodies such as the forum of technical and financial partners and meetings with the national party.

Social protection and public finance for children 
In 2019, Comoros country office will support the mid-term review of the national social protection policy to integrate the vision of new authorities and identify a new type of cash transfer intervention to which the Government will be more supportive. Despite having generated evidence on the management of budget allocations and expenditures, particularly on priority sectors of health and education, UNICEF Comoros is not yet considered a key partner in the discussion and decision-making on public finance management for children. Economic and financial experts from UNICEF Regional Office supported the country office to leverage support and collaboration with the Ministry of Finance. The lesson learnt is that the right profiles are required with sector government partners for advocacy to succeed.

Data availability 
Comoros faces a lack of quality routine data. The most recent EDS/MICS was conducted in 2012. In 2017, a population census was carried out but the results are not yet available. The availability of quality sectoral data is weak; the 2017/2018 education dashboards are not yet finalized; the national health accounts launched in 2016 are not yet published; and routine data of programmes show discrepancies. The Ministry of Health manages all HMIS data manually in Excel spreadsheets, which significantly constrains the use of any data collected for planning and monitoring purposes.  

In 2019, UNICEF will continue to strengthen data systems, including monitoring using sex-disaggregated indicators. Advocacy and resource mobilization will be conducted for the organization of a MICS in 2019/2020. Given the context, the use of new technologies especially for WASH, nutrition and protection is inevitable and would benefit systems. While there is initial interest in digitizing data, the overall assessment of the enabling environment for digital highlighted foundational gaps that should be addressed first. 

Programmatic and operations
UNICEF plans to recruit a 10-month monitoring and evaluation specialist to focus on sector information-system strengthening and evaluation. The UNICEF programme, monitoring and evaluation combines the functions of social policy and PME specialist. As per the new guidance, Comoros country office is committed to conduct at least one evaluation per year funded preferably with regular resources. The country office will also support capacity development into the new national evaluation office.  

In 2018, UNICEF Comoros implemented several strategies to deliver on programme results, including service delivery with 32 per cent of annual budget expenditures; institutional strengthening of national system (26 per cent); and shaping markets (4 per cent) applied on the sanitation marketing project in rural areas. Evaluation, fostering innovation and use of new technology as well as South–South and horizontal cooperation were funded with less than 0.5 per cent of total expenditures. UNICEF Comoros should examine the funds ear-marked for operating costs of non-staff that gained almost 12 per cent of 2018 expenditures.

In 2018, the regional staff counsellor provided on-site psycho-social support to Comoros country office staff and management to boost moral on issues such as office dynamics, personal issuesand work-life balance. The counsellor also provided technical support to the selection and recruitment of the national psychologist for Comoros Ministry of Health Directorate to Fight Aids. In 2019, UNICEF Comoros will continue with staff well-being as part of its annual work plan implementation. 

In 2019, UNICEF Comoros will continue to strive to mobilize resources, with UNICEF Regional Office support, particularly where implementation was hampered in 2018 by lack of funding.

ESAR,Eritrea,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
A very successful measles-rubella campaign was conducted nationally in November. Its success was attributed to effective partnerships and well-coordinated preparations by the MoH, UNICEF and WHO. This good practice, which included effective micro-planning at the zoba level, enabled the campaign to reach the most remote areas of the country. A preliminary report on campaign coverage indicated a success rate of over 98 per cent.

To support its plan for an open defecation free Eritrea by 2022, a detailed roadmap was developed by the Government and other key stakeholders, with technical and financial support from UNICEF. As part of the exercise the design of latrines was reviewed, and it became clear that communities preferred a certain type of structure that was different from the proposed design. The ODF roadmap takes this into consideration and prioritizes latrines that will actually be used, without compromising their quality.

During 2018 UNICEF supported the MoH with the distribution of nutrition supplies from national level stores to all the integrated management of acute malnutrition health facilities in the country. This helped to mitigate the risk of high defaulter rates and played a vital role in maintaining positive treatment outcomes. UNICEF exercised flexibility by supporting a function that is usually played by the Government, as per existing procurement guidelines.

In the area of generating and promoting the use of evidence, lack of reliable data remained the major challenge in 2018. The plan to conduct the Eritrean Population and Health Survey, originally scheduled for 2015, was postponed again, to early 2019. However, the first-ever evaluation of the Strategic Partnership Cooperation Framework (SPCF) between the Government and the UN was successfully concluded in 2018, with technical and financial support from UNICEF. The final report received an overall rating of ‘satisfactory’, based on the UN Evaluation Group Standard. While Eritrea’s national capacity for and interest in evaluation is still limited, experience with this evaluation is expected to stimulate a culture of evaluation and serve as a stepping stone toward increased evidence-generation and use of data.

The peace process between Eritrea and other countries in the Horn of Africa is extremely positive, but the situation has caused delays, as the Government is now reprioritizing and developing new strategies in light of the current situation. This led to a freeze on most interventions, requiring some changes in UNICEF’s workplans and the development of alternative working modalities in collaboration with partners. All life-saving interventions,such as nutrition, IMNCI, the measles-rubella campaign and WASH, were carried out as a result of continuous UNICEF advocacy and collaboration with the Government as were child protection activities, the monitoring learning achievement survey and sports for participation.

UNICEF Eritrea improved its internal governance, as well as the efficiency and effectiveness of programme implementation by addressing recommendations from the May 2018 audit. Key improvements included an in-depth review and revision of risk assessment, finalization of a resource mobilization strategy, development of an office advocacy plan and introduction of the recommendation/action tracking system for quality assurance activities related to DCTs. In 2019 UNICEF Eritrea will continue to implement and further improve these new initiatives for better internal governance and programme implementation.

To overcome challenges faced in 2018 in the education sector, UNICEF aims to increase cross-sectoral collaboration and continue to build on the successes achieved. UNICEF is cognizant of weaknesses in terms of integrated ECD, but in 2018 analysed the practical entry points for service delivery. In 2019, the focus will be on developing these in an integrated manner to further ensure full development of young children.

Standardization of community health systems will be supported in 2019 as a strategy for achieving equity and universal health coverage. This will involve further strengthening of integrated outreach services in hard-to-reach areas and rolling out of decentralized district health systems. During 2019 there will be renewed focus on newborn care in facilities and communities and greater focus on programme convergence at the community level for optimal results in child survival and development. To address the non-availability of services in hard-to-reach areas, UNICEF will support the MoH to revitalize the Eritrea Barefoot Doctor programme as a stop-gap measure over the next few years while the Government constructs, equips and provides human resources for new health facilities in under-served areas.

"
ESAR,Eswatini,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
In 2018 UNICEF Eswatini faced challenges and learned lessons that offer opportunities from which to shape programme implementation over the next two years.

The reporting year was characterized by local and national elections, which led to a change of leadership at community, constituency and national levels. The campaigns and changes in leadership delayed the pace of programme implementation, especially for community-based interventions for which community leadership was critical to mobilize and engage rights- holders. 

Sustaining UNICEF-supported programmes in a context of limited government resources and human resource capacities presents a challenge. UNICEF prioritized evidence-generation on child poverty, inequity and budget transparency through its policy advocacy; informed investment cases and strategic interventions; and worked with the MoF and line ministries to obtain the best possible outcome for children and adolescents from domestic spending. However, a key challenge was the limited quantity of domestic resources available in 2018. Despite significant gains in supporting the development of strategic, evidence-based programmes to accelerate results for children and adolescents, the Government’s inability to finance its commitments adversely affects UNICEF’s high-level policy advocacy and has longer-term negative effects on the country. Cognizant of this, UNICEF played a key role in establishing a multi-sectoral group of principal secretaries from 12 line ministries responsible for issues affecting children and adolescents, to elevate these issues on the national development agenda and increase government accountability for achievement of results.

Although Eswatini has developed numerous policies prioritizing social and child-related outcomes, they are often not effectively and transparently incorporated into budgets and programmes, contributing to slow and inefficient implementation. Core issues of sufficiency, efficiency, effectiveness and equity in sector programme budgets constrain key results for children and adolescents. Across various sectors, stronger financial and programme accountability is needed to obtain the best possible results from government resources. Efforts are required to ensure that resources are allocated to low-cost, high-impact interventions and that results-based budgeting and value for money approaches are adopted to achieve more effective spending for children and adolescents. Improving resource distribution to promote equitable spending, with greater attention to disadvantaged groups and areas, is a priority for UNICEF. A key lesson learned was the importance of working with both the MoF and line ministries to ensure that equitable financial allocations are made, through targeted programme and budget approaches. Targeting programmes would make a significant contribution to the national goal of reducing extreme poverty. 

While Eswatini has received significant technical assistance; developed key policy documents, strategies and plans; and received staff capacity, all aimed at improving the situation of children and adolescents, a persistent implementation gap impedes improved outcomes. Closing the implementation gap will continue to remain a high priority for UNICEF in the country, in particular investing in interventions that improve the situation for children, adolescents and other most vulnerable population groups. 

A key challenge to effective monitoring and reporting on results for children and adolescents has been the ‘verticalization’ of results; that is, monitoring only by individual sectors, with no linkages between them. No government body holistically monitors and tracks performance on indicators reflecting child and adolescent well-being. This calls for a shift from sector monitoring to government-wide monitoring that engages all key line ministries. As a result of UNICEF Eswatini’s high-level advocacy, a multi-sectoral group of principal secretaries from 12 key line ministries responsible for child and adolescent issues was established in 2018, presenting an opportunity to put these issues at the top of the national agenda and support the effective monitoring of results achieved for children and adolescents by Government and partners. 

Gains in 2018 also illustrated that work on real-time data and innovation is critical and should be strengthened to enable expansion. The RapidPro platform enabled UNICEF programmes to leverage information and communication technologies for the delivery of national services and monitoring of programmes, while strengthening the ability of citizens to give feedback on service quality. UNICEF Eswatini was able to demonstrate the unique value-added of this innovation through technical support and leadership for RapidPro and U-Report. However, UNICEF has not yet fully embraced RapidPro and its innovation platform potential within programming, due to human resource issues. This will require ensuring sufficient support to meet the demand created, as well as to support scale-up and sustainability within government programmes. A key lesson learned on what worked in this pilot initiative was that anchoring it within existing programmes (such as the CMIS) enhances scalability and sustainability.

In addition, work in 2018 demonstrated that Government investment in the design, implementation, monitoring and assessment of programmes is important to ensuring their integration in national programmes, priorities and systems, helping to ensure sustainable ownership. This, in turn, translates into embedding initiatives and programmes into national policies, development plans and budgets, and ensuring that sufficient technical capacity exists within the country to manage all facets of the programme.

The use of social and behaviour change communication approaches appears to be having an impact on both HIV knowledge and related behaviours, such as condom use and HIV testing. For example, combined peer-to-peer communication on HIV prevention at school clubs and risk-perception sessions targeting adolescent girls led to increased demand for and uptake of HIV testing services. It also became clear that strengthening communication must be based on available facilities that can enhance access to services. For example, a toll-free helpline renovated and equipped with UNICEF financial and technical support, to enhance reporting of cases of violence against children in school, remained underutilized, possibly due to inadequate awareness of its existence and functioning.

Gender-responsive programming is instrumental in contributing to the results of the country programme. For example, peer-facilitated adolescent girls-only school-based clubs for HIV prevention provided a forum where girls discuss their specific challenges and needs, without interference and disruption by male counterparts. In addition, a programme intervention focusing on addressing masculinity as it relates to elevated levels of sexual violence, gender-based violence and HIV in Eswatini – through a curriculum for boys and out-of-school young men – helped to shape new gender norms, improve male attitudes toward sex and sexuality and increase update of condom use, medical male circumcision and HIV testing among the 430 participating boys and young men. 

Another key lesson learned was the importance of strengthening the humanitarian/ development nexus with in the country programme. Given recurring climate-induced emergencies, it is apparent that key strategies such as: resilience building, strengthening local and national systems, promoting risk-informed programming through multi-hazard risk analysis, systematically creating space for affected people to voice their distinct needs and using feedback to inform design and provision of services and take corrective measures, strengthening social protection systems to scale-up cash transfers in emergencies, ensuring that minimum preparedness standards are in place and leveraging of inter-agency system- wide strategies will require greater focus to mitigate the impact of humanitarian emergencies in the coming years.

Cross-cutting strategies

Cross-cutting strategies were utilized by UNICEF Eswatini to achieve results for children. Achieving results at scale is at the core of Eswatini’s programming, bringing together efforts for better integration of programmes, increased cooperation and strong partnerships, capacity building at all levels (policy, management, service delivery) and improved service quality and demand creation at the community level. Combined, these elements determine the success of programmes and their potential for scale-up. As systems and services are being built and strengthened simultaneously in Eswatini, programme scale-up is considered throughout the design, delivery and monitoring and evaluation of UNICEF programmes.

Achieving realization of the rights of all children in Eswatini lies at the core of UNICEF’s work. UNICEF Eswatini promotes the rights of children, adolescents and women by harnessing expertise, good practices, results-based management, knowledge and experience to influence decision-makers and stakeholders through public and ‘silent’ advocacy. Closely linked to advocacy and partnerships is the use of evidence to drive change. In 2018, UNICEF generated and triangulated new data on the status of children, adolescents and women. The combination of evidence, good practices and innovation to identify and solutions and approaches all contribute towards quality programming. 

To support programme success and scale-up, advocacy, partnerships and participation serve to galvanize support for the cause of children and to mobilize people, resources and commitment to achieving results for children. UNICEF Eswatini continued strengthening its engagement with existing partners and explored opportunities to engage with the private sector to achieve results for children and adolescents. UNICEF’s strategic engagement and advocacy with the small (but influential) private sector resulted in the establishment of a private sector platform to support advocacy and results for children and adolescents through complementary funding. Concept notes on pre-primary education and newborn care were developed to guide private sector commitments through pledges for support (financial, technical and in-kind) by businesses and local municipalities.

For optimal leveraging of results across sectors, the programme focused on an integrated programming approach and developed an investment case for adolescents focusing on HIV prevention, secondary school education and violence prevention and response. The key goal was to promote secondary school completion and skills acquisition for employability. This will also be the platform for resource mobilization and leveraging for adolescents and young people, feeding into the Generation Unlimited agenda.

Looking forward
Drawing on lessons learned and emerging opportunities, UNICEF Eswatini will look forward by focusing on five critical and interconnected strategies that will drive implementation of the country programme for the next two years and improve results for children: (1) improving the quality of national systems and services through institutional systems strengthening; (2) expanding and strengthening public and private partnerships; (3) working with Government and partners on scale and sustainability of programmes; (4) linking evidence and advocacy; (5) broadening participation, with a focus on human rights-based approaches. 

Partnerships will continue to drive UNICEF Eswatini’s programming. Strong partnerships with national and local government will ensure alignment with government priorities and contribute to sustained results for children. UNICEF will also continue its strategic engagement with other key institutions and donors to explore possible areas of collaboration, to build on the various initiatives being supported by UNICEF in the country. 

UNICEF Eswatini and the Government will also collaborate closely to improved integrated programming and collaboration across sectoral areas, such as child health, birth registration, adolescents and social protection. Special attention will be paid to strengthening coordination around civil registration and vital statistics, integrated ECD, adolescents and youth and social protection. Due to its focus on interventions that improve the situation for children, adolescents and the most vulnerable populations, during the next two years UNICEF Eswatini will drill down on the implementation of programmes to address extreme poverty.  

Other key focus areas will be closing the implementation gap and processes to achieve more effective and accountable spending. Partnerships will continue to be nurtured and expanded. The private sector will be engaged as a vital partner supporting interventions linked to issues facing adolescents and youth. Partnerships with the media (television, radio and print) will continue to be developed, seeking new and innovative ways to advocate for and engage the public in children’s issues. 

Sustainability and scale-up of programmes and service for children and families will be essential as the current programme nears completion. Generating compelling evidence on what works and what does not will guide programme adaptation and implementation, to ensure that what is taken to scale is appropriate and sustainable. The costing of programmes– in particular the newly developed child health programme and national health accounts– will provide information to Government and partners regarding the investments required to scale-up and sustain results for children. Advocacy for increased financial commitments from the Government will be needed to create the fiscal space for improving access to and quality of services, especially for vulnerable groups and those living in rural and remote communities. UNICEF Eswatini will continue to expand its public finance for children interventions and work with Government to support more transparent, equitable and effective spending for children and improved coordination with implementing line ministries, to ensure that child and equity-related priorities are incorporated in budget planning.

Given that Eswatini has the highest HIV prevalence globally and limited programmes for adolescents and young people, UNICEF Eswatini will increase its support for the development of national strategies and programmes for adolescents and young people. Generation Unlimited is an emerging investment priority for the creation of scalable, innovative, integrated and costed solutions for multiple-service delivery platforms for adolescents and young people. The focus on these areas presents an opportunity to strengthen integrated and multi-sectoral approaches to programming.

As access to services continues to increase through Government and partner investments, the equity and quality of these services and the results achieved will be prioritized. UNICEF will continue to focus many of its interventions on the hardest-to-reach populations and expand its programming for vulnerable groups, such as extremely poor children with multiple deprivations, children with disabilities and children affected by violence, abuse and neglect. Services will be improved through capacity building and systems strengthening, taking into account lessons learned and the local context. Continual quality improvement approaches will focus on improving the performance of health services at facilities, integrating the RapidPro platform with the existing CMIS. 

UNICEF Eswatini will work with Government and partners to holistically monitor progress toward child indicators, measuring achievement of results to better identify subject areas and populations requiring additional support. Across programmes, improved programme monitoring and information-sharing will allow for regular review and adjustment of interventions, to ensure that service quality improvement efforts are successful and replicable.

"
ESAR,Ethiopia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Conflict- and drought-induced displacements overstretched the humanitarian response capacity in Ethiopia, further limiting the capacity of implementing partners and affecting the service delivery of UNICEF Ethiopia’s regular programming. Thus, UNICEF Ethiopia worked closely with the Government to develop resilient, risk-informed approaches to improve their preparedness to respond at scale and with quality. The need for cross-sectoral integration was repeatedly highlighted due to structural weaknesses exposed in established systems in various sectors. This required high-level advocacy, adapted service models for remote populations, integrated commodity supply chains, flexible staff deployment and surge budgets, and emergency preparedness planning. In particular, UNICEF highlighted the impact of humanitarian crises on children, with key messages disseminated through social and mainstream media and donor visits, resulting in needed funding for humanitarian response. 

Goal area 1: Every child survives and thrives 

Political instability and civil unrest negatively impacted on routine health system implementation by hindering access to the programme sites, limiting health workers’ capacity to provide services, and hampering ability of affected populations to seek and access healthcare services. Poor infrastructure in the country also creates obstacles to access the most underserved areas. Better coordination with partners at national and sub-national levels should be a focus to improve programme implementation and outcomes for vulnerable populations. In addition, joint advocacy from UNICEF Ethiopia programme sections should be carried out to highlight the weaknesses identified within the health system during emergency response, including issues of staff vacancies and commodity stock-outs. 

Human resource consistency and capacity remained a major bottleneck for health services. Low salaries and poor working conditions led to high staff turnover. In 2018, UNICEF funded seven emergency technical assistants to supplement service gaps and build capacity of existing health staff. This situation is unsustainable and needs further reflection with the Government to improve efficiency and effectiveness.

The health service delivery model in Ethiopia, particularly for immunization and micronutrient supplementation, are moving from one-off campaigns to long-term routine delivery to achieve scale and sustainability. Given the complex humanitarian environment, both campaigns (rapid results in emergency situations) and routine delivery are needed, and neither should divert attention and resources from the other. More efforts are needed to achieve integrated programming and ensure sustainable service delivery for child health. Public health gains, particularly for maternal child health, nutrition and baby WASH, require cross-sectoral collaboration for integration into ongoing sector initiatives. For example, increasing dietary diversity among children and women who are pregnant requires UNICEF to also support food and nutrition security through promoting nutrition-sensitive value chains for agricultural products, thus reducing the overall burden of acute malnutrition in line with the SDG Zero Poverty and Hunger strategy.

Ensuring service quality remained a challenge and requires continual system monitoring, adherence to best practices, and further investment. As the expansion of the Health Extension Programme moves forward, there remains a need for ongoing advocacy, policy dialogue and technical assistance between the Government and its partners for developing acceptable quality services for all sectors. Challenges remain in community engagement, including the development of accountability and supervision systems for HEWs. The women’s development armies are overburdened by unclear multi-sectoral mandates, which also hinders community engagement. UNICEF plans to review community engagement through the optimization of the Health Extension Programme in 2019. Some gender-related challenges need to be highlighted, specifically the heavy work burden, inadequate incentive structures and poor work environment of the predominantly female workforce. 

Goal area 2: Every child learns 

The ethnic conflicts in Somali, Oromia, Amhara, Gambella and Benishangul Gumuz regions in 2018 hampered implementation of the learning and development programme. The educational needs of displaced children and young people resulted in a shifting of human resources to the humanitarian response. The complexity of the IDP context also translated into challenges in designing medium- and longer-term education interventions in conflict-affected regions. 

There were delays in the timely recruitment of regional cluster coordinators due to the limited availability of professionals with expertise in this area. This challenge was partly overcome by seeking NGO partners operating in these regions to re-deploy their staff to serve in the regional education cluster coordinator capacity, with financing from UNICEF Ethiopia. In 2019, the Learning and Development programme will formalize standing arrangements with key NGOs in the education emergency cluster for rapid deployment of sub-national cluster coordinators.

The national Gender Parity Index for primary education did not meet the ESDP V target for 2016/17, dropping to 0.90 from 0.91 in the prior year, despite investments through GEQIP to improve girls’ participation in general education. Underpinning the limited enrolment of girls are the persistent social and gender norms which place low value on girls’ education, leading to delayed enrolment and high drop-out rates. 

The research on the effectiveness of the School-Related Gender-Based Violence Code of Conduct noted positive results, though several areas require further attention in 2019. The research indicated that violence experienced by students was not reported through the system, and few reports reached the gender-based violence school committees for investigation. Students were reluctant to report violence due to the perceived lack of support and case confidentiality. It also showed views amongst staff on the scope of the Code of Conduct varied, with certain staff possessing a narrow interpretation of violence (excluding corporal punishment and bullying, and violence against boys). A management response plan to the research findings will be implemented in UNICEF’s focus woredas in 2019, as addressing violence within school environments remains a critical pre-condition to children - particularly girls - completing primary education and transitioning to secondary education. UNICEF Ethiopia will also aim to link the relevant reporting and referral mechanisms for gender-based violence of MoE and MoWCY in 2019 to ensure appropriate facilities and quality services are in place.

The infrequent learning assessments implemented in Ethiopia, particularly in lower primary education, has made it challenging to ascertain direct correlation between UNICEF’s investments and improved learning outcomes of children. In late 2018, UNICEF Ethiopia initiated a partnership with the National Examination and Assessment Authority and ARRA, seeking to develop and implement a Holistic Early Grades Learning Assessment in 2019 across refugee hosting regions, including a measurement of students’ ‘transferable’ skills, such as academic persistence and problem solving.

The MoE has increased expectations for UNICEF engagement within pre-primary education in 2019, which will translate into support for the development of a costed expansion plan for the pre-primary education sub-sector. 

UNICEF Ethiopia has drawn on these lessons to inform its results and staffing structures to ensure adequate technical expertise is made available, particularly in the field offices. 

Goal 3: Every child is protected from violence and exploitation 

The key challenges in 2018 were the gaps in humanitarian funds for child protection in emergency and the limited capacity of federal and regional partners, particularly in child protection and gender-based violence response in humanitarian settings. To address this, specifically for the IDP response, UNICEF staff were deployed to the affected regions. They worked directly with government officials to support family tracing and reunification, as well as documentation needed to help ensure minimum quality standards were in place and children were being protected from violence and exploitation. Partnership agreements with local and international NGOs were implemented to help address capacity limitations of government partners. UNICEF also sought to strengthen the engagement and leadership of the MoWCY in the Child Protection Gender-Based Violence Sub-Cluster. 

Another challenge was the absence of mechanisms for collecting comprehensive and disaggregated data on children being referred to and receiving protection services. As a key lesson learned, UNICEF Ethiopia is commissioning a capacity assessment of the child protection system to align with latest global developments and to help ensure the efficacy of its technical and financial investments in the immediate and longer-term. As the country prepares to embark on roll-out of a national case management framework for child protection, including refugee and IDP children, and children on the move, it is evident that there are gaps in mandates and roles of key actors, for which the system needs to set accountabilities to ensure children are protected from harm. It is anticipated that this assessment will provide government partners and UNICEF Ethiopia with evidence and recommendations to inform policy and programmatic decisions and investments. 

Despite UNICEF advocacy, justice for children work is still done through a project office, impeding sustainability. Efforts being led by UNDP to review the overall justice sector, including justice for children, are expected to help inform strategic directions of the Government and UN agencies in 2019. 

Change in the MoWCY leadership in 2018 resulted in modification to the strategic approaches, which required more investments in advocacy for key protection issues. Notably affected was the finalization of the national costed roadmap to end child marriage and female genital mutilation/cutting. UNICEF secured additional human and financial resources to support the adjustments, and allocated staff time for advocacy to help ensure the robustness of the costed roadmap. 

Despite advocacy and technical support provided by UNICEF Ethiopia, the African Centre for Statistics and other development partners, the lack of a comprehensive assessment and strategic plan aligned with the lessons learned and guidelines from the Africa Programme for Accelerated Improvement of Civil Registration and Vital Statistics impeded systematic planning and investments. For example, the requirement of payment for certificates in some regions and the mandatory presence of both parents for birth registration discouraged families from registering their children and served as a gendered barrier to birth registration. Moreover, registration among pastoralist communities was also impeded. These issues will remain advocacy priorities in 2019. 

Goal 4: Every child lives in a safe and clean environment 

The first round of the WASH sustainability checks highlighted the need to concentrate on quality and continued follow-up, which will be a key focus for UNICEF Ethiopia in 2019. The security situation in several regions constrained implementation, particularly in Oromia and Somali regions. As such, these two regions were excluded from the sustainability checks.

Support from the UNICEF Kenya and UNICEF ESARO was instrumental in pushing forward the sanitation agenda, particularly through the global Lixil agreement. Due to the challenging business environment in Ethiopia, Lixil initially experienced difficulties in setting up manufacturing in the country. A key lesson learnt was the need to involve the Ministry of Industry and Finance at the onset of discussions for the establishment of the manufacturing hub. With robust marketing, the SaTo pan has the potential to be a game-changer in the uptake of improved sanitation. With due to the rising costs of constructing concrete slabs in Ethiopia, there is an opportunity to present the SaTo pan as a cost-effective alternative. 

The menstrual health and hygiene and baby WASH programmes both moved forward in 2018 and will require close cross-sectoral collaboration to integrate with ongoing health, nutrition, and education initiatives. The supply chain review for the menstrual health and hygiene programme showed the need to shift from localized production to supporting national supply chain networks for effective regional scale-up.

The role of the private sector has been enhanced through the ‘Build-Capacity Build-Transfer’ (BCBT) contracting modality to improve efficiency in service delivery. The capacity building component of the BCBT pilot triggered sector reforms: specifically, the Public Rural Utility model was identified as a promising model to manage multi-village water supply schemes implemented by the Government and UNICEF.

Key lessons learned in 2018 were regarding the integrated approach for service delivery in small and medium towns and the potential for urban-rural integration. Integrated solutions, such as focusing on a comprehensive package of interventions and linking WASH service delivery and behaviour change communication led to better living conditions and health improvements in urban towns and the adjacent satellite villages. In addition, development of business models for water and sanitation servicesfor Utilities and public private operators, such as business plans for solid and liquid waste management and public latrines,led to improved planning and greater long-term sustainability of facilities. As Cluster lead, UNICEF Ethiopia enhanced the humanitarian-development nexus by showcasing climate-resilient WASH interventions, which are now included in phase II of the OneWASH National Programme. UNICEF also maintained strong linkages with technical experts from Brazil through South-South cooperation, leading to the completion of condominium sewage treatment facility under the Urban WASH programme.

UNICEF will draw on these lessons and constraints to inform its programming in 2019. 

Goal 5: Every child has an equitable chance in life 

In social protection, findings from an operation research in 2017 on the cash-plus pilots commissioned by UNICEF Ethiopia provided evidence on the need for a systems approach with a combination of cash transfers and service provision to improve multiple outcomes with respect to nutrition, health, education and child protection. Despite strengthening the systems approach, given the frequent rotation of local service providers and community health workers, there is a need to continuously build capacity of frontline workers at woreda and kebele levels. Capacity building efforts included institutional development of the social welfare workforce and rollout of self-learning tools on nutrition, gender and social development. This will ensure adequate coordination mechanisms and proper implementation of the PNSP and cash-plus pilots. Moreover, timely transition of pregnant beneficiaries from public works to the temporary direct support scheme remained a challenge. For this, coordination between health extension workers, the agricultural extension workers and social workers needs reinforcement and continuous support to ensure pregnant women receive adequate support. 

A key lesson learned in 2018 through the partnership with the Ministry of Finance was that results for children can be significantly improved through politically-aware engagements with sector ministries. The timely engagement by UNICEF Ethiopia with line ministries on the annual budget preparations, in a changing political context, can ensure their budget calls reflect understanding about children and the financing needs for child-focused and prioritized programmes. In addition, the importance of a macro view of current and past investments in the social sectors was highlighted, with children’s issues able to guide and inform policy discussions. It became evident that a deeper understanding of the contribution of federal and regional government budgets is important to have a complete picture of public investments for children in Ethiopia. In terms of child and adolescent participation, there is a need for streamlined, integrated and engaging approaches for enhancing child participation given the improving political space in the country and the potential of this work to build active citizenship in all spheres of life. 

In terms of evidence generation and use, UNICEF promoted strong partnerships with national research institutions to conduct research and studies on child-rights and poverty, including CSA, National Planning Commission, Ethiopian Development Research Institute, MoWCY, and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. These partnerships resulted in strong ownership of research findings and reinforced national capacities. UNICEF also developed partnerships with international research institutions to support training and capacity building of national researchers. The partnership between the Economic Policy Research Institute, CSA and UNICEF consolidated national capacity to understand multidimensional child poverty in Ethiopia, its drivers, and the ways to address the issue. In 2019, UNICEF Ethiopia will prioritize support to the Ministry of Finance on the research roadmap of fiscal policy reforms.

The lessons learned and solutions to challenges described above will contribute to defining the shifts in the 2019 work plans and the strategic directions for the new country programme. 




"
ESAR,Kenya,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Decentralization
A major lesson learned was the importance of strengthening capacity of county governments, which in a devolved context, is where UNICEF can make the biggest difference given its comparative advantage. With devolution ongoing since 2011, county governments have become highly strategic entities, controlling more than 4.5 per cent of GDP and responsible for planning and delivering all devolved functions, including health, nutrition, water, sanitation, urban services, ECD and local infrastructure. Counties are obliged to develop integrated plans, designate planning units at all county administrative levels and promote public participation and engagement by non-state actors in the planning process. However, the devolved system is still relatively new, and the need for capacity strengthening continues.

In this context, UNICEF’s support to develop 21 County Integrated Development Plans has contributed to strengthening planning and budgeting for areas such as nutrition, child protection, emergency response and health, which were not adequately covered in previous plans. In 2018, several counties (including Vihiga, Kakamega, Kisumu, Mombasa, Turkana, Kitui and Siaya) have initiated legislative or policy frameworks to address key bottlenecks to accessing and utilizing health, water, nutrition, child protection and other services. UNICEF is continuing to strengthen engagement with the devolved system of governance, across the wide scope of areas of development and humanitarian support. 

Climate
Kenya is highly exposed to climate-related hazards such as cyclical droughts and floods, resulting in increased risks of disease outbreaks, conflicts and food and nutrition insecurity. Severe drought in 2017 and floods in 2018 showed the need to be continuously prepared for climate-based disasters/emergencies when working to build capacity at county and national levels. 

Although predicting climate risks presents a challenge, understanding existing risks and their locations supports risk-informed programming. UNICEF initiated climate-emergency risk assessments related to WASH, health and education programmes with the national Government and five county governments, and will continue to strengthen government capacity to link development and humanitarian response interventions. 

UNICEF Kenya continued to invest in increasing the resilience of marginalized and vulnerable communities to climate risks and cyclical shocks across its programmes. At the same time, it is also essential to prioritize preparedness to respond to climate-related shocks as they occur.


Social protection
Significant interest in expanding social protection and leveraging existing governmental and other resources exists in Kenya. During 2018 social protection schemes expanded from 850,000 to 1.3 million beneficiaries, covering around 3 million children. The sector’s budget allocation increased from close to US$240 million in 2017/18 to almost 30 million in 2018/19. UNICEF Kenya played a strategic advisory role in this expansion. In partnership with the WFP and other donors, UNICEF supported the 2017 sector review and Investment plan, which contributed to convincing the Government to launch the new programme for senior citizens. By May 2018 this programme some 520,000 beneficiaries were receiving government payments. In 2018 UNICEF played a lead advisory role in advocacy for higher and more sustained social protection financing through the second national conference led by the deputy president, where strong commitments were made towards sustainable, inclusive social protection schemes as well as proposed innovative financing for the sector. A call for action was developed to advance implementation of the conference’s recommendations.

UNICEF also used the devolution platform to engage with several counties on social protection schemes, supporting policy and legal frameworks in four counties (Kitui, Mombasa, Vihiga and Kakamega). Although social protection is not a function devolved to counties, Kakamega and Vihiga counties have started implementing a cash transfer model to improve maternal and child health and Kitui County is implementing a universal health insurance model, for which they are providing annual allocations of just under $US$1million and US$300,000, respectively.

Partnership with the WorldBank on the Kenya social and economic inclusion programme contributed to position the cash+nutrition initiative. Through the inclusion programme, UNICEF leveraged US$30 million to scale-up the NICHE in four additional counties, of which US$13 million will be allocated to UNICEF, which was designated by both the World Bank and the Government to provide technical assistance to support the scaling-up. 

Young people
UNICEF’s work with young people is set to expand significantly in Kenya, due both to shifts in national policy (the national commitment to manufacturing will require young people to have the skills required for key industries), and UNICEF’s global corporate commitment to adolescents and young people through the generation unlimited initiative. Working and programming with young people requires developing a comprehensive strategy and implementation on a larger scale, even as we see early results in education, peer support and life skills. 

UNICEF will expand efforts to address second-decade challenges in relation to issues of education and skills development for employability through continued cross-sectoral engagement in adolescent programming. It will take advantage of the political mileage received from the Government’s prioritization and generation unlimited, in terms of advocacy, capacity building and knowledge sharing.

Based on evidence from the situation analysis on adolescent and youth employability, UNICEF will take forward the generation unlimited agenda by facilitating programming around skills development for employability, an issue affecting some 10 million 15–24-year-olds (20 per cent of Kenya’s population). Findings from the study will further inform policy development on adolescent and youth employability in the country.

UNICEF also needs to build its capacity to engage young people on the continuing spread of HIV among adolescents and youth, peer support, life skills and sexuality. Young people need to be at the forefront of conversations around HIV, as many feel that they do not receive adequate engagement or commitment from parents and elders to confront issues that the latter prefer not to discuss.  

United Nations volunteers and youth advocates constitute another facet of UNICEF Kenya’s involvement in skills and employment programming. Youth advocates and volunteers should also focus on passing on skills gained through the platform to peers.

Social media engagement on Twitter and FaceBook are critical for engaging young people. There is a need to scale-up and intensify social media use and effective campaigning, including the use/engagement of influencers, through social media work. Youth advocates should be given comprehensive training on messaging tools and techniques, but can also serve as mentors to future advocates participating in the platform.


Urban areas
There is a great need for programming that addresses urbanization and the inequities faced by those living in informal settlements. This, in turn, requires situational analysis of the context in Kenya’s urban areas to inform programming decisions and strategy. The focus should be on Nairobi but also separate strategies are also needed for smaller cities and towns.

UNICEF Kenya has been identifying challenges associated with vulnerable children in urban settlements. Use of unregulated and unregistered services in the informal sector makes programming difficult. In addition, lack of policy and a regulatory framework to guide service provision puts vulnerable children at risk. There is a need in these areas to address informal structures by advocating for access to and supporting demand creation for formal services. Strengthening regulation, setting quality standards and providing quality information will also shape demand and improve financing. 

A key focus should be on economic development and supporting public-private partnership. With private sector engagement there should be a strong emphasis on innovative strategies to address urban programming needs. 

Another urban context requiring programming attention is emerging settlements in small towns by pastoralists who are used to mobile lifestyles. In general, these settlements are not formally recognized. They also tend to lack social infrastructure, such as health care and education facilities. These circumstances can lead to infection, malnutrition and poor health outcomes that need to be addressed both within the community and through outreach.

Fundraising and private sector engagement
With the changing aid environment, UNICEF’s unique influence at both the grassroots and ministry levels provides numerous pathways to advocate for children’s issues and leverage resources to ensure strong services for children and women. Meanwhile, opportunities are growing to explore non-traditional ways of directing resources toward children, including jointly negotiated proposals that clearly reflect programme convergence, private sector alliances and innovative financing mechanisms that provide resources through public/private agreements.

UNICEF Kenya’s resource mobilization strategy for the 2018-2022 country programme was created to ensure that UNICEF will have the personnel, supplies and financial support needed to provide targeted services to children, young people, women and other vulnerable groups throughout the five-year period. It outlines UNICEF Kenya’s overarching approach to mobilizing resources in a country context that has evolved – given the continued and strengthening devolution of government– and the fact that Kenya has been reclassified as a lower-middle-income country and the changing relationship with donors that this entails.

Throughout 2018 UNICEF’s Kenya’s engagement with private companies (e.g. Philips, Unilever, Nokia, Proctor and Gamble (P&G), Lixil and Safaricom) has strengthened, and results are being seen in terms of access to sanitation, breastfeeding rates and availability of maternal and child health equipment. In 2018 UNICEF learned that small-scale initiatives or in-kind collaborations can strengthen its relationship with a private sector partner at the local level and pave the way for potentially larger-scale initiatives.

UNICEF Kenya has learned that when working with private sector companies it should consider engaging stakeholders at many levels and across divisions of labour during the partnership firming stage. In doing so, key stakeholders may be able to provide input and buy-in early on so that prioritization, planning and implementation come naturally in the partnership. UNICEF should diligently continue to engage partners through a variety of opportunities, to demonstrate UNICEF’s value in collaborations and build on solid working relationships.


Programme coordination
Programme coordination needs continued strengthening, as early advantages have been noted as a result of cross-sectoral strategies such as capacity building, and across delivery platforms such as health centres and schools.

For example, one of the reasons for the positive good results in management of acute malnutrition was the joint and coordinated nutrition response with national and county governments and strengthened integration of nutrition commodities into the national health supply chain. Nairobi, Kisumu and the 23 ASAL counties – with technical and financial support from UNICEF with programming and commodities – have successfully integrated SAM treatment into existing health services. UNICEF is advocating for systematic and improved monitoring of coverage at sub-county and facility levels to inform more equitable programme scale-up. Further enhancements to multi-sectoral collaboration remain key to increasing dietary diversity in households.

UNICEF will also strengthen its own and the Government’s ability to deliver integrated ECD services through coordination, collaboration and partnership with several line ministries and national and county governments. Increased integration of ECD in development policies is needed, as is greater influence through advocacy with the Government. Continued technical support is required to enable counties and partners to take ownership of integrated ECD services – including health, nutrition, WASH, protection, HIV and early learning – across national, county and community levels. 

UNICEF is also engaged in efforts to scale up the links between child protection and HIV prevention programming in western Kenya and other affected counties. Child protection and HIV are inherently linked. Reducing the number of new HIV infections in children and adolescents depends on protecting them from abuse, violence, exploitation and neglect. The reverse is also true: preventing HIV will help protect children from these violations. UNICEF is addressing common vulnerabilities among children and adolescents. Sexual violence against children and adolescents is a human rights violation prevalent throughout Kenya that heightens the risk of HIV infection.

Partnerships with other United Nations agencies
As part of UN Reform and modelling ‘Delivering as One’, 2018 saw a strengthening of collaboration and partnership across UN agencies. UNICEF’s collaboration included work with FAO, WFP, UNHCR, UNWomen, United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), United Nations Development Programme, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS), as well as with WHO. 

Collaboration with UNFPA, through the joint programme on female genital mutilation/cutting,  continued to strengthen national protection capacities to comprehensively prevent and respond to the practice. This resulted in complementary cost sharing (reducing the programme budget), joint key prioritization and coordination of partnership activities. Joint planning, information sharing and coordination included attention to the realtive visibility of all involved.

In collaboration with UNHCR, UNICEF continued to address protection vulnerabilities and deprivations for unaccompanied and separated children; one-stop child protection service centres; coordination; information management; and evidence generation and utilization. The two agencies also collaborated across all levels of education programming, ranging from technical support to promote and support refugee education in Kenya – including policy development, joint implementation of quality education service, data management and monitoring implementation progress. Challenges to be addressed going forward include the use of incompatible information systems to capture data on affected populations, which creates duplication and reduces efficiency, and the fact that UNHCR’s humanitarian approach means that it strategically avoids long-term investment in governments’ protection capacity. Finally it is important to manage the expectations of both refugee communities and the Government about what UNICEF is able to do in the education sector.

In the framework of Delivering as One, a Turkana United Nations Joint Programme was developed in 2015. In 2018 UNICEF continued to host the Turkana team in its office in Lodwar and contributed actively to coordination and annual reporting on the joint programme. UNICEF is preparing to provide operational and administrative support to the resident coordinator’s office for contractual services in 2019. In addition to the Ethiopia-Kenya cross border programme, through the Resident Coordinator consultations were held to develop a Uganda-Kenya cross-border programme to address the needs of some of the most vulnerable border communities.

During 2018 UNICEF worked closely with the WFP to produce a rapid assessment report on the HIV response during drought in arid and semi-arid lands in Kenya. UNICEF worked closely with the joint team to organize and hold special HIV and AIDS-related events. Lessons learned from this experience included the need to clearly assess partner agencies financial and technical contributions at the onset of projects/activities, for better coordination and roll-out. 

One major lesson learned from a campaign and communication perspective is to foster early involvement with United Nations colleagues to promote strategic and effective planning and improved the integration of activities. Examples include engagement with UNWomen and government partners around the 2018 International Women’s Day campaign and event, and collaboration with WHO on joint messaging and media events prior to the polio campaign. UNICEF also liaised with the Resident Coordinator on drafting OpEds promoting universal health care.

ESAR,Lesotho,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Goal area 1: The availability of quality and timely data remains a bottleneck in Lesotho. There are discrepancies between the 2018 AIDS estimates, LePHIA estimates and district health information system (DHIS) 2 data. In response, UNICEF and Columbia University’s ICAP programme provided technical assistance to strengthen MoH data management systems and engaged the private sector to comply with MoH reporting mechanisms. Additionally, the MoH received support for conducting a PMTCT data-mining exercise to address the poor quality of DHIS 2 data. The exercise revealed showed that all the registers are properly filled in at facility level, but challenges arise when aggregating results in monthly reporting forms. UNICEF, through the Joint UN Task Team on AIDS, supported the Ministry to assess data quality to determine the true number of people living with HIV, including women who are pregnantand those on treatment, to reconcile national data.

Despite improvements in outcome indicators, quality of care is also an important bottleneck for elimination of mother-to-child transmission (EMTCT) of HIV and syphilis. As a response to reports that facilities were not dispensing nevirapine prophylaxis to HIV-exposed infants, UNICEF supported district sensitization meetings to discuss nevirapine dosing and HIV testing in the context of antenatal care, infant and young child feeding and early infant diagnosis. Additionally, a review of the new ARV guidelines for pregnant and breastfeeding women was carried out, taking into account new evidence on the medication dolute gravir.

Limited coordination of adolescent interventions at both national and district levels was a constraint in 2018. This is further exacerbated by divisions within districts, and within districts between the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the Global Fund, meaning that UNICEF has to partner with stakeholders that are allowed by the Government to implement in the selected district. Limited coordination, compounded by limited investments in primary prevention of HIV for adolescents and young people, led to minimal gains in reducing HIV incidence and MTCT among adolescent girls and young women, as well as in improving comprehensive knowledge of HIV (35 per cent), HIV testing (40.5 per cent) and access to quality, adolescent-friendly health services. As a response, UNICEF supported the MoH to coordinate HIV-sensitive interventions for adolescents through various technical working groups. UNICEF also provided technical assistance to the Global Fund and its primary and sub-recipients to ensure high levels of effectiveness in programme implementation.

UNICEF will continue to support the layering of HIV interventions, which is expected to improve  coverage of HIV testing, condom promotion and HIV knowledge among adolescents. UNICEF will also expand access to these combination prevention measures through community structures, helping adolescents and young people to adopt behaviours that lower their risk of contracting HIV. A major focus for 2019 will be on strengthening adolescent participation in service delivery.

Poor data management and under-reporting during routine immunization was documented during the immunization data quality review implemented by UNICEF Lesotho and WHO. An improvement plan was developed to address this weakness. Weak vaccine and cold chain management practices also continue to be reported, and will be addressed within the effective vaccine management assessment improvement plan.

The delay in incorporating performance indicators for severe acute malnutrition in the DHIS 2 continued to weaken the overall nutrition surveillance system developed with UNICEF assistance in 2017. Inadequate coordination and leadership within government agencies for nutrition and WASH also slowed down achievement of results in these sectors.

Goal area 2: Constraints in 2018 included low budgetary allocations to the pre-school sub-sector and changing government leadership, affecting timely implementation of activities such as registering pre-schools and monitoring. Another contributing factor was the fact that the five ECCD officers that had previously been supported by UNICEF and were to be absorbed by MoET in 2018 had still not been recruited by end-2018, although the process was initiated. UNICEF will continue to engage with MOET on this matter to ensure that the officers are in place by early 2019. The launch of the #EarlyMomentsMatter campaign in November and related meetings with the Parliament’s Social Cluster Committee, along with UNICEF advocacy, is expected to impact budget planning for 2019, increasing the proportion of the education budget allocated to ECE. UNICEF will continue to strengthen advocacy and planning efforts in this area. As part of the BELDS initiative, UNICEF will also undertake a funding gap analysis on ECE in 2019.

Challenges to human resources in MoET’s ECCD unit had the knock-on effect of delaying finalization of early learning and development standards, which were due for completion by end-2018. But the curriculum review, which relies on their completion, had to be postponed to 2019. Two stakeholder meetings were held in preparation for the review.

The Lesotho College of Education’s low annual intake of teacher-trainees continued to slow the increase in qualified ECE teachers. UNICEF expects that the launch of the ECD diploma in 2019 may address this issue, as it will be an accredited programme linked to a primary education qualification. UNICEF will advocate for accreditation of the diploma programme in early 2019, although this could mean that the first cohort of students will not be enrolled until 2020.

Data required for regular monitoring and reporting on key education indicators remains a challenge. UNICEF continues to strengthen the capacity of MoET’s statistics unit, but statistics are still delayed by a year and retrieving data quickly from the existing EMIS is a major challenge. To improve the situation, UNICEF continued to pilot OpenEMIS, though the pilot was scaled down due to capacity issues at MoET. UNICEF plans to engage a consultant to strengthen capacity at the Ministry. A proof of concept based on the pilot will be developed and shared with the Government and partners. A plan for funding rollout and ongoing costs of the initiative will also be developed.

Although the inclusive education policy was approved, data on the situation of children with disabilities remains a constraint. UNICEF worked with key partners, including the MoSD, to plan a situation analysis of people with disabilities for early 2019.

Although the education sector continues to be allocated the highest proportion of the national budget, spending has been decreasing, both as a percentage of the national budget and GDP. As the education sector budget is mainly financed by Government with a small and declining source of funding from donors, this is a significant challenge for improving the quality of education. UNICEF is working with MOET through the local education group to prioritize quality improvement interventions in the next funding proposal submitted to GPE. 

UNICEF continued to support teacher training and inspection to strengthen implementation of the new child-centred curriculum and the CFS framework. Progress on implementation of the CFS framework was slow in 2018, due in large part to budgetary constraints, but an implementation evaluation of CFS was begun. However, due to the current fiscal space, it is likely that budget will remain a constraint. For this reason, resource mobilization informed by the evaluation will be undertaken in 2019.

There is also a need to re-evaluate the approach to teacher training, as this has not yielded significant results. The conventional theory of change on teacher development does not automatically lead to improved performance and learning for children. In 2019 UNICEF will work with MoET to explore different approaches to teacher training, including coaching and mentoring, along with other elements of performance, including accountability through monitoring.

Social norms remain a challenge to non-formal education, as herding is both an economic and cultural phenomenon in Lesotho. UNICEF addressed this issue through C4D initiatives in communities where herding is prevalent, but resources for these activities are limited. A further challenge is the high turnover of teachers, as they are usually volunteers or paid a basic stipend. Implementation of the recently approved non-formal education policy will seek to address this challenge, as it includes provisions for improving teacher engagement and remuneration, as well as their work environment. NFE is severely affected by funding constraints in the education sector, and gains in this area depend on significant financial resources from UNICEF and other partners. Resource mobilization efforts for this work will continue in 2019. 

Goal area 3: Constraints in 2018 included low budgetary allocations for the child protection agenda. This has resulted in almost total dependence on MoSD on UNICEF funding to support two key positions and run programme activities, and means that a significant portion of the annual budget goes towards ministry-based staff salaries. UNICEF continued to lobby the ministry to accelerate the proposed absorption of the positions and increase funding for child protection. The advocacy bore fruit in that the ministry recently absorbed the two positions into its structure, creating opportunities for increased funding of programme interventions.

Another challenge has been poor communication between the MoSD, other ministries, UNICEF and civil society organizations around the ministry’s implementation of activities. This created an unnecessary delay in the completion of, for example, the justice for children (J4C) referral mechanism and standard operating procedures, due to the ministry’s decision to roll out the development of child protection case management and violence against children initiatives simultaneously. UNICEF will advocate for introduction of the J4C referral mechanisms and training modules in 2019. 

The unavailability of robust, comprehensive data on violence against children continues to hamper proper planning and evidence-based programming at all levels. Findings from the 2018 survey on this topic will go a long way toward guiding the work of Government, development partners and civil society on violence against children. UNICEF continues to analyse emerging trends and support both the police’s child and gender protection unit and the Ministry of Justice’s children’s court, to obtain credible statistics on children who have reported abuse and/or received justice services. Survey findings will also help establish a credible baseline for the child protection management information system, which in turn will build a strong case for the country to invest in protecting children from violence.

Lesotho plans to share findings from the survey on violence against children with partners during the first quarter of 2019. In support, UNICEF is organizing a joint webinar with the MoSD, the Ministry of Justice, ICAP, CDC and the UNICEF regional advisor on violence against children to provide guidance on the way forward. Data collected through the 2018 MICS – on child labour, birth registration and child marriage –will strengthen the body of knowledge on the status of child protection in the country and thus inform the proposed development of child protection indicators. A key lesson learned is that evidence is important for developing an effective child protection programme for children.

Slow dissemination and implementation of the CRC committee’s concluding observations and recommendations, under the leadership of MoSD, was another constraint. Following presentation of the report to the UN in May 2018, stakeholders were not updated on the status of implementation of child rights in Lesotho. In response, UNICEF and the MoSD have prioritized multi-stakeholder dissemination sessions in 2019. 

Goal area 4: Poor coordination and leadership by lead implementing government agencies continued to hinder progress in addressing open defecation through the community-led total sanitation approach. Continuous engagement has resulted in the inclusion of such approach in the draft policy document, but delays in formal ratification of the policy and implementation guidelines stalled implementation in 2018. In 2019, UNICEF Lesotho will continue to support the Government to address identified bottlenecks, with particular attention to developing and implementing community-led and school-led total sanitation guidelines and standards.

Goal area 5: UNICEF learned three key lessons in 2018. First, building a shock-responsive social protection system is pivotal to addressing chronic and emergency shocks efficiently and effectively. For example, in 2017 and 2018 the Government increased the coverage of child grant beneficiary families. The rapid implementation of the expansion was possible due to NISSA and a readily available disbursement modality that facilitated rapid targeting and disbursement. Second, formalization of collaboration is key to strengthening programme implementation and accountability for children. UNICEF, with the Ministry of Finance, signed a memorandum of understanding to strengthen public finance for children, which increased the rate of implementation, driven by increased ownership among ministry officials. Third, the programme implementation environment is dynamic; it changes with changes of leadership, time and contexts; therefore, for efficient and effective implementation of programmes, managers should always be watchful. 

Most constraints were in the areas of the enabling environment and supply and demand. The social protection coordination mechanism is not yet functional due to frequent changes in leadership. Overall, system-building interventions and implementation of the community development model advanced slowly, in part due to lack of expertise in the MODS41 and the Ministry of Local Government and Chieftainship. Weak institutional accountability relationships between duty-bearers and service-receivers weaken the overall implementation of social protection programmes.

External interference delayed implementation of NISSA. After NISSA training began, some individuals who had not been selected as enumerators assembled and started demonstrating. The recruitment process had to be repeated, delaying implementation. The MoSD also has only a limited budget to expand the cash assistance programme vertically and horizontally. The Bureau of Statistics (BoS) is mandated to manage data and information, but lacks adequate human resources and budget to function effectively. To strengthen the monitoring and evaluation system, Lesotho needs an M&E policy; but such a policy does not yet exist. Weak accountability relationships between supervisors and supervisees at the BoS delayed implementation of the MICS survey. UNICEF and partners will help the Government to address these challenges and effectively implement planned programmes and associated interventions during the new country programme.

Programme effectiveness

Implementation of the Business Operating Strategy moved slowly in 2018; as a result many planned long-term agreements were not implemented, affecting office efficiency in several areas, such as travel. Implementation of technology for development  is at the initial stage, and more support is needed from implementing partners. In addition, maintaining gender balance in the office proved to be a challenge, despite measures taken during the recruitment process. Another challenge in human resources related to implementation of the staff development committee plan, when some courses were cancelled. Neither the radio room nor VHF radios mounted in vehicles were functional during 2018, but the United Nations Department of Safety and Security hopes to restore operations of the radio room in 2019.

ESAR,Madagascar,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Development partners in Madagascar operated in an unrecognized emergency. Most indicators were alarming. The scale of the required response, for a population that may exceed 25 million people, is at levels that cannot be reached by development partners alone, especially in a context of limited external aid. Poverty remains a structural problem, aggravated by past political instability, natural disasters, environmental degradation, epidemics and growing insecurity.

The Government’s capacity to respond is limited by the inequalities and inequities of regions within the country that face growing isolation because of dilapidated transportation infrastructure. Technical capacity is limited, especially at sub-national level, with lack of motivation, limited basic skills, isolation and limited supervision. Regular allegations of corruption at various levels erode international donor and public confidence in public services. Parastatals drain public resources that could otherwise be used in social sectors. Strikes are common, especially in the public sector. 

Domestic funding of social sectors remains a major concern. Despite economic growth estimated 5 per cent in 2017, the social sector budgets, while growing, remain globally insufficient to respond to needs. The education share of the budget in Madagascar is 15 per cent, (Rwanda spends eight times more per child in education) and a majority of the budget is focused in the capital. Less than two thirds of the 2016 available budget was spent by the Ministry of Health, despite great need.  

Despite a doubling of public expenditures between 2006 and 2016 (to about US$2 billion, not considering inflation which reached 8 per cent in 2018), domestic resource mobilization in Madagascar, shown as a per cent of gross domestic product, is the lowest in eastern and southern Africa, at 15 per cent (2015). Most expenditure in the social sectors are recurrent (such as teachers’ salaries) and little goes to investment. Education (15 per cent of the total) and health (7 per cent) allocations are the highest of the social sector, and among the highest overall, but remain inadequate compared to international engagements. Ministries considered less strategic such as water, family and social protection, justice, or youth and sports fare worse. 

The quality of budget execution---funding that reaches the decentralized authorities and its allocation---is a challenge. Thus the most vulnerable are often the least reached. Even if social sector budgets were increased, they would still face problems such as concentrations of spending at central level (more than 80 per cent in some cases), a lack of capacity for budget execution or justification, frequently fluctuating allocations (finance law regularly modified) and regular corruption allegations at all levels. As a result, families carry the burden when accessing social services. Out-of-pocket expenses for health is estimated at US$ 41 per family per year, for example.

Administrative bottlenecks include excessive centralization, complex importation rules, an inefficient value-added tax system, which also applies to international cooperation and United Nations agencies (unless charged to a ministerial budget), limited planning capacity and logistical management constraints including with inventories, transportation, local markets, fleet management and equipment.  

As part of business continuity, UNICEF Madagascar created three alternate office locations, mitigating displacement risk in the event of unrest, that benefit from strong information, communication and technology support. The situation in the field is more challenging, with limited bandwidth and difficult operating conditions (dust, humidity, insecurity). These constraints, prevalent throughout Madagascar, also impact on the limited ability to scale-up technology for development initiatives.

Limited data is a constraint: there has not been a general population census since 1993 (a new one started last year), a MICS since 2006, nor a national household survey since 2012. It thus is difficult to allocate services (vaccines, for example), complicates prioritization and diverts resources from people and regions in greatest need. The lack of data hinders routine systems, and in emergencies and humanitarian situations the lack of joint assessments or leadership leads to diverging analyses on the scale, scope and response needed. 

Internally, Madagascar’s geographic isolation, and French as a main foreign language in a region where English is predominant, makes recruitment of international experts difficult and reduces the opportunities for South-South exchanges. Even recruitment of national staff, within United Nations agencies but also in the public sector, may be dominated by a few ethnic groups (because of education status, pre-colonial and colonial task specialization, regional inequities). 

UNICEF Madagascar and its partners, starting with the Government and major international technical partners, are working to alleviate these constraints and build a facilitating environment.  

The following are some lessons learned from experience:

There is a need to adopt a systems-reinforcement approach in Madagascar, rather than a project approach, even on large projects or in humanitarian contexts. Decades of vertical, if not parallel or substitutive projects, led to reduced capacity, lack of accountability, reliance on external funding and unsustainable approaches. UNICEF Madagascar is therefore, in each intervention sector, reinforcing sector focus.  

In health, with the health system strengthening approach and strategic support to health system structure (cold chain, drug management, supplies, human resource guidance on training, motivation) and information system. In education, with support to the operationalization of the Education Sector Plan. In nutrition, to reinforce the link between nutrition and health at highest level and reduce the gap between the focus on severe acute malnutrition and more worrisome, yet under-funded chronic malnutrition, and early childhood development. In child protection, the step-by-step design of a national protection strategy.  In social protection, the design of a national social policy strategy, and regular review and advocacy around budgets. And in WASH, the structural reforms of the water code and linking WASH components under a single approach. WASH and other sectors recognize the need to focus on strengthening the quality of service delivery at decentralized levels and through the private sector, improving the procurement practices, monitoring, and capacity of actors.

System reinforcement does not mean only policy support. UNICEF Madagascar’s presence at community level and access to high-level political strategy can be capitalized upon. UNICEF Madagascar’s field knowledge and experience can support decision-makers. UNICEF is working to develop child-friendly communities in all sectors with support to thousands of community health workers, community nutrition workers, WASH community mobilizers, and communication for development relays. Inclusion of a community into systems, such as bottom-up planning at regional level or approaches to integrate workers into regular framework (FRAM teachers, UNICEF-project health staff integrated in civil service, formalize social protection worker status). Community focus also promotes beneficiaries’ voices via traditional or new media. (Madagascar youth was a finalist in the international one voice competition).

This systems approach requires coordination. UNICEF Madagascar is strategically positioned as secretariat for international financial and technical partners in education, and lead of the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) and de facto emergency cluster. In WASH (UNDAF, cluster), nutrition (Scaling-up Nutrition, UNDAF, cluster) and the cash transfer working group, UNICEF Madagascar addresses the humanitarian-development nexus by focusing on system-strengthening, and building preparedness and pre-crisis partnerships.  

Health is complex to coordinate actors, such as United Nations agencies, and funds such as GAVI, Global Fund, Global Financing Facility, each with a unique managerial system and priorities. 

Based on experience with coordination, positioning can leverage funds to contribute to UNICEF Madagascar’s objectives. Partnership with World Bank is an example, with significant funds (US$30 million) put in a cash transfer programme for household resilience to shocks in southern Madagascar, with which UNICEF Madagascar is associated. UNICEF Madagascar was associated in 2018 with the design of World Bank project to tackle chronic malnutrition (PARN). A USAID health-access project draws on the conclusion of UNICEF-European Union Passoba project, while African Development Bank, KfW Group and World Bank were encouraged to invest in WASH. UNICEF was invited by the European Union to support the social sector intervention in the next European Development Fund.

In this context, insisting on UNICEF Madagascar’s technical role is a key lesson. While the Government remains in the driver’s seat, UNICEF Madagascar staff take a stronger stand when technical approaches are not sound or ethically questionable, involving management when required. Technical support is not limited to central experts, but was instrumental in the field in 2018. A team of 35 field-based staff (within government structure) reinforced counterparts' and partners' daily capacity and translated the central guidance into operational activities. A lesson learned was the staff tendency to specialize advocacy and reporting on their sole field of activity; a refresher training reinforced common knowledge on UNICEF Madagascar programming, vision and role. This field approach will be reinforced in 2019 through the design of regional workplans that identify UNICEF Madagascar's expectations, accountabilities and realisations at regional level.

More evidence generated at the beginning of the cycle would have provided essential end-line and future cycle baselines. A 2012 national survey on the Millennium Development Goals served as baseline for the country programme and the 2018 MICS will serve as its end line. However, development partners’ programmes in Madagascar are designed with an inadequate evidence base, leading to inefficient allocations and sometimes poor programme quality. In 2018, the finalization of several studies and surveys (in addition to the MICS; a violence against children report; anthropological studies on breastfeeding, immunization; an adolescent needs study; access to WASH; and a surveillance system set up for severe acute malnutrition),positioned UNICEF Madagascar as the main knowledge entity for children in Madagascar. Reinforcement of humanitarian performance monitoring; more coherence of SMS-based approaches; and restructuring contract monitoring will be pursued in 2019.

A main lesson learned in 2018 was the role that transversal elements play in programme evolution.The country office designed a new gender strategy. Despite positive indicators (e.g. girls’ access to primary education), the gender gap and explicit/tacit discriminations, sometimes entrenched in local culture or society, can be aggravated by international development partners (using or reinforcing stereotypes). In 2019, capacity will be reinforced by a gender specialist recruited to advise UNICEF Madagascar and the United Nations country team on better gender inclusion in programme, strategies and administrative backgrounds.

Another 2018 thematic lesson learned was that of adolescent programming: the need to ensure that adolescents’ feedback is representative (and not only of literate, urban youth). To identify common outcomes and synergies between programmes requires transition and coordination mechanisms: for example, children who drop out of school being directed to child protection. Without coordination and integration, adolescent programming constitutes a sum of separate activities. UNICEF Madagascar’s focus on empowering adolescents with an education-centred concept provides a coherent, realistic yet operational and scalable approach (200,000 adolescent reached).

The third lesson learned in 2018, in regard to transversal programming, was the extent of climate, environment and energy importance for UNICEF Madagascar programmes. In 2018, UNICEF Madagascar’s participation in UNICEF headquarter strategic moment of reflection, emphasized the need to position UNICEF Madagascar as a whistle-blower regarding the impact of climate, environment and energy issues on children, and create links between the conservation partners and partners oriented on social development. The Climate Landscape Analysis for Children is being reviewed, climate change issues will be better highlighted in annual workplans, and office accountability reinforced to raise awareness and programme efficiency.

UNICEF Madagascar and partners raise awareness and visibility regarding the needs of the island. Despite a 2016 donor conference, more work is required to raise Madagascar’s profile. UNICEF Madagascar has built its internal and external communications portfolio, embracing multimedia (web, movies, celebrity mobilisation, #nextgen donor mobilisation), to broadcast the situation of children in Madagascar. These efforts will be pursued in 2019 with the recruitment of a new communications chief.  

Continued donor diversification is critical for UNICEF Madagascar. The country office will reinforce the link between social sector funding and green and climate finance/environmental protection; and has received funds from the Global Environment Facility (the first UNICEF country office globally) and the Green Climate Fund (applications ongoing).

Current donor intelligence by using Salesforce, and maintaining excellence in partnership management, advocacy and communication to position Madagascar globally remains a UNICEF priority. The country office makes considerable networking efforts with technical and financial partnerships, including with UNICEF National Committees, and positioning on global issues (adolescent, climate change, emergency). 

Working with the private sector will create new partnerships, both in Madagascar and with private sector partners via the UNICEF National Committees. As a schools-for-Africa country, Madagascar can engage in strategic discussions with private fundraising and partnerships and National Committees to outline a regional pitch. Innovations, including the multiple-use water approach and science education, are important to build on, bring to scale and communicate on the impact while identifying opportunities for other programme areas to draw donor attention.

The final lesson learned: mitigating public sector risk by working with the private sector. In 2018, UNICEF Madagascar supported the role and responsibility of private sector in delivering results for children. For example, WASH-trained operators in the drilling sector, regardless of their partnerships with UNICEF, for more sustainable results. In nutrition, UNICEF Madagascar created local cooperatives to mainstream salt iodization. The use of privately-own media in communication for development enabled coverage of Madagascar, with over 200 partners. Reinforced private-sector capacity to support the harmonized approach to cash monitoring will ensure more coherent and neutral reporting of financial assurance. 






"
ESAR,Malawi,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Lessons learned in 2018 – echoing insights gained during the course of the entire 2012–2018 country programme – show that the current programme logic, with its focus on survival, development and protection produced tangible results for children in Malawi, but could be further improved on a re-focus on convergent programming along the lifecycle of a child using existing delivery platforms for integrated service delivery.  

Reflections on progress in 2018 and previous years further underscored that efforts to integrate programming need to be accompanied by a conducive office structure and a staff mind-set favouring effective integration. Lessons in 2018 also illustrated that work on geo- and real-time data and innovation is critical and should be expanded. Gender, a key cross-cutting priority, needs to be further institutionalized to ensure systematic up-take. All of these lessons will be addressed in the new country programme– with its highly integrated structure and strong focus on data and innovation– and through development of a gender strategy and accompanying gender equality toolbox. 

Lesson 1: Convergent programming should focus on the life cycle of a child and integrated delivery platforms
In 2018 and throughout the current UNICEF Malawi country programme, increased efforts were made to engage in convergent programming across sectors, moving away from the traditional ‘thematic silo’ mentality. The country programme structure aimed to facilitate this by working along three integrated components: child survival, development and protection.

Although some successes were registered, it became increasingly apparent that convergence is best achieved by conceptually focusing on children’s lifecycle, acknowledging that, depending on their age, children have very different needs and respond to different types of strategies pitched at different levels of intervention. Second, convergent programming is best achieved by focusing on integrated delivery platforms, thereby maximising the potential of a few existing platforms, such as schools, to provide an array of integrated services.

One example of successful convergent programming in 2018 was the integration of violence screening into routine screening for childhood illnesses, carried out by health surveillance assistants. Through effective cooperation between UNICEF Malawi’s health and child protection sections, violence screening was included in the standard form completed by health surveillance assistants when screening for childhood illnesses, following the provision of relevant training. This initiative, which used one delivery platform (health) for the provision of additional services (child protection), has institutionalized integrated programming within national systems in a sustainable way, thereby ensuring increased effectiveness in reaching children in need of support and improving efficiency.

Another example was the integration of HIV screening into community management of acute malnutrition, which resulted in a significant increase of the number of children with access to anti-viral treatment. This was a result of bi-directional linkages between community management of acute malnutrition and HIV platforms to ensure that children received both services. 

Programme convergence along the lifecycle of a child also emerged as an important lesson. For instance, acknowledging that adolescent boys and girls face very different challenges and respond to different types of interventions than younger children, was critical and indeed underpinned successful programming targeting out-of-school adolescent girls by UNICEF Malawi’s education section,. 

However, neither convergence by life cycle nor by delivery platform were explicit strategies in the current country programme, thus their full potential has yet to be exhausted. This strategic shortfall will be addressed in the upcoming new country programme, which is structured around the lifecycle of a child and centred around a few platforms for integrated service delivery. 

Lesson 2: Convergent programming requires different management structures and a different staff mind-set
Although some successes in convergent programming were registered in 2018, this was largely dependent on individual staff commitment and foresight, as the office structure, along with its reporting lines and staff accountability structures, continued to be strictly sectoral. Staff  were physically sitting with their section, and were largely accountable to their section chief along sectoral results. This lack of an enabling environment and incentives for convergence made integrated programming the exception rather than the rule.

Beginning in 2019, this will be addressed. Some teams (e.g. the team working on school-aged children using schools as the main delivery platform) will be physically integrated by sharing office space, and some reporting lines will be matrixed. Integrated thematic and programmatic task teams will be setup and staff member’s contribution to these teams will be included in their performance reviews.

Lesson 3: Step-up generation and use of geo- and real-time data
Lessons learned from UNICEF Malawi’s 2018 work on data generation, including through the use of artificial intelligence, illustrated the critical potential of this type of work and highlighted its added value to a highly inequitable programming context such as Malawi. Notably, under the umbrella of ‘for people to see’, UNICEF Malawi worked on several proofs of concepts and minimum viable products that contributed to outcomes in education, health, nutrition, social protection and WASH, such as: horizontal communication for real-time updates through a web platform and crop mapping, which combined ground data collection, drone, satellite imagery, and AI technology to automatically classify crop types. This laid the groundwork for improving crop yield estimates, critical to ensuring food security and thereby addressing stunting and other forms of malnutrition.

Going forward this work will be continued and further elaborated, under an integrated task team on data that will be setup, comprising staff working across UNICEF Malawi’s thematic areas.

Lesson 4: Capacity building and professionalization 
Although UNICEF Malawi’s work on capacity building of frontline workers, such as teachers, health surveillance assistants, and social workers (to name but a few) increasingly focused on professionalization in 2018, there is a need to systematize professionalization this work going forward. Ad-hoc trainings must be phased out and replaced by comprehensive packages for professionalization that include coordinated training schedules, certification for trainings, mentorship and aligned performance systems for accountability. 

In addition, professionalization – especially of a workforce that works predominantly with children – must include strong codes of conduct that contain explicit safeguards and effective complaint procedures against all forms of violence.

Lesson 5: Institutionalization of gender-responsive programming and reporting

Despite progress on gender-responsive programming and reporting in 2018, there is a need to institutionalize gender-responsiveness through the provision of practical tools and guidelines. To this effect, a gender strategy with an accompanying gender equality toolbox will be developed in 2019. A thematic task team on gender will be created comprising permanent key staff from across the office whose contributions to the team will be included in their performance objectives and reviews. The task team will provide a platform for discussing joint challenges and identifying joint responses, and will oversee implementation of the gender strategy and toolbox.

Lesson 6: Partnerships with academic institutions and the private sector are critical for effective and evidence-based programming and fundraising, but processes for establishing them are cumbersome and time-consuming
During 2018 UNICEF Malawi continued to strengthen its partnership with the University of Zürich to build evidence on harmful practices, especially harmful sexual initiation rites and child marriage, thereby providing the basis for effective programming and policy advocacy. The results of the study are expected to be published in early 2019 and will closely inform UNICEF Malawi’s interventions on critical issues such as child marriage. A longitudinal panel study to investigate inflection points in child development is also underway. This study, also undertaken in partnership with the University of Zürich, employs innovative approaches to the collection of high-frequency data on child biomarkers, using wearable technologies. 

Partnerships with the private sector also contributed to significant results for children, such as the partnership with New Finance Bank, which helped to push through the launch of the National Girls Trust Fund. Equally, partnerships with Fredokiss and TNM helped to promote U-Report to a youth audience, driving recruitment of U-reporters and making Malawi the world’s fastest-growing U-Report country. 


Lesson 7: Continuous learning and course correction are critical to develop innovative solutions for children
UNICEF Malawi piloted a number of initiatives during 2018 that facilitated and practised continuous learning for eventual course correction. Notably, in partnership with Government, national and international academics, NGOs and the private sector, UNICEF initially developed 15 innovation products. However, evidence at mid-year suggested that only 11 were likely to transition from the ‘proof-of-concept’ stage to scale. As a result, the office re-focused its efforts on these 11 products only. Honest and reflective programming is critical to develop meaningful innovations for children in Malawi and will be continued in the new country programme. 

UNICEF Malawi also supported the development of a national multi-sector nutrition information system, which enabled monthly reporting on key nutrition data. The monthly reports were used by district officials at quarterly meetings for programme alignment, resource mobilization, decision-making and, if necessary, course correction. Notably, during a quarterly meeting it was noted that reporting for Balaka District only covered 15 per cent of the 38 indicators. This was highlighted and corrected, resulting in the district reporting on 82 per cent of all indicators by year-end.

2019 and beyond

In summary, lessons learned in 2018 show the need to re-focus the current programme logic on convergent programming along the lifecycle of a child using existing delivery platforms for integrated service delivery. Critically, this needs to be accompanied by a conducive office structure and staff mind-set for meaningful integration. Work on gender needs to be better institutionalized; work on data and innovation needs to continue, alongside an approach to continuous learning and strategic adjustments; and partnerships with the private sector and academia should continue. In-country fundraising from the private sector will be further expanded, including through private sector fundraising partnerships and by engaging UNICEF national committees.

These lessons will be built on during 2019 and beyond, through the commencement of a new UNICEF Malawi country programme structured around three pillars, two of which follow the life-cycle of a child (pillar 1 - early childhood (0-5); pillar 2 - school-aged children (6-17),and pillar 3, focused on building child-friendly, inclusive and resilient communities to provide an enabling environment. The pillars encompass a convergent delivery platform approach, with pillar 1 working through health and nutrition platforms, pillar 2 through school-platforms, and pillar 3 through decentralized structures. The aligned office structure, including integrated teams and matrix management, will facilitate the required changes. Resources will also be mobilized for each pillar to ensure that traditionally underfunded sectors such as child protection and early childhood development receive funds through integrated proposals, and that cross-sectoral initiatives are adequately resourced. Geo- and real-time data and innovation, as well as strong partnerships with academic institutions and the private sector will continue to feature prominently in UNICEF Malawi’s work. Efforts around gender-responsive programming will be stepped-up through the development of a UNICEF Malawi gender strategy and an accompanying toolbox.

The recommendations from the Education Public Expenditure Review contributed to the Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture identifying inherent inefficiencies in resource allocation and triggered the Ministry in taking action to tighten-up the payroll system. The Ministry also took action to introduce policies to address inefficiencies in education spending.  

As part of the Public Expenditure Review recommendations, UNICEF supported a menstrual hygiene management study under the National School Health Task Force as well as the review of the National Policy for School Health. The Ministry looked into developing a school grants policy in 2019 to better address all the recommendations from the Public Expenditure Review. In order to ensure continued access to education for vulnerable girls, the Ministry will allocate funds from the universal primary education and universal secondary education grants to procure sanitary napkins for girls. The Education Policy Briefs addressing the key recommendations from the Public Expenditure Review will be used for continued advocacy for efficient and effective resource allocation and use. The Head of State of the Republic of Namibia openly called for the Public Expenditure Review model to be emulated by other government ministries to promote equity and efficiency in resource allocation and use. The Ministry looked into ensuring interoperability between key databases, including payroll data and EMIS and examinations data and EMIS. 

HIV coordination and integration

Namibia’s HIV programme has achieved good results thanks to the effective coordination of the multi-sectoral response and delivery of integrated programmes. The National Strategic Framework for HIV/AIDS 2017/18-2021/22 provided a supportive policy framework coordinated through a multi-sectoral high level body. The National Executive Committee, which meets on a quarterly basis and reports to the Cabinet. The National Executive Committee works through thematic Technical Advisory Committees and specialised Technical Working Groups that facilitate specific programme interventions and partnerships. 

To be sustainably addressed, the HIV response requires coordination of integrated and multi-sectoral interventions. The national coordination mechanism articulates the institutional, multi-sectoral HIV and AIDS response, with the aim of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of coordination strategies and the delivery platforms for integrated programmes. 

In Namibia, HIV response is housed under Ministry of Health and Social Services within the Directorate of Special Programmes on HIV, TB and Malaria (instead of in an independent National AIDS Coordination Body, as is the case in other countries). This setup, focuses on the health aspect of the response, and posed coordination challenges given the multi-sectoral nature of HIV.

To enhance coordination and integration, the Ministry put in place a national coordination mechanism - the National Coordination Framework - under the National Strategic Framework. The framework provides planning and programming guidance of the multi-sectoral response in a coordinated and integrated manner. Through the Technical Advisory Committees, various sectors are required to plan and report their interventions based on the indicators and targets set in the framework. Integration is pursued through the SRH/HIV integration guidelines and the integrated school health programme where various stakeholders are able to converge on a single platform including health facility, school or community to implement the HIV programmes. The Ministry of Gender Equality and Child Welfare coordinates child-focused issues under the Permanent Task Force. Those structures provide avenues for integrated programming across health, education, protection, gender and nutrition.

The coordination and integration efforts supported by UNICEF resulted in alignment of funding toward integrated programmes such as the adolescent girls and young women programme, which is implemented by more than three government ministries and civil society organizations, and attracted resources from various donors, including PEPFAR and the Global Fund. Improved coordination has contributed to improved programmatic results that require inter-sectoral coordination, including the decrease of elimination of mother to child transmission rates, from 23.7 per cent in 2005 to 4 per cent in 2018 and achievement of the 90:90:90 targets by women.

The key lesson learned was that although HIV coordination was premised under a single ministry (the Ministry of Health and Social Services), strong leadership and political commitment can be a catalyst for effective multi-sectoral coordination and integration.  The complementary supportive policy framework, including the national coordination framework, strategies and guidelines, were critical for coordination. Despite these accomplishments, intra-ministerial coordination and scaling-up of integrated SRH/HIV should be further improved.

As a next step, the centralized coordination system will be replicated at the decentralized level, including regional and district levels, by strengthening the subnational level coordination structures. To enhance coordination, the change strategy will focus on key populations and vulnerable groups at higher risk of HIV infections and geographic hotspots.

Mobilizing high-level political support for early childhood nutrition through the Southern African Development Community

Through strong evidence-based policy advocacy from UNICEF, the Southern African Development Community member states adopted a call to action for renewed commitment on early childhood nutrition as a regional commitment to accelerate the fight against child malnutrition. This call for action was made during the community’s 38th ordinary session, which was hosted by Namibia. The Secretariat was tasked with exploring opportunities to involve regional and national organisations to support implementation of high-impact nutrition interventions. Ministers also recommended that the Southern African Development Community Council approve the establishment of a nutrition position in the organizational structure to ensure sustained implementation of nutrition priorities in the region beyond 2020. 

A Joint Ministerial Meeting of Southern African Development Community Ministers of Health and Ministers responsible for HIV AIDS was held, with the participation of representatives from Angola, Botswana, Comoros, Democratic Republic Congo, Eswatini, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia, South Africa, Seychelles, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. UNICEF, together with the World Health Organization, UNAIDS and UN Population Fund, supported technical meetings with the Permanent Secretaries from the member states to review the data, presentations and key decisions requested from the Ministers. 

Prior to the Joint Ministerial Meeting, UNICEF, together with other UN agencies, held a series of meetings with line government ministries to indicate support for the preparation of Namibia’s chairing of Southern African Development Community. During the meeting with the Ministry of International Relations and Cooperation, the UNICEF Namibia Representative shared her personal experience in supporting the Kingdom of Eswatini when it chaired the Community. UNICEF’s evidence-based ‘Advocacy Ask’ tool, which highlighted the situation of each sector, including Public Financing for Development, Nutrition, HIV and WASH, as well as ‘key asks’ for each sector, was used for dialogue and advocacy. Similar high-level advocacy meetings were held with the Ministries of Health, Education and Economic and Planning, and with the Presidency, which welcomed the evidence presented in the UNICEF Advocacy Ask document. 

UNICEF Namibia received significant technical support from the East and Southern Africa Regional Office Advisors for Nutrition, Social Policy, HIV and WASH ahead of the 38th Southern African Development Community Summit in developing an advocacy strategy. In-country technical support was also provided by the Regional Office Nutrition Advisor, and a UNICEF Nutrition Specialist was based at the Southern African Development Community.

The Ministers also urged Southern African Development Community Member States to operationalize the 2017 Addis Ababa Immunization Declaration to eliminate measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases by 2020. The Ministers agreed  to prioritize Expanded Immunization Programmes in the region through strategic partnerships to support implementation of immunization activities at district and field/community levels; and to share cross-border and inter-country immunization technical expertise to scale up immunization activities in the region.  The Ministers also agreed to develop proposals for domestic, regional and international resource mobilization to improve funding for immunization programmes; and to establish partnerships with civil society, faith-based organisations, nongovernmental organizations, UN agencies and academia in the implementation of the Addis Ababa Declaration on Immunization. 

Building on this momentum, UNICEF continued to support the Government in enhancing nutrition coordination, notably the re-establishment of the Food and Nutrition Council in the Office of the Prime Minister to provide technical oversight and policy direction for the implementation of nutrition interventions. The elevation of nutrition coordination to the Office of the Prime Minister provided an opportunity for nutrition advocacy toward resource allocations and leveraging of domestic resources toward nutrition. NAFIN will continue to play an advocacy role under the Nutrition Council and act as a convenor of nutrition issues. 

E-birth and E-death innovation

In 2017, UNICEF Namibia introduced a technology for development application for health professionals to notify the birth of a child. The notification reaches a database from which civil registration officials can facilitate and complete the birth registration process with the parents and issue a birth certificate. The system was rolled out to all regions in 2018. 

The e-death notification system was launched by the Prime Minister in October 2018. Like the e-birth notification system, the e-death notification enables real-time, accurate data on the number and causes of deaths, and facilitates the death registration for faster issuance of death certificates, which are needed by family to claim benefits, social assistance or inheritance. This technology  captured the interest of at least one insurance company, as it will reduce insurance fraud. The proposed linkage to the social protection system’s integrated registry is also viewed as an opportunity to make social protection in Namibia more effective and efficient. Several countries in the region have shown an interest in replicating the system.  

The involvement of relevant sectors in this initiative, including the Ministry of Home Affairs (for the Civil Registration and Vital Statistics component), the Office of the Prime Minister (for aligning with e-Governance including inter-operability of systems) and the National Statistics Office, the police, Ministry of Health and Social Services and Ministry of Gender, strengthened coordination among the different actors beyond e-birth registration. The connections forged facilitated work on the gender=based violence protection unit’s database, which requires the cooperation of the same ministries and the police. The collaboration also helped pave the way for integrating social protection systems for the development of the single registry, the drafting of the Social Protection Policy and the linkage of birth registration and child grant application to expand it to include child welfare services.  

Collaboration highlighted issues to be tackled in the new UNICEF country programme. Although national-level stakeholders support the implementation of e-birth and e-death notification, additional buy-in is required at the technical level to ensure effective implementation. Nurses are overwhelmed with administrative requirements that must be adjusted or risk their being perceived as an add-on to core responsibilities and not prioritized. The lack of ownership and clarification of roles at the operational level also must be addressed.

Integrated programme convergence requires time and leadership

In line with the new UNICEF Strategic Plan and the UNICEF East and Southern Africa Regional Office priority strategy, UNICEF Mozambique invested significant efforts to strengthen programme convergence in several programmatic areas. 

The process of programme sections coming together to design a joint intervention requires the development of and agreement to a common vision and goal. It is critical that senior management buys into this vision and engages in the progress. After development of a common vision, accountabilities between sections and team members needs to be clearly defined and agreed upon and reflected in section workplans and staff performance reviews. Regular review is required to cross check that teams are continuing to work towarda common goal. An open communication style among colleagues is needed to ensure that bottlenecks can be identified early on and addressed. Government participation throughout the process is critical becauseits ownership of the convergence approach will be key to ensuring that the integrated services can be scaled up and reach the community level. 

In the case of the integrated social and behavioural change communication on stunting reduction, a series of retreats were organised with participating team members to ensure development of a common vision and integrated workplans. Subsequent meetings reviewed progress and identified bottlenecks. Government participation was ensured throughout the process. 

The design and implementation of the first phase of the child grant was another example of integrated convergence programming. The child grant is a new component to Mozambique’s existing basic social security programme, and the first of its kind in the country. Its conceptual model is based on a cash and care approach to service delivery. It includes an unconditional cash transfer, behaviour changed related to stunting reduction targeted to child grant districts, and case management services targeted to at-risk beneficiary households. One of the main challenges for UNICEF was to support integrated convergence programming by the Government at the national and sub-national level. The sequential process of registration of children, selection of case management beneficiaries, first payment and delivery of care component was coordinated between agencies within national government and between national and territorial levels. It is expected that the whole package of interventions will be in place by the first quarter of 2019. 

While the actual results of the integrated programme convergence cannot yet be measured, UNICEF believes that its efforts in this area are going in the right direction and are helping bring together programme sections and government institutions to develop integrated interventions that will make a difference for Mozambican children.

UNICEF’s convening role can be instrumental but demands patience, perseverance and effective partnerships.

Given UNICEF’s broad and neutral mandate, technical expertise, wide range of partnerships and experience in working both on policies and service delivery at the local level , the organization is well placed to act as a convening partner around sector-wide or new programming approaches. In 2018, UNICEF played an active convening role in most sectors, particularly in WASH and programming for adolescent girls.

Over the past year UNICEF’s WASH programme used its convening advantage in support of the development of a joint fund for the new sector-wide approach for rural WASH and in supporting the development of an innovative financing scheme for small town water supply systems aimed at increasing, diversifying and improving financing to the WASH sector. It is estimated that a US$320 million annual investment is required to reach the WASH SDG in Mozambique, while annual expenditures have averaged less than US$100 million in recent years.

As chair of the rural WASH partner group, and as implementer of one the largest rural WASH programmes in the country, UNICEF was ideally positioned to help bring partners together to explore options for improved financing of the new rural WASH sector-wide approach. 
UNICEF promoted active participation of government officials from the Ministry of Public Works and existing and potential new donors in a transparent and highly participative process to assess the current situation, explore options and reach consensus on a joint fund that would respond to different donor sensitivities while supporting government leadership and a harmonized approach to technical assistance. UNICEF and Switzerland agreed to hire a team of consultants to support the entire process, with significant involvement of UNICEF’s WASH section chief and a senior national officer. The new WASH joint fund includes options to finance through government systems or an external fund manager. It introduces performance-based financing and an investment prioritization system to ensure support to sanitation programming, and develops an algorithm to target geographic disbursements based on a multidimensional poverty assessment. 

UNICEF’s significant time investment and  perseverance in building transparent consensus resulted in the integration of the joint fund into the new rural WASH sector-wide approach document due to be signed by the Government in early 2019. It also resulted in the development of a new draft memorandum of understanding for the joint fund to be signed by the Government and partners in  2019; and the development of an operational manual for the joint fund and partner coordination in the sector and terms of reference for a joint technical assistance team. USAID and Ireland have expressed interest as potential new donors to the WASH sector.  The total disbursement of the Joint Fund was yet to be determined, but initial estimates indicatedthat contributions of approximately US$15-20 million per year will be mobilized.

In 2017, UNICEF supported a feasibility study for an innovative financing initiative to support the rehabilitation and construction of water supply systems operated by the private sectorin 30 small towns. The US$100 million fund would consist of blended financing including grants, concessional loans and private sector loans channelled through a public private partnership. The results of the feasibility study were endorsed by a steering committee composed of key government agencies and sector partners. The results were subsequently presented to the former Minister of Public Works, who recommended that UNICEF pursue the initiative as part of its 2018 annual workplan.

UNICEF worked throughout the year to engage stakeholders on this initiative, including the Government, especially the new Minister of Public Works, as well as the World Bank, USAID and UNICEF Headquarters and its East and Southern Africa Regional Office. UNICEF also advocated with the African Development Bank, USAID/WASHFin, the European Union, the Dutch Embassy, and the UK Department for International Development to partner on the initiative. 

In partnership with the World Bank, a timeline for the initiative was developed. UNICEF will lead and financially support the initial engineering assessment of the targeted 30 towns and the World Bank will lead on conducting the follow-up to the feasibility study through their partnership with PPIAF. USAID/WASHFin tentatively agreed to support the further development of the initial financial model for the scheme. The Fund’s structure will likely change as the initiative moves forward, potentially looking at additional innovative financing models that will expand the original scope and cover other WASH sub-sectors. Initial indications from the World Bank suggest that upwards of US$300 million dollars could be mobilized. UNICEF is ideally placed to leverage various stakeholders’ engagement for increased fiscal space in the WASH sector. A key lesson learned from the initiative was that there is significant interest from both development partners and the Government on innovative approaches to financing. There needs to be directed, consistent advocacy to push the agenda forward. UNICEF is well positioned to fulfil this role. 

Mozambique had some of the worst indicators for children and adolescents, particularly girls, across different sectors. Adolescent fertility and child marriage rates were high, at 46 per cent, and 48 per cent, respectively. The Government and UNICEF are fully committed to promoting the development, participation and protection of adolescents and young people in line with the UNICEF’s Gender Action Plan and Strategic Plan (2018–2021). UNICEF decided to strengthen its convening role to strengthen the coordination of increasing investments aimed at empowering adolescent girls in Mozambique by investing in a strong working relationship with the UN Population Fund, the World Bank and the Government. This was facilitated by the existence of several joint programmes focusing on adolescents and gender equality (the Joint UN Action for Girls Programme known as Rapariga BIZ, the Spotlight Initiative, the UNFPA-UNICEF Global Child Marriage Programme, and a new World Bank programme focused on harnessing the Demographic Dividend). Those joint programmes aim at very similar outcomes and work with the same government institution. If properly coordinated with organized synergies they represent a great opportunity to advance programming for adolescent girlsover the coming years.UNICEF, in close collaboration with the UN Population Fund, provided leadership in advocacy and provided technical assistance to strengthen the government-led coordination mechanisms both at national and sub-national levels.

UNICEF convened partners, including the UN Population Fund, UN Women, the European Union, the UK Department for International Development, Canada, Sweden and the World Bank.The robust working relationship with the UN Population Fund acted as an accelerator to push for strengthened and harmonized coordination in this programmatic area. 

Government capacity, both in terms of the actual number of technical staff as well as their qualifications, skills and knowledge, was one of the biggest challenges for UNICEF’s support to government service delivery. Areas such as nutrition, social work and sanitation suffered from significant lack of staff at the district level. Most districts did not have social workers, nutritionists or sanitation technicians and in the rare case where they did they were often not qualified. Those limitations posed a great challenge to subnational capacity development in these programme areas.

Several years ago, UNICEF established a process to financially support the recruitment of qualified technicians (mostly in sanitation) to give the districts and the provinces time to integrate the new technicians in the government payroll. Staff  were recruited by the Government using government terms of reference, salary scales and recruitment processes. This arrangement allowed UNICEF to invest in capacity building and have qualified people advance WASH in their districts. With the financial crisis in 2016 and the resulting wage freeze it became more difficult for districts to integrate new staff into their payroll and the capacity issue further deteriorated as retiring or departing staff were not replaced. UNICEF expanded the arrangement to other priority areas such as nutrition and social work. The financial cost of supporting the recruitment of such staff is relatively low and is offset by addressing the risk of ineffective capacity development. In 5 to 10 years, once the revenue of mineral resources starts coming in, sustainability will no longer be a problem, as districts should have sufficient resources to integrate these technical staff so that they continue supporting their sectors.

"
ESAR,Rwanda,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
UNICEF’s new country programme launched in July 2018. It benefited from a 2017 analysis of the situation of children and women and followed by extensive consultations within UNICEF, the Government, and both UN and non-UN development partners. The programme follows UNICEF’s global strategic plan and is closely aligned with priorities laid out in the National Strategy for Transformation and with the UN Development Assistance Framework. The approach includes promoting stronger integrated programming across sectors to address all dimensions of children’s rights; strengthening the use of data to inform policy decisions at the central level; building capacity for programme delivery at a localized level; and sensitizing citizens and children about their rights and the importance of accessing the services offered..

During 2018, UNICEF facilitated four South-South delegation missions from Nigeria, Rwanda, and South Sudan to increase and facilitate knowledge exchange in the area of government-led rural sanitation programming, health insurance, community system health strengthening and human papilloma virus vaccination programme.

As part of the national strategic planning process, the Government of Rwanda made some significant changes to its internal structure and governance, which affected the achievement of some results, while also opening new areas for collaboration in providing technical assistance and capacity building. The consolidation of all nutrition and early childhood development interventions for children 0 to 6 years old and some WASH and health initiatives under the National Early Childhood Development Programme led to a shift in responsibilities for coordination and implementation among government agencies previously in charge of separate components of nutrition and early childhood development. The process of adjustment for those separate entities to work as one slowed the implementation of some nutrition activities. It also delayed activities planned to strengthen the national systems for kitchen gardens and community-based saving and lending. In the area of child protection, the limited number of professional social workers and psychologists in the government organogram led to a high burden of child protection cases and limited prevention and response ability. 

While the integrated National Early Childhood Development Programme is likely to improve its coordination in 2019, similar needs are bound to surface in other social services as central capacity is delegated to local systems. As an immediate response to help the institutional transition toward a decentralized, integrated approach to service delivery, UNICEF helped the National Early Childhood Development Programmere vitalize the micronutrient powder programme by supporting an orientation for all heads of health centres and helping strengthen the national supply chain for nutrition commodities. UNICEF also developed a project to model kitchen gardens and community-based savings and lending groups for poor households to be scaled up by the Government with limited external support. The integrated approach to addressing children’s rights and welfare is directly aligned with UNICEF’s objective. In the long term, UNICEF will continue to support the Government in setting up integrated programmes, providing model activities and capacity building for decentralized coordination, planning and monitoring, and continuing to support central-level policy development, system building, monitoring, and use of evidence for decision-making. There is a need for more advocacy and support to ensure that child protection is better understood and that child protection services are valued.

Capacity needs for quality and integrated service delivery at decentralized levels
Despite its successes, the national early childhood development programme continued to face challenges, including low access to integrated services, especially for rural communities; insufficient funding to cover the needs, despite government allocation to districts and investment from different development partners; and a low quality of services because of inadequate infrastructure and reliance on largely untrained volunteer caregivers. 

In nutrition, the quality of human resources and of the services they provide, as well as the capacity to meet needs to scale are a constraint, as only 55 per cent of children identified with SAM are admitted for treatment in health facilities.

Major challenges in the quality of education were evident through low learning outcomes. Quality was impacted by double-shifting, poor teacher capacity, high pupil to teacher ratios and lack of teaching and learning materials.

Major challenges remained in ensuring the capacity to prevent and respond to all child protection concerns. The size and capacity of the workforce was limited. Few social workers and psychologists were qualified to deal with statutory child protection cases and reporting was low. Child protection community workers (IZUs) need more capacity development and training. The coordination of child protection at the sector and cell levels was weak, which limited integrated case management. 

UNICEF learned several lessons regarding how to improve the integrated delivery of quality early childhood development services. Effective community mobilisation and involvement of district authorities from initial stages of the project are critical for local ownership and sustainability. Home-based early childhood development centres provide opportunities for additional children to access services, especially in remote areas. Income generating activities empower families to support their children’s early learning and education. Provision of integrated early childhood development services is important for holistic child development, thus services that link good nutrition, child and maternal health to hygiene, sanitation and support to early learning must be promoted. Periodic joint planning and reviews with community stakeholders are keys to successful project implementation. 

Lessons learned in education included that interventions at the pre-service teacher training level are more systematic and sustainable than at in-service level. Child protection services are all fairly new, and there is a need to ensure that capacity is being continuously built with the social workforce, including on issues such as disability, and that services are better coordinated on the ground through improved protocols and integrated case management. 

The partnership with tea companies and cooperatives was an opportunity to reach needy children and their parents with services. Going forward such partnerships remain an area of great potential for scaling up early childhood development services. UNICEF will continue to advocate for increased funding, the development of public-private partnerships and the establishment of safe and stimulating early childhood development spaces. UNICEF also will continue to advocate for the scaling up of parenting education programmes and capacity strengthening of the National Early Childhood Development Programme staff and caregivers.

UNICEF will continue to strengthen community-based nutrition interventions and will improve early identification, referral and counselling systems from community health workers to health facilities and back to improve the nutrition status of children identified with acute malnutrition. In 2019, the quality of treatment will be strengthened through supportive supervisions, refresher training and a mentorship programme planned in collaboration with the national Paediatric Association. UNICEF will continue to advocate for the Government to gradually take over the procurement of commodities related to severe acute malnutrition management. 

UNICEF will continue to work with the Rwanda Education Board to strengthen pre-service training and develop a revised framework, incorporating inclusive education and ensuring gender as cross-cutting theme.  

UNICEF will continue to advocate for an increase in the professional workforce, with more psychologists and social workers to focus on child protection. UNICEF will continue to build capacity of professional social workers and psychologists, as well as 29,674 community child protection workers and local leaders, through in-service training.

Negative social norms and lack of awareness

Negative social norms affected people’s awareness of issues related to the rights of children, and their ability or willingness to request or use social services. Engrained social norms contributed to enabling violence against children and to preventing the reporting of new cases. The violence against children and youth study demonstrated the importance of gender and social norms in driving violence and limiting help-seeking behaviour. One-third of the girls interviewed for the survey believed that physical violence against women was acceptable under certain circumstances. Most boys and approximately half of the girls who experienced violence did not report it. Some of them did not know who to report incidents to, but many believed that violence was not a problem or was their fault. Raising awareness around disability in communities remained a challenge. There was low disclosure of children with disabilities; caregivers did not know how to care appropriately for those children; and service providers lacked the skills to serve them. 

Targeting adolescents with HIV prevention and treatment services remained a  challenge. UNICEF supported a study that will provide data at national and provincial levels to improve understanding of barriers to accessing maternal, newborn and child health and HIV services. The findings will be available in the second quarter of 2019 and will inform UNICEF’s and the Government’s priorities for the coming years toward increasing access to services. 

Negative social norms impeded girls realising their right to education. This was especially evident in the disparity in learning outcomes as well as in the number of girls accessing higher education and TVET.

There is still a need to better understand the reasons for behaviours that negatively impact the rights of children. Rwanda still faced challenges in improving health-seeking behaviour for acute respiratory infections and fever among children under five, and for adolescents testing for HIV. UNICEF supported the Government in studying the barriers to accessing services among those populations. The findings will help identify and scale-up interventions that can improve health-seeking behaviours and address some of the barriers that hinder access to the health system.  

There is also a need for better knowledge on the determinants of some protection issues faced by children, such the drivers of teen pregnancy, and on the legal implications for girls and fathers who are under the age of consent (18 years old). New child protection challenges that may be associated with rapid urbanization and internet connectivity should be assessed, such as increased child labour and exploitation or online protection issues. More evidence is needed on the specific challenges in those areas so that new strategies can be formulated.

Awareness on the rights of children as well as on the services available also needs to continue to be strengthened. Rwanda has made remarkable progress in child protection, but the sector remains nascent, with new institutions developed since 2014, including the National Commission for Children and a new workforce such as the Inshuti Z’Umuryango and the One Stop Centres. There needs to be more awareness at all levels to ensure that child rights are understood and that child protection services are valued in the same way as any other service. UNICEF will develop a communication for development (C4D) strategy that will address the social norms driving violence and other child protection issues.

In its external communication, UNICEF recognised the power of storytelling and documentation for advocacy. In 2019, UNICEF will improve video production and better engage digital audiences through social media. UNICEF faced challenges in 2018 in engaging digital audiences through Facebook. A dedicated social media officer was recruited and strategic digital engagement is expected to increase.

Financing constraints affecting delivery of equitable social services

The decrease of official development assistance to Rwanda and the stagnation of the budget allocations to social sectors created uncertainties regarding how some national priorities to promote equity in access and leaving no child behind can be met. In 2018 that was the case for the education sector, gender programmes and in humanitarian response to refugees.  Only two per cent of the poorest children accessedearly childhood development services, compared to 40 per cent of the richest children. Child protection continued to be underfunded in relation to needs.

Resource constraints should drive better planning and targeting of resources to those most in need. Systematic collection of credible, comprehensive data will significantly improve planning and targeting of resources. The management information systems UNICEF is helping the Government to  develop and the social inclusion surveys and studies UNICEF is supporting should help produce evidence to make best use of resources, better target the people most in need and help unlock new sources of funding. 

The private sector is central to supplying certain goods and services. In WASH, the private sector is critical to the Government’s delegated management system of water supplies. More capacity is needed to more effectively sustain water services. The private sector is demonstrating early results in meeting the demand for affordable sanitation products.  

As the Government of Rwanda shifts toward financing development through domestic revenue, borrowing and increased engagement with the private sector, UNICEF will continue to advocate for a sustained and increased focus on children in both public and private sector expenditures. UNICEF will have to adopt a ‘middle-income country lens’ to ensure that its resource mobilisation strategy and advocacy activities align with and respond to emergent needs, opportunities and trends. Strengthening of the current partnership with Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning will be one of the key strategies to advocate for increased investment in social sectors and their increased impact on socio-economic status of children. The private sector should be involved in providing quality services where possible (e.g., for WASH) . 

Resilience to shocks

The food security situation, which has not improved significantly since 2015, contributed to the persistent high stunting level. Poverty levels have remained stagnant and there was no marked poverty reduction in the last three years, but shocks have become more frequent, including an increase in food insecurity, vulnerability to environmental destruction, and a rise in childhood illnesses, which correlates with a spike in malaria cases in 2015-17. The subsequent use of negative coping strategies points to the low resilience of households to shocks and their continued vulnerability with regard to both monetary and multidimensional poverty. UNICEF needs to continue integrating nutrition, early childhood development and social protection to improve resilience of households against shocks, including by modelling sustainable, scalable, gender- and nutrition-sensitive interventions with kitchen gardens and community-based savings and lending groups suitable for the most vulnerable population.

"
ESAR,Somalia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Working in Somalia was fraught with programmatic, operational, logistical and security constraints. UNICEF was well equipped to overcome those challenges and in 2018 triggered an ambitious move to work even closer to communities, children and women in the country. After more than 25 years of remote operations from Nairobi, Kenya, the UNICEF Country Management Team moved back to Mogadishu in 2018, implementing an unprecedented and in-depth change management process that involved shifting personnel in programme and operational teams and setting up office and accommodation space for the full team to be based from within Somalia. This increased footprint inside Somalia benefited from strong institutional support from all layers of UNICEF, and overall stewardship from the UNICEF Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Office. This change was a considerable step forward in overcoming constraints inherent to remote operations, and brought UNICEF closer to its partners in government and civil society, and closer to the women and children it serves.  

In 2019 UNICEF will further consolidate the strong foothold it has in Somalia and adjust programme and operations considering the inherently higher costs of working from within Somalia. Throughout the entirety of UNICEF Somalia’s change management process in 2018, a commitment was made to a nimble and agile approach, with real-time lesson learning. UNICEF Somalia continuously reviewed its programme and operations footprint to stay fit for purpose for every child in Somalia. A strong commitment to staff support, staff welfare and well-being was transversal to every aspect of the change management process, acknowledging both the depth of the transition after 25 years of remote operations and the challenge of supporting staff to deliver in one of the world’s harshest and most volatile security environments. 

Access and security were continuing and ever-pressing challenges. This was true in the Central South regions of Somalia, where there were considerable numbers of internally displaced persons in need of lifesaving services, and continuing conflict and vulnerability to cyclical shocks such as drought and floods. Those access and security challenges also extended to many other districts of the country, with insecurity in the disputed areas between Somaliland and Puntland, particularly in Tukaaraq, which was a continuing flashpoint over the course of the year. Access constraints complicated efforts to reach full coverage of humanitarian and development programmes such as the polio and other vaccination campaigns, reaching malnourished children in remote rural areas or protecting children from forcible recruitment. 

There were also inherent challenges related to the very nature of programming in Somalia. With respect to health and nutrition programming, one lingering challenge related to immunizations was that coverage was calculated based on administrative data, and in the absence of recent immunization coverage surveys, coverage rates need to be nuanced while efforts to extend the reach of the immunization programme need to be maintained. Coverage challenges across most, if not all, health and nutrition services also extended to reaching nomadic and migrant populations, particularly in areas of high insecurity and access constraints. Efforts to improve health and nutrition came up against many residual weaknesses in the Somali health system, which remained highly fragmented. Ministry partners, for example, still lacked the necessary number of skilled cadres in planning, managing, monitoring, supervising and coordinating programmes, while the subdivision of the country, including with the creation of the Federal Member States, added complexity to coordination, decision-making and priority-setting and for the health (or any other) system to work as a single coherent whole. Capacity gaps remained high in the newly created Federal Member States and more investment is needed to boost staff, systems and infrastructure at those levels. Clan dynamics strongly influenced how civil society operated, including in relation to government counterparts at local and national levels. This was a challenge not only in health and nutrition but across all sectors. In this context of fragmentation, achieving programme integration and sustainability is a complex challenge.  

Funding the transition of polio-specific efforts into improved routine immunization systems and sustained high expanded immunization coverageremained a challenge. Integration of moderate acute and severe acute malnutrition services still needs to be improved, with widespread disparities in programme availability, particularly in the south. Lessons moving forward include investing in further rationalization of partners in various locations as well as the implementation of the expanded admission criteria for treatment of moderate acute malnutrition in areas where there were no such services. 

In the education sector, one of the key lessons learned revolves around the use of Somali national nongovernmental organizations as a more cost effective and efficient approach that contributes to building local ownership. Another key lesson was that the evolution of governance in Somalia with the new Federal Member States requires a fresh approach and development of micro-plans for the Federal Member States to gradually become full-fledged local partners in the education sector. One significant constraint  was that the sector remained heavily under-financed by both government and development partners, and was one of the areas suffering from the greatest funding shortfalls in 2018. The Government demonstrated its commitment to education in the National Development Plan 2017-2019 and the Education Strategic Plans 2018-2020, but challenges remained in matching those commitments with resource allocations. Maintaining community-based approaches and Somali-led co-financing thus remain necessary approaches to enhance community contributions to education, and will be supported in the coming years with an increased focus on social policy budget analysis and tracking, drawing on UNICEF’s strengthened focus in those areas for the 2018-2020 cycle and beyond. Another challenge, particularly with regard to strengthening systems that are the necessary backbone for the education sector, was delays with the publication of the Annual Education Statistical Year Book, due among other things to a change in the development partners working in the education sector in the south. This limited the ability to report on progress in the sector, with knock-on effects on strategy development, priority setting and advocacy for resource mobilization. Going forward, UNICEF will continue to engage with donors and partners to make up for the gap in education data collection. 

To build a stronger and more protective environment for children, constraints observed and lessons learned in 2018 included first and foremost the need for more robust interventions at the community level, notably to address child recruitment by armed groups, regional forces and clan militias. This requires strengthening community-based child protection mechanisms, targeting regional authorities, clan elders and religious leaders to prevent child recruitment, promote positive social norm changes (on child marriage, sexual and gender-based violence, and female genital mutilation/cutting), and investing in innovative socio-economic services for adolescents and young people. Sustained and coordinated advocacy with the rest of the UN system, the diplomatic community and civil society organizations involved in child protection is needed to secure positive outcomes for children. UNICEF Somalia will seek to more strategically leverage resources and play its convening role on high-level advocacy issues such as access to justice for children, civil registration and vital statistics (including through partnerships with the World Bank), and child legislation consistent with the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  

There is a need for a coordinated approach to welfare workforce strengthening so as to minimize resistance to change and innovations in child protection systems. The social service workforce curriculum could not have been developed without the mobilization of both universities and Federal Government of Somalia’s Ministries. More investment is needed in working specifically with adolescents and youth. Youth represent a majority of the population and their opportunities to contribute positively to the country’s future need to be nurtured. Youth engagement and participation programmes will be essential in building a truly protective environment for every child in Somalia. Much remains to be done to address the silent plight of children with disabilities, a regularly overlooked issue in Somalia that cuts across all programmes and where data is scarce and there are few partners to work with to address needs. Somalia’s signing onto the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2018 and UNICEF’s global expertise in this area provide opportunities to address this continuing challenge in 2019 and beyond. 

Key challenges in WASH included the lack of long-term development funding, high costs in the provision of services and limited capacity of implementing partners and government line ministries. More support and long-term investment is needed to accelerate certification of more communities and districts as open-defecation free and to maintain achievements in good hygiene and sanitation behaviours. Water quality continued to be a challenge and a more robust water quality and surveillance system was being proposed, drawing on the positive lesson learned in the establishment of the Puntland State Agency for Water Energy and Natural Resources water quality lab and repair centre. That new model tested in Puntland allowed for more robust water quality monitoring in the region and proved to be a solid and sustainable approach to strengthen and embed water quality monitoring capacity in local partners. Despite capacity issues, greater engagement for direct service provision through government ministries and departments was promising. Enhancing their capacity will be a priority, as they offer good opportunities for sustainability and immediate response when needed.  

Urbanization and displacements due to drought and conflicts continued to be a major problem in planning and implementation of projects for sustained access to basic WASH services. This requires innovative and more strategic focus on resilient urban WASH interventions, including establishment of public/private-managed solar powered water supply schemes, drilling of deep strategic boreholes and construction of sub-surface water dams along dry river beds, as well as expanded investment in climate resilience interventions in a context where Somalia remains highly drought-prone. Key resource partners, including the United Kingdom, have been brought on board to support the drilling and equipping of four deep boreholes in strategic urban locations with critical needs. For rural areas, ongoing German- and Dutch-funded resilience programmes offer greater opportunities for enhanced access to WASH services. 

Key lessons learned in communications revolved around engaging more with media and youth. In 2018, for example, more than 100 media practitioners and 40 youth received child rights and media training and blogging training, increasing their capacity to promote and protect child rights and let their voices be heard. Four Somali changemakers were supported to participate in the African Youth Conference. In 2018, a range of public advocacy tactics continued to highlight the situation of Somali children and women affected by drought, conflict and violence. Seven field trips were organized for international media and donors, including the Danish UNICEF National Committee, to bring much needed attention to the ongoing crises and to support fundraising. High quality multimedia products, such as photographs, videos and personal testimonials, were produced and disseminated to highlight challenges and progress, including the EU-UNICEF Urban Water Project inauguration in Somaliland, Children on the Move in Puntland and Somaliland. UNICEF Somalia expanded its social media presence.  The number of Twitter followers increased by 20 per cent, gaining 1.3 million impressions (cumulative), and Facebook increased by 30 per cent, gaining 346,000 engaged users (cumulative). Social media channels also were used for donor visibility. Together with partners, UNICEF also conducted communication/child rights training for nongovernmental organizations, government, the media and young people.

In the areas of social policy, monitoring and evaluation, one key challenge was the quality and availability of general macroeconomic and poverty data to advance the policy and advocacy drive toward equity. Lack of an updated census and security threats to enumerators meant surveys could not achieve full geographic coverage and had to be carried out with shorter versions of questionnaires. Regular collection of administrative data suffered from limited government capacity, significant fragmentation across partners and limited incentives for data-sharing. While continued investment in the statistical capacity of key government institutions, consolidation of administrative data and regular surveys are important, developing new sampling methodologies and innovative data collection approaches need to be a priority. Beyond data issues, equity and consistency in service delivery for children requires strong inter-ministerial policy work and coordination. There was limited institutional and human resources capacity, with a constant phenomenon of high turnover of ministry staff. UNICEF will invest in government capacity building and expand its partnership with the central Ministry of Planning in Mogadishu, while also leveraging its new setup in-country to be able to deliver in all circumstances.  

Several cross-cutting programmatic areas will be further explored, including resilience, which will continue to be a pivotal entry point. Coordination issues at the macro-level in resilience programming can translate into district-level gaps and service delivery not being in sync. The absence of country-wide and integrated resilience building efforts remains a challenge. UNICEF will work with the World Food Programmeto address this gap in collaboration, implementing a multi-year German-funded resilience project in areas of Central South with hopes that the programme can be scaled up. Lessons from the current resilience approach to service delivery provide critical evidence to develop a scalable model adapted to Somalia, one aimed not only at addressing health, malnutrition and stunting, but also designed to expand to new components in 2019 to cover all key sectors for children, with the hope this can deliver on giving every child a fair and equitable start in life.

Constraints

Despite progress and gains made in advancing child rights and well-being in South Africa, significant implementation gaps remain between progressive policies and actual investment in the social sectors. Another unfinished agenda item is related to the goal of ensuring equitable access to quality social and protection services for children, due to the following constraints: increasing political uncertainties, sub-optimal inter- and intra-sector coordination, insufficient implementation capacities, deep-rooted social prejudice and norms and limited financial and human resources.

Political uncertainties in South Africa adversely affected continuity of policies, strategies and priorities, thereby negatively impacting on results for children. After a Cabinet reshuffle in February 2018, the new Cabinet focused on creating jobs and employment and reducing dependency on the state. If the national plan of action for children is to become a truly useful document, it requires new medium-term targets and indicators, which will only be available after the May 2019 national elections. This led to the deferral of the finalization of the NPAC until middle 2019. In addition, the provinces restructured district health management teams and reviewed their human resource structure with the main goal of gaining efficiency and adjusting to the budget constraints, but the uncertainties associated with restructuring caused a delay in moving key initiatives and interventions forward. 

Continued ineffectiveness of inter- and intra-sector coordination constitutes a major constraint to optimal intervention in key areas. One of the key challenges for a range of education programmes was sub-optimal coordination among all stakeholders when implementing evidence-based solutions. UNICEF South Africa, together with the DBE research branch, scientifically identified the most effective intervention modality for improving learning outcomes through a randomized controlled trial, but the modality was not implemented as effectively and efficiently as expected due to difficulties in coordinating different layers within the DBE. While training in the multiple overlapping deprivation analysis methodology proceeded well in 2018, coordination challenges between Europe-based trainers and senior staff in Statistics South Africa (impacted by Government austerity measures) slowed down implementation. Despite the Government’s commitment to working together on violence against children and women – with different line departments through the technical task team and provincial coordination structures–coordinating actions across programmes and departments and between different DSD layers posed a challenge to addressing violence effectively. 

Weak capacity for implementation, in spite of strong legislation and policies, was also a constraint to delivering front-line services for children and their caregivers. Capacity constraints in government departments varied both across and within the branches and across the provinces. Since these impeded the achievement of several key results, UNICEF South Africa frequently was required to augment capacity with its own resources, intended for use in other programmes. In addition, resourcing key game-changing interventions was not always prioritized in sector resource allocation at all levels, due both to competing priorities and insufficient capacity to adjust priorities. Additionally, data to inform programme implementation was not always produced in a timely and reliable manner. For example, the information management system for the social welfare sector is manual and inefficient, which sometimes hampers timely and appropriate responses. The quality of data being produced by different management information systems also frequently came into question. 

South Africa ranks 27th among the 108 countries covered by the 2014 social institutions and gender index produced by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; the highest ranked African country. South Africa’s high ranking reflects the country’s strong legal framework for gender equality and women’s rights. Despite wide-ranging successful interventions– including those supported by UNICEF such asTechnoGirls and MenCare – anchored in a progressive constitution and elaborate policies, discriminatory attitudes, social norms and persistent stereotypes continued to result in inequitable access to opportunities, resources and power for women and girls and to constrain the translation of outputs into outcome results. 

Lastly, despite UNICEF South Africa’s strong efforts to mobilize and leverage resources for both its own work and directly for government programmes, internal and external funding constraints adversely affected the delivery of results for children. Difficulties around obtaining a tax exemption certificate constitute a major disincentive for corporate donors to commit to major UNICEF donations. UNICEF South Africa will have to be even more creative in its approach to shared-value, multi-faceted partnerships to secure much-needed resources for its programmes. For example, the health programme faced unpredictable and insufficient funding in two areas: support to provincial departments of health, where the need for capacity building was greatest; and for investing in research, data and analysis to better understand and operationalize the linkages between public health programmes and other sectors that impact child health and well-being. The limited budget also negatively impacted UNICEF’s overall human resources. External to UNICEF, the Government also faced budgetary constraints for key interventions; such as the development of reading norms in African languages, which was re-phased to 2019 due to lack of funding.

Lessons learned 

Nevertheless, 2018 was also a fruitful year with new insights and lessons generated to inform course correction and strategy refinement. First, strategically focusing on overcoming a few vital bottlenecks, based on UNICEF’s comparative advantage, proved effective. For example, UNICEF South Africa’s experience with HIV/AIDS programming, especially in a country where the HIV response is funded mainly through domestic resources. With its limited resources, UNICEF South Africa positioned itself to engage in catalytic interventions that fill urgent gaps by moving fast; the approach was highly effective.

In addition, UNICEF South Africa realized that pooling existing resources from all stakeholders, both within and outside the state, to implement nationally agreed solutions yields greater and faster progress. With its convening power, UNICEF South Africa worked to support and potentially direct and improve the use of resources for health interventions from Government, the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the Global Fund by providing policy advice underpinned by strategic analyses and information. UNICEF South Africa also played a key role in supporting the DBE to leverage US$13.2 million  from the United States Agency for International Development to scale up early grade reading findings in 2019/2020. With a clear demonstration of results, development partners are willing to implement strategic interventions that would complement government efforts to achieve optimal results. Partnerships with CSOs and quasi-state agencies were also an effective mechanism for cost-effective programme implementation.

Another lesson learned was that combining evidence-based policy advice and upstream advocacy with systems strengthening at  the mid- and down-stream levels is still an imperative for UNICEF South Africa, as the discrepancy in capacities between the national and provincial/district levels for analysis, planning, monitoring and evaluation causes ineffectiveness and inefficiencies of key interventions. UNICEF South Africa’s WASH in schools programme demonstrates that even in a middle-income country, downstream work is still required to strengthen entire systems, while structural, resourcing and accountability factors are addressed in the system at the upstream level. Unique challenges in some rural areas include a lack of affordable, efficient service systems and services, weak institutional structures and inadequate responses. All these have equity implications in realization of rights. Therefore, UNICEF South Africa needs to focus on strengthening sub-national systems and institutions, particularly in high-burden and low-performing districts, while at the same time supporting improvements in the overall policy and budgetary environments. 

Way forward

With key constraints faced in 2018 and new lessons learned in mind, UNICEF South Africa stands ready in 2019 to tackle existing bottlenecks and newly emerging challenges, as well as deep-rooted underlying causes. 

High-levels of poverty, unemployment, inequality, violence and child rights violations still prevail, undermining children’s and women's day-to-day well-being, despite high-level political commitments to end violence and create jobs. As 2018 was dedicated to leveraging political will, awareness and commitment towards ending violence against women and children, in 2019 UNICEF South Africa will focus on social mobilization to address social norms and achieve behaviour change. Although health outcomes have improved in the past years, achieving ambitious health goals will also require tackling underlying or related factors, such as poverty, education, violence, nutrition, WASH and gender norms, which lie outside the domain of the Department of Health. This necessitates stronger coordination and inter-sectoral collaboration, to which UNICEF South Africa can make an important contribution through its convening power.

To win support for the cause of children, UNICEF South Africa will further expand space for the child rights work nurtured in 2018 and form multiple national coalitions for multiple causes. UNICEF South Africa will support the Government to monitor the effectiveness of policies to deliver results for children across government departments, with a view to helping the Government to prioritize resources and actions and focus on results. UNICEF South Africa will also invest in forming a coalition of reading supporters and mount a major reading campaign to respond to one of the most critical challenges for education: that 78 per cent of Grade 4 learners cannot read for meaning. Work with CSOs to establish a budget justice coalition will also be intensified to ensure child-sensitive, child- friendly budgeting in the country. To leverage accelerated investment in child care and protection, currently underfunded in the state budget, UNICEF will co-host the global child and youth care conference with other key players in 2019. 

UNICEF South Africa will continue to take a dual-track approach: policy and evidence-related work upstream and systems-building work at mid- and downstream, especially in high-burden, low-performing districts. For example, for child and youth care work, parenting programmes and case management, UNICEF South Africa will continue to work on policy development upstream and on service delivery for prevention and early intervention programmes downstream. Additionally, UNICEF South Africa will prioritize addressing implementation gaps in the execution of well-designed policies and plans, and in so doing, test the effectiveness and efficiency of the platforms for multi-sectoral service delivery. For instance, as per the national school nutrition guideline to be developed, delivering essential nutrition interventions through schools and early childhood centres, in collaboration with the DBE and DSD, will be supported to prevent and control overweight and obesity and improved dietary diversity among South Africa’ school children. School-based training on school safety will be rolled out, with a strong focus on preventing gender-based violence, alcohol/substance abuse, off-line and on-line bullying and road injuries among children. 

To carry out the interventions described above –social and behaviour change, strengthening sector coordination, developing/ leveraging strategic public and private partnerships, policy advocacy and institutional strengthening of national and sub-national systems –UNICEF South Africa will ensure that its interventions are evidence-based, innovative and adequately financed. 

Data quality issues affected the interpretation of immunization coverage data, resulting in discrepancies of over 10 per cent between WHO/UNICEF estimates of national immunization coverage and the country’s official estimates, highlighting the need for a rigorous survey to accurately estimate vaccination coverage in South Africa and accurately explain the reasons for non- and under-vaccination. With technical support from UNICEF South Africa and WHO, an  evaluation of the coverage of the expanded programme of immunization got underway in December 2018 and is scheduled for completion by March 2019. Given the critical nature of this survey, UNICEF South Africa will closely monitor the evaluation to ensure that quality data is generated to inform future actions. UNICEF will also complete the multi-dimensional poverty analysis in 2019 and subsequently design an advocacy strategy to urge line departments to use the analysis as a central plank in their strategic prioritization processes. 

UNICEF South Africa will also further strengthen existing innovative technology-based solutions or deploy technology to address new challenges. Existing digital health tools, including MomConnect and NurseConnect, will be further expanded as per a request from the NDH. The ‘Road to Health’ booklet, a guidebook for women who are pregnant and mothers who are lactating on healthy behaviours for themselves and their babies, is currently being tested for digitization. Once digitized, it will be connected with MomConnect, NurseConnect and other platforms. For child protection, the pilot digitization of the case management system will be rolled out, and the outcomes will feed into a process for the creation of a simplified information management system. For education, a number of innovative solutions – including the ECDmobi and TechnoGirl applications – will be advanced, to improve caregiver practices, facilitate knowledge and experience-sharing among youth and enhance the capacity of education service providers.

South Africa is a middle-income country competing for investment for children with countries affected by war, humanitarian disasters and poverty –although the differences for some social indicators are minimal. Thus there is a need for innovative fundraising and financing for South Africa’s children. As proven effective in 2018, UNICEF South Africa will continue to develop and leverage resources and partnerships for children; for example, sourcing and channelling cash and in-kind contributions from private-sector donors directly to UNICEF implementing partners. Based on the 2018 experience, which showed that corporates value UNICEF’s expertise and advice but prefer to channel funds to local entities, UNICEF will adopt a segmented resource mobilization approach going forward. This will include a focus on private foundations and high-net-worth individuals, including through UNICEF national committees, to fund UNICEF directly, along with strategic engagement and leveraging local corporates and private foundations to invest in priority programmes for children implemented by Government and other local partners. To further expand UNICEF South Africa’s partnerships, the office will also expand engagement with UNICEF’s regional office, headquarters and national committees as part of the multi-country ‘schools for Africa’ campaign. In addition, following a positive review of South African market potential for individual giving, the office is developing a new individual giving strategy, with a focus on pledges, for implementation in 2019. 

The coming year will be the last full year of the current country programme. During 2019, UNICEF South Africa will comprehensively review results achieved to date and the theories of change underpinning the current country programme. It will work with the UN country team to develop a new strategic cooperation framework to support implementation of the new Government five-year implementation plan for achieving the goals and targets of the 2030 national development plan and the SDGs. The platforms UNICEF South Africa has leveraged and consolidated to date will help the office to strategically position the child rights agenda in the country and address the many issues affecting children.

Resilience and development
The operating context in South Sudan is ever evolving and measures that require a continuum of care, such as education and some vaccination programmes, are particularly vulnerable. This requires an agile approach to programme design, implementation and monitoring, such as by prepositioning health and other critical supplies during the dry season to ensure continuity of essential services and preparedness for outbreaks occurring in the rainy season, when roads are impassable and airlifting costs are exorbitant. To reduce high operational costs, integrated delivery of health and nutrition services was advanced, such as joint screening of malnutrition and malaria among children and providing malaria and diarrhoea treatment through OTPs. Programmatic responses have been severely impeded by weak governance, a lack of qualified health workers and a dearth of data. In response, UNICEF will continue to focus on improving coverage by strengthening the quality of basic interventions. Moreover, UNICEF will build the capacity of community health workers, faith-based and community-based organizations, while ensuring that a parallel core supply chain system is in place that can be triggered in the event of an acute crisis to ensure that basic services are delivered to children and that core commitments are met.

This agile approach needs to run in parallel with a move towards longer-term, risk-informed development, which supports equity and human rights and breaks the cycle of recurrent crisis and dependence on humanitarian support. The preventive agenda needs to be given equal priority with the responsive agenda. UNICEF needs to focus on building resilience and capacity at the sub-national and household levels to achieve equitable results for children and women. For instance, by using community volunteers to expand the reach of birth notification beyond static health facilities.

Due to ongoing insecurity and large-scale displacement there is demand for life-saving services, but no sustainable community engagement, which compounds regressive socio-cultural behaviours. Community engagement is also problematic due to the disintegration of local structures, a lack of suitable implementing partners and difficulty in measuring the impact of behaviour-change communication. Efforts will be made to address these issues through, for example, mainstreaming evidence-informed, gender-responsive C4D methods to engage with households and communities in support of behavioural and social change. 

UNICEF will increasingly emphasize community-based protection and comprehensive case management services. Community social groups with a traditional care function – such as teachers, PTAs/SMCs, social workers, caregivers and child protection volunteers – will be reactivated and strengthened. Referral mechanisms and supportive programmes will be established to enhance protection of children and adolescents in communities. UNICEF will prioritize community participation to increase the likelihood of sustainability when projects end or access is interrupted.

Vital to enhancing development prospects is the need to continue to strengthen national information management systems for enhanced planning and good governance, including: civil registration and vital statistics and operationalization of the district health information system II to support decentralized health care service delivery. Meanwhile, investment in evidence- generation and innovative data collection methods will continue, with priority given to new systems such as those for sentinel monitoring and digital field programme monitoring. UNICEF will explore the use of innovative mobile phone technology to transmit data in real-time to inform programming, as well as standardization of data collection tools and verification protocols. 

Partnerships
Partnership with CSOs is critical to delivering results in South Sudan. In line with Grand Bargain commitments, UNICEF is the largest supporter of national CSOs in the country, with 45 per cent of implementing partner resources transferred to national partners in 2018, exceeding the UNICEF Strategic Plan target of 31 per cent. UNICEF South Sudan is working on an innovative approach to developing multiyear agreements with partners, especially in nutrition and education, to improve predictability and continuity in response delivery and build strong, longer-term partnerships. 

Programme reach could be broadened through investing in UN joint recovery and resilience initiatives that develop capacities of communities and local institutions and strengthen linkages between development and humanitarian programming. In partnership with Global Health Partnership members, the Gavi Alliance and other development and humanitarian actors, UNICEF will prioritize agile, integrated, and coordinated approaches to reaching SDG 3 targets, allowing some of the inextricably linked determinants influencing MNCH outcomes to be addressed. The World Bank’s famine action mechanism, for example, could strengthen partnerships in food security and nutrition. 

Donor support was actively acknowledged through the production of more than 10 visibility plans and 28 donor field visits to showcase UNICEF’s work, resulting in improved funding and interest in South Sudan. Successful GPE, World Bank and German Development Bank proposals have solidified partnerships for UNICEF’s work in South Sudan. 

Multi-sectoral and cross-cutting strategies
The myriad inter-dependent deprivations call for linkages between sectors and closely harmonized cross-sectoral prevention and response packages to achieve efficiency and impact at scale. Integrated programming, advocacy and monitoring have proven effective in producing shared outputs, increasing the reach and quality of services, reducing costs and improving funding opportunities. 

For example, there are major cross-sectoral drivers of food and nutrition insecurity in South Sudan and UNICEF is the only agency that can integrate all vital sectors to address malnutrition, particularly stunting. Immunization will be used as a nationwide platform, under which other life-saving child health interventions will be offered. Other integrated service delivery platforms will be optimized, such as treatment of common childhood illnesses and services related to birth registration and gender-based violence, in the nutrition OTP. UNICEF will continue to embed nutrition interventions in school programmes, as well as in ECD activities at nutrition facilities. 

The WASH section will continue to place a strong emphasis on joint work with UNICEF’s nutrition, health, education, child protection and C4D sections, to maximize its contribution to reducing child morbidity and mortality, stunting and malnutrition and to support the prevention of gender-based violence. Humanity & Inclusion is working closely with UNICEF’s partners on social inclusion of persons with disabilities at Bentiu and Juba PoC sites. WASH initiatives include support from partner Solidarités International to provide disability-friendly latrines. However, mapping on disability needs and gaps is required as is investment in programming on disability and inclusion, through an integrated approach across sectors.

In 2018 the importance of integrating child protection services into other sectors was demonstrated through the successful integration of birth registration and clinical management of rape in programming for gender-based violence, health, nutrition, WASH, and IRRM, as well as the integration of psycho-social support in education services. The education programme will incorporate and complement child protection, C4D and gender-sensitive WASH facilities to deliver a comprehensive package of services. The provision of gender-sensitive WASH facilities and child protection services help make the school environment more child-friendly, while C4D activities mobilize communities in support of education. GPE and education-in-emergencies interventions will continue as complementary for access and quality education through common strategies and resources. 

Relatively small investments that address the underlying and root causes of gender inequality can bring about a gender dividend, as seen with contributions to the Girl’s Education Policy and SNAP. It is crucial to invest time and resources on gender and adolescent nutrition programming, to strengthen the decision-making capacity of adolescent girls and women, especially on issues related to spending on child care and child care practices. 

Finally, UNICEF needs to take steps to make the resilience agenda actionable and measurable within and across sectors. 

Emerging areas
It is imperative to train and empower young people and youth to be the ‘champions of change’ in society, providing them with opportunities to engage and advocate on issues that are pertinent to them and to shape national and local dialogues and agendas that recognize their potential and needs. Youth-led CSOs and peacebuilding and conflict-prevention interventions at the national and local levels are integral to resilience systems that can contribute to increased social cohesion. UNICEF has developed a youth investment case and will continue to engage with Government and the UN on youth policies and programmes. Young people will be supported to develop their potential and to obtain new knowledge and practical skills for the delivery of WASH services in communities. The reintegration programme for children associated with armed forces or groups serves as an important entry point for youth and adolescent programming.

The public finance for children (PF4C) agenda is nascent, but has been quickly expanding since 2018. UNICEF used the initial entry point of the open budget survey to engage in targeted, high-level advocacy on budget transparency and citizen engagement with MoFEP. The role of trained OBS champions within the Ministry was critical in broadening the scope of the PF4C agenda. In 2019 UNICEF will finalize its first-ever education budget brief, supporting MoGEI with an upcoming public expenditure review and public expenditure tracking survey through the GPE programme, and launching a national capacity-building programme on PF4C. Moreover, UNICEF signed a first-ever multi-year 2019–2021 work-plan with MoFEP, laying the foundation for more strategic and formal engagement in South Sudan’s public finance landscape.

Efforts to support the strengthening of child justice systems were significantly constrained. However, UNICEF has the experience and capacity to expand a small-scale diversion programme designed to build on the strengths of customary restorative justice traditions, and is in a strong position to support justice for children at the national level, in terms of policy, advocacy and upstream work, including complementary support for state- and county-level administrations.

In South Sudan the focus has increasingly shifted from development to humanitarian assistance. In this context, the United Nations provided support for the national dialogue and began work on a combined effort to build resilience and support recovery, particularly in areas where there is sufficient stability to lay the groundwork for durable peace and, ultimately, sustainable development. UNICEF is committed to working jointly with sister agencies to adopt this approach, which is reflected in the United Nations cooperation framework and humanitarian response plan. WASH initiatives in Aweil, Yei, Torit and Yambio aim to improve the health and well-being of women and children – specifically vulnerable groups, epidemic- prone locations, malnourished children and their communities – through the provision of safe water, improved hygiene and sanitation services.

While various activities were undertaken in 2018 in support of the environment, more needs to be done to mitigate climate change and reduce the country office’s carbon dioxide footprint. Key issues to be addressed include: awareness-raising, reducing staff travel and dependence on helicopters for IRRMs, the use of renewable energy and the sustainability of solar-powered infrastructure.

Next steps

The new 2019–2021 country programme continues the transition towards a two-pronged approach of delivering basic lifesaving supplies and services while working in more stable areas for longer-term recovery and resilience of affected communities. Recommendations from the L3 emergency response evaluation and audit of the country programme were used to develop the country programme management plan and the annual management plan for 2019. Key L3 evaluation and audit recommendations included: greater emphasis on preventive approaches; a shift towards more outreach and sustained community engagement; stronger and more mutual partnerships; strengthening the evidence base; enhancements to support programme monitoring and evaluation; a continued push to better integrate and streamline the nutrition, health and WASH responses; and a continued and strengthened supply role.

In 2019 UNICEF will provide life-saving humanitarian assistance in South Sudan through a timely and effective integrated package of nutrition, health, WASH, child protection and education services delivered through interconnected, complementary responses. The response will expand in 2019 to include recovery and resilience programming in selected field locations, including basic social service delivery, community-based system-strengthening and accountability to affected populations. UNICEF will invest in increasing the localization of aid in South Sudan through developing a localization strategy for rolling out tailored capacity-building support to high-potential local CSOs, as part of Grand Bargain commitments. Following the peace deal, UNICEF will also further invest in building the capacity of central and sub-national state authorities. 

UNICEF’s leadership of the nutrition and WASH clusters and the child protection area of responsibility, as well as its co-leadership of the education cluster, will enable strategic planning, coordinated response, capacity building of partners and advocacy, at both the national and state levels. Efforts will be made to ensure that sectors mainstream protection and the ‘do no harm’ principle. Emergency cash programming will be implemented through UNICEF’s strong existing collaborations and inter-agency mechanisms, such as the cash working group.

Looking forward, the revitalized peace agreement has the potential to encourage the formation of static communities, facilitating the expansion of sanitation interventions. As a demand-led sanitation approach, community-led total sanitation can easily lead to socio-economic stimulation in a recovering community. Therefore, development of protocols for handling community-led total sanitation in a post-emergency context will be explored. As identified during the WASH bottleneck analysis, UNICEF will support capacity building among sector stakeholders and the monitoring and evaluation systems of sector agencies, to enable the generation and analysis of data necessary to identify and target the institutional causes of service delivery failures. UNICEF will also place more efforts and resources into reviewing and updating WASH legal frameworks and strengthening the capacity of local structures for sustainable delivery of WASH services.

Decentralization of programme implementation and monitoring functions to field offices will continue to: enhance effectiveness and efficiency in programme delivery, manage programme and operational level risks and further develop counterpart capacity in equity and resilience-based programming. In line with L3 evaluation recommendations, UNICEF will assess the cost effectiveness of field office structures and delivery systems and review the IRRM to institute a rapid deployment mechanism with the required resources. There will be deepened risk assessment for specific activities, in consultation with local communities and relevant stakeholders, to better understand specific bottlenecks and adapt programmes to the unique circumstances of affected communities. Three new field offices will be established: in Abyei, Pibor and Yei. 

Donor funding is declining as South Sudan competes with other global emergencies for support. A key priority is to advocate for and secure sustained funding for programmes such as child protection, nutrition, health and WASH, which continue to face funding challenges. UNICEF will work harder to maintain media coverage of the humanitarian response in light of declining interest.

Creativity, innovation, programme integration and business process improvement will be fostered to increase effectiveness and efficiency in logistics and operational support, building on existing practices while learning from other countries in the region. UNICEF actively participates in the development and refinement of the United Nations business operations strategy, which will serve as a guiding framework to increase and enhance common services, streamline operational practices and reduce duplication. Efforts will be made to strengthen the culture of results to facilitate planning, monitoring, evaluation and reporting on child rights and to ensure a culture of value for money, integrity, accountability and transparency. Finally, UNICEF South Sudan will develop alternative methodologies to attract high-calibre national professional staff to ensure sustainability over time.

ESAR,Uganda,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
UNICEF conducted a midterm review of its 2016–2020 country programme in 2018, to take stock of progress and experience, and to make mid-course corrections to be implemented over the 2019–2020 period. The midterm review concluded that UNICEF’s strategic approaches in Uganda have generally proven to be robust and effective. UNICEF’s promotion of a systems strengthening approach was well reflected in the design, workplans and budgets of all programmes; however, at district level there was still room for improvement when it came to systems strengthening. The review also concluded that the life cycle approach and gender mainstreaming were well adopted and integrated across the country programme. Sound progress was made in building resilience and preparedness to respond to climate-related shocks and stresses in Karamoja; disease outbreak preparedness and control capabilities were enhanced; and the integration of development and emergency assistance in refugee-hosting districts was operationalized, with positive results. Innovative technology for development (T4D) initiatives were up-scaled and UNICEF strengthened the integration and governance of T4D programming within its broader systems strengthening strategy.

The midterm review found that across all UNICEF programme areas, the constraints to progress were similar. These included increasing demands of a rapidly growing population and the impacts of refugee flows and climate change, all within a context of stagnant budget allocations and strained government capacities to plan and deliver essential social services. 

In 2018, UNICEF Uganda identified seven lessons learned, which are summarized below.

1) The quality of the national system is one of the greatest challenges for UNICEF programme delivery. This requires sustained and intensified support to systems and institutional building, especially at district level. While Uganda has a strong policy framework, putting polices and plans into practice is challenging due to weak fiscal management/absorption capacity, inadequate capacities in social norm and behaviour change programming, unharmonized information management, complex coordination structures and low institutional capacity. Given that implementation happens at district level, there is a need to continue strengthening district systems in coordination, capacity building, planning, budgeting and information management. 

 An extensive analysis of child deprivation showed that at least 40 per cent of children with health, HIV, nutrition, and WASH deprivations lived in just 20 districts in the country. Based on those findings, to maximize impact on national level results,UNICEF re-oriented support to districts with the highest number of deprived children (‘bulk’ districts), along with a focus on districts with high rates of deprivation (‘equity’).

In 2018, UNICEF embarked on a new district planning exercise where all Tier 1 districts,which included high burden districts (‘bulk’), as well as highly deprived (‘equity’) and refugee hosting districts, received support for district-level planning and budgeting. The support was aligned with the government budget cycle, to ensure adequate inputs for the FY2019/20. UNICEF was one of the few UN agencies already working directly with district authorities. 

Several constraints were identified in education programming, including  the resource gap for key functions such as collection and analysis of data. The last education statistics were published in 2016. Another challenge wasin early childhood development service delivery, where the high demand for services is not reflected in the national budget. Given the political priority accorded to economic sectors in Uganda, a substantial increase in funding to education is unlikely. In this context, UNICEF is  directing support toward improving efficiency in the use of available resources as well as exploring innovative shared value public-private partnerships.

System strengthening in support of the child protection agenda needs a focused and deliberate approach. While UNICEF support reached 90 districts during the first two years of the country programme, to date none of the districts have a fully functioning protection system in place. Different districts have prioritized different components of the system, depending on whether the interventions are addressing female genital mutilation/cutting, child marriage, refugee children, violence or birth registration. The shift in UNICEF programming for the next two years will be to model the child protection system in eight districts, ensuring all components of the system are in place and consistent across the eight districts, and that the system is addressing key issues such as violence, child marriage, female genital mutilation/cutting and children affected by emergencies. UNICEF will also focus on eight districts over the next two years to generate lessons on what a functioning birth registration system needs to look like.

2) Advocacy for public financing for children needs to be sustained and intensified. There is a need to advocate for a more balanced approach between social and productive investments while also working with government at all levels to make spending of the available resources more efficient. Specific challenges in public finance for children include the poor coordination between national planning and budgeting efforts, and the infrequent collection of disaggregated data for key indicators. UNICEF will continue to work closely with the Uganda Bureau of Statistics and other stakeholders to address those issues. The limited appreciation of the role social protection plays in national development results in low prioritization of funding for child-sensitive social protection. UNICEF will continue to generate evidence and advocate for investments in social protection, while working to strengthen the national social protection system and the implementation of the National Social Protection Policy.

In the area of early childhood education, the political prioritization of primary and secondary education was a challenge. The growing recognition of the importance of early childhood development among technical experts and private sector leadership provides an opportunity for 2019. UNICEF will continue to support the Government in enhancing the coordination mechanisms at the central and district levels to implement the Integrated Early Childhood Development Service Delivery Framework. UNICEF’s partnerships with faith-based organisations will continue to play a critical role in expanding early childhood development services to the children in marginalized communities in 2019.

3) UNICEF has strengthened the humanitarian development nexus but results are challenging to measure. As part of the midterm review, UNICEF conducted a rapid review of its refugee response between 2016 and 2018, to determine whether the country programme is fit for the purpose of humanitarian and development integration. The review found that the UNICEF refugee response in Uganda is a clear example of integration of humanitarian action and development, an approach that is promoted in the UNICEF Strategic Plan 2018–2021. The humanitarian response for children is delivered through traditional humanitarian activities and via development activities in refugee-hosting districts, notably in health, nutrition, WASH, child protection and education. Integration of humanitarian action and development remains difficult to measure through the current monitoring systems because the data is not disaggregated. The midterm review recommended to further strengthen UNICEF support for district-level planning, implementation, coordination and accountability processes that integrate refugee and host community needs, promote the accountability to affected populations approach to build community-local government linkages, and strengthen national and district-level capacities and systems to monitor and report humanitarian responses and to inform planning and local level decision-making. UNICEF strengthened its efforts in district planning in alignment with the Government budgeting cycle. This work will continue in 2019.

4) Integrated approaches to address behaviours and social norms need to be scaled-up.
The midterm review identified room for improvement in communication for development (C4D) and recommended that an office-wide C4D approach be put in place. Four strategic shifts were identified to implement such an approach: results-based work planning, including budgeting; strengthening of government capacity for C4D; strengthening UNICEF C4D capacity; and, a stronger focus on evidence generation, especially related to monitoring and evaluation. In 2018, UNICEF introduced C4D Learning Labs for partners to strengthen C4D programming. C4D was also a key component of Ebola preparedness activities, which UNICEF co-led with the Ministry of Health. In 2019, UNICEF will prioritize six districts for convergence programming to enhance C4D results. UNICEF will help young people become stronger agents of change by improving their communication and social media skills through implementation of the National Multi-Sectoral C4D Strategy for Adolescent Girls.

5) Resource mobilization for the UNICEF country programme should be strengthened.
UNICEF faced resource mobilization challenges, especially in the areas of education, early childhood development, child protection and humanitarian response. UNICEF needs to review the 2016–2020 Resource Mobilization Strategy, with specific recommendations for the underfunded programmes, explore other avenues for leveraging resources for children in Uganda, and further strengthen public-private partnerships to fund programmes for children and adolescents. In addition to the initiative to establish a blended finance facility to reduce multi-dimensional child poverty and train youth to set up and manage early childhood development centres, private sector partnerships could be leveraged to provide pro-poor health services in urban areas, water supply maintenance and production of health commodities, among others.

6) Consensus and partnership building are important. UNICEF experience during 2018 confirmed that collaboration and strategic partnerships are fundamental to improving outcomes for children and women in Uganda. Partnerships in education helped to advance inclusive education, including the provision of assistive devices for children with disabilities. As a member of the Steering Committee established to implement the Education Response Plan for Refugees and Host Communities, UNICEF facilitated funding from Education Cannot Wait. UNICEF also chaired the UN Development Assistance Framework Working Group on Education. 

The importance of building consensus among a wide array of partners to build a common government protection system was evident. While many partners are approaching government on key interventions, further efforts are needed to bring all key players on board. It is difficult for government to keep track of all the different interventions taking place within and across ministries if there is no broad consensus of what the protection system looks like and what roles the different partners should play to strengthen it. Given the limited government resources available for child protection, it is critical that support from development partners be utilized as efficiently and effectively as possible.

The relatively low level of public understanding of child rights and the capacity of key stakeholders involved in child rights and child rights monitoring need to be strengthened. UNICEF will intensify its work with partners such as the Uganda National NGO Forum to strengthen the capacity of civil society to engage more effectively on child rights governance. 

A strategic partnership with the Inter-Religious Council of Uganda, Uganda’s apex body for all faith-based organizations, proved important to accelerating behaviour and social norm change. Strategic partnerships with nine national media agencies were vital to raise awareness on key issues children experience, such as violence, as well as to drive public discussion and engagement for change. A partnership with Private Sector Foundation Uganda, Uganda’s private sector apex body, was valuable in mobilizing the private sector’s influence to invest in children and build Uganda’s future human capital.

7) Programme effectiveness can be strengthened in a number of ways. Following an internal audit and the due diligence assessment conducted by UK DFID, which recommended strengthening harmonized approach to cash transfer processes, UNICEF conducted a business review. That process provided recommendations on further strengthening the documentation and tracking of direct cash transfers to counterparts. 

Uganda continued to identify opportunities for innovations. Existing innovations such as FamilyConnect, Kupaa and Kolibri were prepared for scale-up. In 2018, UNICEF also focused on the internal governance of innovations, aiming to ensure that sustainability aspects were fully embedded in the innovations, with the intent of all innovations ultimately being handed over to government counterparts. One example of this was the integration of FamilyConnect with the Community Health Worker Registry.

The strategic shifts recommended by the UNICEF midterm review had staffing implications that were identified through office-wide skills mapping exercises. The resulting positions were filled in a timely manner. UNICEF also made significant efforts to facilitate staff well-being and team building through an all-staff retreat and continued to invest in making the office building more secure by strengthening security standard compliance.

The National (Health) Supply Chain Assessment exercise undertaken by the Ministry of Health in 2018 with support from the Global Fund and USAID, in which UNICEF participated, provided a valuable platform to coordinate the contributions from partners to supply chain strengthening. The assessment exercise provided technical assistance in specific supply chains where UNICEF played a prominent role (immunization, nutrition), and also set the basis for the development of a national supply chain strategy in 2019/2020. The focus during 2018 was on creating the framework for the nutrition supply chain integration, as well as ensuring that the gains in immunizations supply chain (effective vaccine management, cold chain, supply chain integration with National Medical Stores) were maintained. Significant efforts were made to increase advocacy and provide operational solutions to address supply financing issues, especially for traditional government-funded vaccines. Regular information sharing with other countries in the region that have initiated similar processes (Kenya and Malawi) was ongoing and regional or country visits were being considered as part of the integration pathway.

ESAR,United Rep. of Tanzania,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Constraints

Numerous challenges exist for obtaining sustainable improvements for children. Tanzania is changing rapidly. Several years of strong economic growth have put the country on the brink of achieving middle-income status and poverty is declining. There was progress in a number of human development dimensions. The proportion of stunted children reduced by one third between 1992 and 2015 and there was an impressive decrease in under-five mortality by 40 per cent since 2005.  

Government priorities are fighting corruption; increased government control over the management of natural resources; infrastructure investment; increasing tax revenues; and moving government ministries and agencies to the capital Dodoma. These shifts create challenges to promote initiatives that focus on human capital development. A number of traditional donors of UNICEF’s work in Tanzania are in the process of reviewing their priorities in the country, requiring the country office to diversify partner and donor engagement. Simultaneously, through dedicated technical support and advocacy, UNICEF Tanzania focused on leveraging and influencing resources for children from global funds such as GAVI and GFATM.

With an increase in total budget for social sectors, the specific social-sector budgets remain below international spending benchmarks for education, health and social protection, and have declined as a proportion of the overall budget. The education share of the national budget decreased from 17 per cent in 2015/16 to 15 per cent in 2017/18. For health, the share of the national budget was gradually declining, currently at 7 per cent compared to the international benchmark of 15 per cent; and the 2017/18 budget is less than half the amount required to realize the Health Sector Strategic Plan IV goals.  

The Joint Multi-sectoral Nutrition Review 2018 had similar findings and indicated that average nutrition spending at council level reduced by 65 per cent in the past year. As a result, no region met the minimum budget allocation for nutrition of TZS 1,000 (approximately US$0.40) per child in 2017/18. This poses a challenge for expanding core interventions and will require advocacy in 2019 and beyond. UNICEF will continue to support, and dialogue with, the Government to enhance allocations to social sectors, improve budget execution performance, and enhance transparency of budget information in line with international standards.

At sub-national level, local government authorities have relatively little discretion over spending, including on services for children. Locally-raised revenue is a small portion of the overall budget and is affected by centralization of certain taxes. Transfers from central level mainly cover recurrent and operational charges, while funds for investments are inadequate or not disbursed. Analysis reveals that central-level transfers to local government authorities do not reduce inequities between districts. The allocation formula favors districts already better endowed with health and education infrastructure and staffing. UNICEF supports the Ministry of Finance on several fronts to address these bottlenecks, including social sector budget analysis, a Nutrition Public Expenditure Review and capacity development for child-focused planning and budgeting. In 2019, emphasis will be placed on supporting local government-level budgeting and improving the equity-content of central-level transfers to districts.

Human resource needs in the social sectors (education, health and protection) are growing and are of concern. Additional funding is required for the recruitment of teachers, skilled health personnel and community health workers under their recently-approved scheme. Innovative human resource management approaches are critical to keep up with population growth. UNICEF will support the development of new and stop-gap human resource strategies, such as the use of para-professionals in education, and provide analysis that highlight human resource needs in the medium- to long-term. 

At national level, the percentage of children under five with severe acute malnutrition admitted for treatment slightly decreased from 14 per cent in 2016/17 to 12 per cent in 2018/19 (cure rate > 75 per cent). Progress in severe acute malnutrition treatment coverage is constrained as it lacks a source of sustainable funding, which affects the availability of essential supplies. This is being addressed by UNICEF Tanzania with integration of severe acute malnutrition supplies into the national system, strengthening the Government’s supply chain management, and supporting local government authorities and health facilities to plan for supplies using domestic funds. 

A comprehensive approach is required to address the issue of girls who are pregnant and are out of school. Government pronouncements on preventing these girls from going back to public school complicated the discussion in 2018. While government-informed private schools are exempt from this policy, most girls, including those who become pregnant, often cannot afford the cost of private schooling. The newly developed NAIAA will (if implemented as planned) contribute to preventing school drop-out and provide alternative learning pathways that are inclusive of girls. In addition, there are small-scale initiatives to support the education of girls who are pregnant.  

Amendments to the 2015 Statistics Act have implications for the regulation of information and statistics in Tanzania: they require prior authorization of the National Bureau of Statistics for publishing or communicating official statistics. Prior consultation is now required in cases where findings from published data are different from statistics published by the bureau. While the production of official statistics was already subject to National Bureau of Statistics approval, the amendments expand the governing scope of the Statistics Act from “official statistics” to “statistical information”, requiring further clarification from the Government.

There is need for better evidence-based planning, prioritization, budgeting and monitoring to achieve results for children at local level. THE President’s Office Regional Administration and Local Government offices is strengthening general planning, budgeting and monitoring and evaluation, including support for the PLAN-REP system, used to develop local government plans and budgets, and an improved local government monitoring database. Support for the strengthened use of relevant data for local government planning, budgeting and monitoring and evaluation is a priority for UNICEF in 2019.

In January 2018, the Government decided to withdraw from the implementation of the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework. However, having a joint United Nations programme for host communities close to refugee areas allowed policy-level dialogue to take place. It ensured continued service delivery for refugees and host communities, and enabled the United Nations family to come together in addressing a complex situation.

The planned roll out of the simplified birth registration system in Kigoma and Kagera was postponed. Initially, the Government agreed to roll out the simplified system in the refugee camps as well, but the launch was put on hold. Concerns were raised about the substantial number of people from Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Uganda who reside in these bordering regions without a status, so the Government wanted to complete a national identification exercise in the region. Hence, the Registration Insolvency and Trusteeship Agency decided the new system would instead be rolled out in Dodoma and Singida regions in early 2019. This decision meant that the target of reaching 13 regions with the new system could not be achieved in 2018. 

Lessons learned

UNICEF Tanzania needs to increase investment in ‘upstream’ support at sub-national level in the Southern Highlands and Zanzibar to achieve sustainable progress for children. Implicit in this is the need for UNICEF’s support to be embedded within sectoral and multi-sectoral sub-national development plans. This will require time invested by UNICEF staff with key partners during the local government-level planning, prioritization and budgeting processes. Through a capacity-development strategy, UNICEF Tanzania will support Government officials at different levels to better use data for decision-making, analyze evidence on proven-effective interventions, prioritize interventions, implement and monitor impact. This represents the ‘local upstream’ agenda for the country office. 

UNICEF experience to date on convergent programming for early childhood development and adolescents will be taken to the next level in 2019. For early childhood development, UNICEF Tanzania has substantial operational experience on the ground with good progress as a result of convergent and integrated programming. However, the essential elements of the integrated early childhood development package must be anchored in the government coordination, planning, budgeting, implementation and monitoring mechanisms to ensure implementation at scale in a sustainable manner.  

For adolescent programming, a different approach will be used for the 10–14 and 15–19 age group, as well as for girls and for boys, as a generic approach did not have impact. UNICEF Tanzania will identify entry points and pilot a minimum package of interventions to make a difference for vulnerable adolescent girls and boys in Tanzania. Young people working in the country office, such as United Nations Volunteers, junior programme officers and interns, brought in relevant and valued contributions to the work of UNICEF Tanzania.

It's essential that UNICEF Tanzania monitor and respond to the changes in the political economy environment. The current country programme is implemented in a dynamic political economy environment. The National Five-Year Development Plan (2016–2021),‘Nurturing industrialization for economic transformation and human development,’ focuses on industrialization with a push for investments in infrastructure and job creation, and for development partners to contribute to results. In this changing political environment, UNICEF work for children’s rights must speak to the prominent priorities of the Government. The importance of investing in the early years, quality education, girl’s education, adolescent development and well-being for human capital development and economic growth needs to be emphasized regularly. This means equipping staff with the necessary knowledge, skills and tools to be able to make the necessary arguments for investing in children, and being flexible in adjusting programme strategy and emphasis depending on the contextual issues. 

Being agile and seizing opportunities that emerged in 2018 enabled UNICEF to provide leadership in different areas. During the year, the Ministry of Health expressed its intention to create a national ‘accelerated action and investment agenda for adolescent health and wellbeing’, covering the holistic needs of adolescents. UNICEF Tanzania was able to respond to this request swiftly with multisector expertise, shaping the agenda by providing technical assistance and by catalyzing the participation of adolescents and young people in the process.  

UNICEF Tanzania also responded to the Generation Unlimited partnership agenda by leveraging existing work with adolescents and young people (such as on ‘human-centered design’ with students from the Youth for Children Innovation Hub at the University of Dar es Salaam). During 2019, more than 10 young Tanzanians joined the office as national UN Volunteers and interns, including the youth voice and influence in UNICEF programming and bringing youthful energy into the day-to-day UNICEF country office environment. 

Moving forward

UNICEF Tanzania identified a number of strategic shifts in 2018 during the mid-term review which will be implemented in 2019 and beyond. The mid-term review process confirmed the overall direction and objectives of the country programme. Based on lessons learned and changes in context, all programme strategy notes were updated, including theories of change, and there were minor adjustments in results frameworks.  

The country programme will continue to be implemented during a period of infrastructure development and economic growth, while the country still struggles with overall poverty and child poverty. UNICEF Tanzania will make required adjustments, such asa focus on sustainability, scale, institutionalization and leveraging of domestic resources.  

Three overarching shifts for the country programme include: 1) some programme areas will quickly phase-out working at small-scale, and transition to influencing budgets and action at scale; 2) capacity in the field offices in Mbeya (responsible for the Mbeya, Iringa, Njombe and Songwe Regions), Kibondo, Zanzibar and the United Nations joint office in Dodoma will be enhanced for a stronger influence at local level to deliver results for children; and 3) integrated programming for adolescents and institutional, holistic approaches for early childhood development need to be accelerated. The mid-term review process was participatory, with staff involved through various fora which included the ‘speak up committee’, the participation of the staff association, and the representation of both national and international staff on the mid-term review committee.

UNICEF Tanzania will prioritize child-focused interventions which are scalable, informed by evidence and sustainable. There will be emphasis on addressing the barriers and enablers for scale and sustainability. In this regard, the work on public finance for children, partnerships, local-level institutional strengthening, leveraging domestic resources and exploring innovative financing will become prominent across the programme. UNICEF will expand its role in strengthening government supply systems (especially for nutrition and immunization supplies) through strengthening the supply chain workforce and functions.

From a management perspective, there will be focus on supporting the field offices to deliver on equity-oriented decentralization and local governance for children. The new UNICEF presence in Dodoma will facilitate interactions with Government in planning, prioritization discussions and monitoring. The innovations agenda in UNICEF Tanzania is expected to grow, with the ground testing of innovative ideas from young people, the expansion of U-Report both in Mainland and Zanzibar, and outreach to engage institutions to act as Y4C Innovation Hubs. UNICEF Tanzania remains vigilant in anticipating and addressing disease outbreaks and responding to the refugee situation.

UNICEF Tanzania will continue to build the capacity, skills and attitude of staff around important topics such as ethics, the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse, gender equality, environmental awareness and greening, by continuing practical and hands-on office-wide training approaches started in 2018. These capacity-building efforts were led and facilitated by UNICEF Tanzania staff, and have helped staff to take concrete actions at both personal and professional levels. As a result, UNICEF Tanzania eliminated single-use plastics in all its offices and established systems to recycle. UNICEF Tanzania will continue gender-related conversations as a forum for staff to discuss and devise practical solutions around gender issues experienced by staff members at work and at home. 

As a ‘Delivering as One’ country and with the new UNDS reforms taking place in 2019, UNICEF Tanzania will continue to play an active role in the United Nations family. UNICEF Tanzania will deliver on its commitments on two United Nations joint programmes and seek further opportunities for United Nations joint advocacy, and providing analytical and policy support to the Government of United Republic of Tanzania. UNICEF Tanzania will further engage in supporting the United Nations-wide business operations strategy and innovations to deliver results more efficiently.

"
ESAR,Zambia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
The results described in Part 2 were achieved through the use ofmultiple several strategies, including: institutional strengthening of national systems, social/behavioural change communication and community engagement, policy engagement, service delivery, south-south cooperation, planning and monitoring, advocacy and public engagement, public and private partnerships, working together with other UN agencies, innovation, data analysis, research and evaluation, and operational support to programme delivery.  

These strategies are linked to the theory of change for the country programme and had varying degrees of effectiveness in the Zambian programming environment. Several challenges were experienced during the implementation of the programme and several lessons which have influenced the choice of strategies and approaches for 2019 and beyond. In 2018, UNICEF Zambia conducted a Mid-Term Review of the 2016-2021 country programme, and this  highly participatory process also provided numerous lessons learned and shaped the direction that the office will take for the remainder of the country programme. 

The main strategy that the country programme has used to achieve results for children is institutional strengthening of national systems. Around 65 per cent of UNICEF Zambia’s financial resources were directed to this strategy, although its implementation and potential impact were affected by reduced funding across sectors. UNICEF will need to continue to seek opportunities to expand partnerships to mobilize and leverage resources for social sectors from development partners and from the national budget. In addition, were challenges with some donors, who have raised concerns about the Government’s financial management systems, and this led to withdrawal of funding and changes in funding modalities for some programmes implemented by UNICEF. 

Programmes directly affected include the UN Joint Programme on Social Protection, the UN Joint Programme on Health Systems Strengthening (RMNCHA-N) and Social Accountability, and the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) interim fund manager phase. The Government instituted forensic audits for the MCDSS and MoGE, which affected implementation as a significant number of staff involved in UNICEF-supported programmes were put on forced leave, pending investigations. 

A clear lesson from this prevailing donor relations environment is the need for increased support and capacity in public financial management. In addition to the challenges raised at national level, subnational government partners use separate financial management systems for government and UNICEF funds. This increases the risk of delay in reporting on fund utilization and requests for subsequent disbursements, increased transactional costs and reduced donor confidence. UNICEF Zambia will continue to engage with the Government on improved financial and accounting practices. 

A further lesson learned from systems strengthening strategies is that results are sustainable when the Government is leading and sets aside resources to support programmes. Slow disbursements of national budget funds in 2018 to social sectors affected the pace and scale of programme implementation. In addition to disbursement challenges, the constrained fiscal space due to a slow-down in economic growth and increased debt repayments this year led to lower investments in the social services sector. 

Generally, there were delays in the release of funds by the Ministry of Finance on account of increased debt servicing costs. This led to delayed implementation of country programme activities as well as heightened risks of misapplication of UNICEF resources, given that the Government is currently spending about 78 per cent of its budget on salaries and debt costs. For example, only 27 per cent was released for the social cash transfer programme by mid-2018, with 52 per cent projected for end of the year. Additionally, the MoGE reported that as of end September 2018, only 49 per cent of funds for non-staff-related programmes had been released by Ministry of Finance. UNICEF Zambia will continue with advocacy for the timely release of allocated funds in the national budget.  

Related to public financing for children, UNICEF is supporting several initiatives that raise the profile and centrality of increased resources to social sectors that benefit children. UNICEF continued to support the Government and other national partners in building on good practices and accelerating action, conducting national and sub-national budget analysis, engaging in public dialogue, providing public financial management support, and advocating for both public and private resource investment in children. Another lesson emanating from UNICEF’s support towards systems strengthening was the value of the technical expertise the organization provides to shape the agenda for children’s rights and ensure the prioritization of results for children. By offering technical leadership in development of National Plan for Elimination of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV and Syphilis, National Operational Plans for Adolescent Health Strategy, and the National AIDS Strategic Framework, UNICEF Zambia positioned itself well to highlight key issues, such as strengthening leadership and governance for adolescent health, age and sex disaggregation and cohort monitoring in PMTCT.

Multisectoral coordination remained a challenge, often leading to fragmented implementation. This reduced the potential impact from a coordinated response for the country programme in 2018. However, UNICEF’s role in multisectoral coordination for various sectors, for example ECD, was strong. With a high level of trust from the Government and long history in the country, UNICEF is well regarded as a lead agency in various sectors. This favourable position can be further strengthened and leveraged for more integrated national policy development, data strengthening, and systems strengthening.

While labour-intensive and highly demanding, UNICEF’s role in sector coordination continued to be found highly important and strategic. Regarded as an impartial and credible voice, UNICEF is well-positioned to facilitate consultation and participation of partners. The post Mid-Term Review agreement for integrated programming in ECD, nutrition and adolescence – in line with the 7NDP – can serve as test cases for planning, budgeting, coordination and implementation. 

Some sectors continued to lack the enabling environment to facilitate programme implementation and coordination. Where policies, plans and strategies exist, there are often challenges with implementation, largely due to a lack of resources. UNICEF Zambia will continue to provide technical support for the development of policies, strategies and guidelines that are in line with international norms and advocate strongly for their implementation.

Systems strengthening and service delivery require a stable workforce in order to deliver the desired results. There were frequent staff changes in 2018 at both the central and subnational levels, leading to delays in implementation, increased transactional costs of programmes, and delays in reporting on programme implementation. Many sectors remainhampered by a shortage of qualified professionals. For example, an inadequate number of social workers in the MCDSS and prioritization of their role in the delivery and expansion of the SCT programme, coupled with a lack of coordination and clarity on the role and responsibilities of social workers in other ministries and departments, highlights the limited capacity of the state to respond adequately to cases of violence, abuse and the neglect of children. The reliance on volunteers is positive in many ways, but also raises issues of reliability and accountability. Through capacity development, technical support and targeted service delivery, UNICEF will support the Government to improve the quality of services at all levels. 

UNICEF Zambia continued to support Government and other partners to generate evidence for informed advocacy and programming. However, availability of disaggregated data remained a challenge in 2018 and impacted the ability to measure performance. UNICEF Zambia is committed to supporting the Government to develop sectoral management information systems for improved generation and use of timely and accurate data for decision-making, including with appropriate disaggregation. Data availability will further enhance sector planning and service provision. UNICEF will also leverage resources and support from other development partners for improved evidence generation and use this to drive change for children. UNICEF will pursue a learning approach for the implementation of the integrated programmes and ensure that theyare accompanied by an evidence generation agenda.

A number of UNICEF-supported initiatives have not had a strong element of demand creation, which has at times been ad hoc and unsystematic. Low levels of community engagement for social accountability hamper the ability of rights-holders to demand quality services. UNICEF will utilize communication for development approaches and work with community leaders and traditional chiefs to promote behavioural change and social accountability.

The cholera outbreak in 2017-2018 provided lessons for more proactive and risk-informed programme planning. The delivery of education services to school-going children was delayed as schools remained closed following a government directive at the peak of the cholera epidemic. UNICEF and partners have agreed to plan well ahead of the next rainy season to ensure smooth programme implementation and mitigate bottlenecks and risks going forward. This has demonstrated a strong need to strengthen the integration of risk reduction and emergency preparedness andresponse into regular developmental programming. The refugee response in the Mantapala settlement, particularly construction-related activities (including WASH), experienced major delays due to poor accessibility during the rainy season. There were issues related to the high groundwater table. This calls for careful site selection of the refugee settlements with due consideration to the accessibility and assessment of ground water conditions. This also affected the rate at which refugees were moved from the transit centre in Kenani to the designated settlement. Development partner investments for the transit centre were reduced as the focus shifted to investments at the settlement. Another lesson learned relates to the need to systematically create space for affected people to voice their distinct needs and use feedback to inform design and provision of services and take corrective measures.

A further constraint on programming in 2018 was its geographical spread, particularly with regard to service delivery. The population density (23 people per square kilometre), compounds this, making it challenging and expensive to provide and monitor services, particularly in rural areas. UNICEF Zambia will undertake an analysis of its geographic spread and propose a more rational approach.

Through the Mid-Term Review and Mid-Term Management Review processes conducted in 2018 jointly with Government and UN partners, the strategic direction of the country programme was aligned with the 7NDP. The review process reaffirmed a commitment to a child-centred, integrated, multisectoral approach in the areas of early childhood development, programming for adolescent girls and boys, and multisectoral nutrition programming. All staff participated actively in the Mid-Term Review exercise, through consultative meetings at key stages, and as members of discussion groups on thematic papers. Clear steps were established for the management review process to ensure transparency and genuine participation of staff in the proposals for change. In follow-up, UNICEF Zambia focussed on the necessary procedures to support staff through the change process. The review process resulted in structural changes, including the creation of 22 posts, offset by 21 abolished posts (of which 11 were vacant), representing a net increase of one post. 

The office maintained a strong focus on human resources and staff well-being throughout the year, notably through staff retreats and team-building efforts in follow up to the global staff survey. UNICEF led the development of a revised Business Operations Strategy (BOS) for the United Nations Working Together in Zambia, which covers the period 2018-2021. The new approach to implementing the BOS includes Common Working Groups for each of the areas of operations that are comprised of staff from across agencies. Results matrices and annual workplans were developed to guide Working Groups activities. Challenges remain, however, in both motivating enough attention to the common activities and in measuring impact across multiple different resource planning systems.

A number of challenges noted required significant management attention during the year. Priorities for 2019 include ensuring that the office has improved systems for oversight, monitoring, reporting and responding to similar issues should they arise. Specifically, 2019 priorities include: financial risk management, value for money and programme monitoring; resource mobilisation and partnership management; staff wellbeing and inclusion, and;emergency preparedness. Building on the support and guidance already received from the UNICEF Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Office effective systems will be established for managing fraud reporting and response, as well as for prevention, reporting and response to sexual exploitation and abuse.

Lessons learned 

Winning support for the cause of children from decision-makers through national budget advocacy 
In 2018, UNICEF’s budget advocacy through joint efforts between UNICEF sections and partners and close engagement in the 2018 pre- and post-budget discussions with ministries was an opportunity for accelerating better results for children. Key lessons learned in the budget advocacy work included the need to be grounded in evidence and right targeting; engaging with the right audience and with the most effective messages. UNICEF’s theory of change is to generate evidence to inform programming. Evidence from the annual budget analysis of primary and secondary education showed that the sector was significantly underfunded, with over 98 per cent of the expenditures going to salaries, with little on other key aspects of learning- teaching and infrastructure, thereby negatively affecting outcomes for children. In response, and informed by research into possible sustainable financing options for education, UNICEF recommended through the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Education, the Government levy 5 per cent tax on Third Party Motor Vehicle insurance to mobilize funding for investment in education. These proposals were presented to the Minister of Finance during the pre-budget consultations, who adopted the idea in the 2019 Budget, albeit for financing health through the Road Accident Fund. This proposal will significantly contribute towards increasing fiscal space for health, which has over the years relied on development partner support.

Going forward, UNICEF will work with Parliament and civil society to advocate for transparency and accountability in the use of funding generated from the proposal, to achieve accelerated results in health. In addition, UNICEF will continue to undertake research on options for expanding fiscal space for sustained investments in social sectors benefiting children. While the previous research had focused on health and education, other equally important areas such as WASH, child andsocial protection, and nutrition will be prioritized.

Cross sectoral collaboration to ensure every child lives in a safe and clean environment 
Climate and environment programming in UNICEF Zimbabwe are mainstreamed and are cross-cutting themes that seek to contribute to Goal Area 4 of ensuring every child lives in a safe and clean environment. To achieve this, the theory of change entails working across sections using the integrated approach to achieve the overall goal of a clean environment under UNICEF Zimbabwe’s theme - “For every child, sustainable energy”. This thematic approach helps to streamline efforts and is a good entry point for all programmes to set targets and integrate climate, environment and energy (CEE) into their workplans. 

In piloting the “For every child, sustainable energy” theme, cross-sectoral collaboration resulted in the mobilization of US$3million for the project on Sustainable Energy for Health Facilities and Surrounding Communities (SE4HF) from Sweden. Resource mobilization is a critical first step towards rolling out of the project, which is a collaborative effort by Social Policy, WASH, Health and Nutrition Sections, that seeks to support the mainstreaming of CEE in UNICEF programmes whilst complementing and delivering on Health Development Fund targets for maternal and newborn health. The key lesson learned is that joint efforts and stronger collaboration across sections can help deliver better results, by leveraging on their respective expertise and experience, and that donors are more willing to support programmeswhich are multi-faceted.

In 2019, the focus will be on programme implementation, drawing on the expertise of sections and partners in Government and civil society. Successful implementation of this phase of the project can be a stepping stone towards resource mobilization to scale up the project country-wide. The pursuit of mainstreaming CEE, greening the office, working for more child-inclusive climate change policies and implementation of the National Development Committee as well as delivering on targets in the sustainable energy project will remain important. Working together in a collaborative manner between sections, as well as between programme and operations will be crucial to reach success. In addition, the theory of change will need to be further strengthened to add more value to key programmatic work across sections.

Using community engagement and innovation to improve service delivery in the WASH sector 
UNICEF Zimbabwe’s WASH programme aims to support Government to improve and monitor equitable use of safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene practices. The Government, with support from UNICEF, invested in the Rural WASH Information Management System (RWIMS). This is a near-real-time monitoring system that aims to improve data reliability, equity analysis and use of technological innovations in regular WASH programming and to support emergency preparedness and response.  

With RWIMS, two important limitations were identified. The first was a lack of consistent communication between key informants (data sources) and enumerator (data conveyors to national Geodatabase; and the second was the absence of notifications and feedback to communities resulting in inaction by responsible authorities on issues raised. To address these shortcomings, UNICEF supported integration of RWIMS with RapidPro, known as SMS Notification and Response System (RWIMS SNR) and this was piloted in one district. Positive results were found, as RapidPro enabled communities (key informants) to communicate with government extension workers (enumerators) and was used to send alerts to duty bearers, such as village pump mechanics, to address issues reported by the communities. Due to the utilization of the RWIMS SNR, two-thirds of the SMS notifications sent from the community during the pilot resulted in a village pump mechanic visiting the site and this resulted in 56 per cent of the problematic water points becoming functional. The intervention’s theory of change was carefully mapped prior to commencing the work and was based around capacity building, community engagement and innovation all combining to reduce pump repair time. The system was successfully established in all seven rural districts of Manicaland Province (around 400,000 households) with 15,000 informants registered and will be further scaled-up in 2019.  

Lessons learned include that modern technology can be effective in enhancing community engagement and linkages with duty bearers to deliver better results for women and children. Furthermore, it was learned that all levels of Government need to be fully involved with the process roll-out and that mobile network operators need to be engaged very early on in the process to iron out access issues. The principles of start small, learn and then scale-up worked well, as did the office collaboration between WASH, Communication and ICT. Ongoing economic challenges in Zimbabwe constrained progress but it is aimed to reach at least two more provinces with RWIMSSNR in 2019.

Working together as the UN to deliver better results for women and children 
Within the context of UN reform, UNICEF, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP) commenced strategic and technical convergence in 2017 through a common results framework for stunting reduction. To ensure a more coordinated approach and mutual understanding of the strategic direction, in 2018 a UN inventory was carried out to comprehensively map the nutrition-related interventions in Zimbabwe of these three agencies, along with the World Health Organization. The inventory provided useful insight into the UN’s engagement in nutrition. While there was good alignment of the UN agencies within the national food and nutrition security plan, there was an over-emphasis on supporting implementation of nutrition-sensitive and specific activities. There was not enough focus on building an enabling environment, such as supporting subnational level multi-sector action plans, advocacy, policy work and budgeting. In 2019 the four UN agencies will prioritize these areas, exploring the possibility of joint programmes. 

Main challenge faced in 2018 

Currency devaluation, cash shortages and lack of access to foreign currency impacted negatively on UNICEF programmes, as highlighted in Part 1 of this annual report. To minimize the impact of this situation, UNICEFsupported implementing partners to open Nostro foreign currency accounts to be able to access US dollars. However, a challenge remained with the high charges for transactions in these accounts. In addition, while some service providers did not open the foreign currency accounts and continued to charge RTG prices. Furthermore, some service providers, particularly the retail sector, increased prices of goods and services but did not differentiate between US dollar payments and RTGs, which negatively impacted on purchases made in dollars. 

The loss of value of the local currency resulted in demotivation, poor retention and turnover of government staff across all sectors, including education, health, and social services. The situation worsened in the health sectorwith junior doctors on strike. In education teachers have threatened to go on strike and in the social services many experienced social workers have continued being recruited in the international community. This has resulted in poor service delivery to women and children in Zimbabwe. 

Furthermore, the country experienced a humanitarian crisis triggered by a serious cholera outbreak in September 2018, the biggest in a decade in Zimbabwe. As of 31 December,, MoHCC reported 10,630 cholera cases (10,338 suspected and 292 confirmed cases) and 65 deaths throughout the country. Similarly, typhoid cases continued to be reported throughout the year, and by on 18 December, a cumulative yearly total of 7,134 typhoid cases and 25 deaths had been reported nationally.

Lessons learned

Focus on results and theory of change: influencing national policy making and scaling up innovative models
The programme theory of change maintained a policy-oriented approach with a decentralized component to ensure concrete contribution to equity results while offering programme models for further nationwide replication and eventually adoption in national policies. 

The core of programme results at national level were related to supporting the Government’s reform and planning processes particularly on quality of secondary education, juvenile justice, adolescents’ health and social protection. Findings from UNICEF-supported evidence generation and studies informed the Universal Child Allowance's reform plan and the debate on the role of conditions. A notable result was the work to extend the coverage of Argentina’s Universal Child Allowance to enrol excluded children. In Salta Chaco and Tucuman Provinces UNICEF assisted in identifying and including more than 17,643 children. 

Another relevant contribution at legislative and policy level was the support provided to the juvenile justice reform through high quality international expertise, and to law reform to improve access to justice in cases of sexual abuse. Additionally, technical assistance was provided for the design and implementation of Argentina’s first National Plan to Prevent Adolescent Unintended Pregnancy and to the National Plan to Prevent Obesity.

UNICEF also directed efforts towards addressing inequalities in 14 of the 24 Argentina’s provinces, designing and implementing replicable models to strengthen supply and demand of quality services. Some of UNICEF flagships model interventions that have become public policy included: provision of information and communication technology-based secondary education to young people in isolated rural communities; expansion of gender-responsive health services to prevent adolescent pregnancies and suicide; development of a model to expand coverage of cash transfer programmes in remote rural areas through active search operations and; scale-up of case management information systems for child protection services.

Inter-sectoral approach: focus on ECD, adolescents and gender programming
Intensive inter-sectoral work in ECD, at national and international level was promoted during 2018. In the international arena, UNICEF Argentina strongly advocated for the inclusion of ECD at the G20 Summit. As a result of UNICEF’s global, regional and national advocacy, the final G20 communique included a declaration on the issue for the first time ever. At a national level UNICEF continued strengthening the Early Childhood Plan and provincial policies and contributed to develop a comprehensive ECD National Strategy. 

A specific gender equality focus was included in ECD through the “Diamond Model”, to advocate changing social norms and generating new family leave legislation with high private sector engagement. A draft bill was presented to extend paternity leave and discussion in Parliament is expected to take place in 2019. The gender equality focus was also reinforced through UNICEF’s efforts to prevent adolescent unintended pregnancy, support integral sexual education, and prevention of violence and sexual abuse, all linked to the UN and European Union Spotlight Initiative. 

UNICEF Argentina placed adolescents at the centre of the country programme 2016-2020. Several strategies were utilized to promote public policies and services for adolescents with a holistic approach: generating evidence and public advocacy, developing innovative models and promoting the participation of adolescents. Launched in 2017, UNICEF’s public position on adolescents was a key milestone to boost the intersectoral work, that was reinforced in 2018 with the communication campaign #Yovielfuturo.

Knowledge generation included technical guidelines and a baseline study on adolescent health’s advisory services at national level, upcoming research on adolescent suicide, study cases on secondary education reform at provincial level, compilation of good practices in ISE and focused studies on juvenile justice.

Advocacy continued in the areas of juvenile justice, with the promotion of a national law in line with international standards, and inhealth with multiple initiatives to prevent adolescents’ pregnancy. The promotion of quality and inclusive education, support to secondary education reform, and implementation of the first law in the region to guarantee rights for children without parental care transitioning to adult were also important policy results.

At provincial level, UNICEF was active in designing and implementing replicable models to improve adolescents’ service provision and demand. These involved a range of critical issues including: adolescent pregnancy; suicide and obesity prevention through health advisory services; preventing school drop-out and improving learning outcomes in secondary education; promoting the autonomy of adolescents and their transition to independent life thorough labour insertion opportunities, and; the opening of alternative services for adolescents in conflict with the law.

UNICEF continued placing adolescent’s digital citizenship on the public agenda as a key element to promote their right to communication and active participation. Around 465,000 adolescents committed themselves to social change through innovative experiences, such as the digital coexistence programme, global initiatives like U-Report, a partnership with Facebook, and engagement initiatives like “It’s not cool to share”. UNICEF positioned itself as a reference in this field, generating information for the media and the public on adolescents’ use of the internet and social networks, and providing evidence for decision makers and social leaders to inform public policies. 

Partnership engagement
Partnership development remained an important function of UNICEF Argentina given its dual programme and fundraising nature. UNICEF deepened its integration of private sector engagement with programmatic priorities. Alliances were strengthened with the private sector (30 active relationships) to maximize their full potential to accelerate results for children in key areas of secondary education, digital citizenship, CED and healthy nutrition.. In the latter two, concrete results were achieved for children: a draft national regulation on product labelling and large companies’ modification of internal regulation on parental leave. 

Partnerships with other stakeholders such as civil society, professional networks and academia were also strengthened during 2018. Ongoing partnerships with national, provincial governments and a total of 48 NGOs and four universities contributed to programmatic results in 14 provinces, including institutional relations with Supreme Courts of Justice in five provinces. UNICEF supported the national child-rights-network of judges, the national network of ombudspersons, and the network of journalists committed to children’s rights, which act as a critical mass to support UNICEF advocacy.

UNICEF Argentina continued being an active member of the UN Country Team during 2018, chairing the social protection resultsgroup, closely cooperating with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), ILO, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and UN WOMEN in the development of the Spotlight Initiative, with PAHO on obesity prevention, and with the ILO on developing specific studies on child labour.

Argentina business modality
UNICEF Argentina continued to have an innovative office profile with a dual and integrated nature of programme and fundraising, supported by an advanced communication and partnership-building function. The success of this approach was reflected in UNICEF Argentina’s capacity to widen its partnership base beyond traditional Government allies and civil society, embracing a growing number of media outlets, influencers, and individual and corporate donors. 

In line with the organization’s global cause framework, an approach that has strongly inspired and influenced the work locally, UNICEF Argentina plans to ensure a systematic search for integration to widen its audience for advocacy, social mobilization and fundraising purposes. 

With a loyalty base of 300,000 individuals and large group of private sector partners, the investment in connecting high impact programme results to fundraising strategies will continue throughout the country programme. An example is provided by the ten-hour long telethon “Un sol para los Chicos”, as well as marathons and other massive events, where programme priorities are embedded in a fundraising and communication strategy, packaged to reach nationwide audience. 

Private fundraising and partnership continued to be embedded within all programme components, thus contributing to mobilizing and engaging private partners towards children’s rights through a systematic implementation of the Child Rights in Business Principles. This included, for example, generating dialogue with the food and beverage industry to tackle obesity, involving telecommunication and information technology players to develop internet-based secondary education and partnering with private companies to advocate for ECD policies. 

Contributions to UNICEF globally
Beyond its strive to accomplish the planned country programme  results, UNICEF Argentina actively participated in global initiatives such as the PFP Think Thank, Supporter Engagement Group, Private Sector Engagement Group or Digital First Initiative. It also contributed to global reflections and strategies design on complex emerging issues such as obesity, child and adolescent suicide, digital citizenship and adolescent pregnancy. UNICEF Argentina also boosted South-South cooperation, including social investmentwithArmenia and newborn health with Paraguay.

In 2018, Argentina contributed to UNICEF globally through sharing innovative approaches with 21 short or medium-term missions or stretch assignments. Specifically, these were in the areas of second decade programming, adolescent health, social policy, newborn health, private sector engagement, resource mobilization strategies, special events digital strategies, results-based management, operations, and emergencies. 

Looking forward
UNICEF Argentina will continue improving its business modality, based on a dynamic and synergic integration between its programme, fundraising and communication components. The previous experience and the external operating environment offer tremendous opportunity to materialize the spirit and the content of the global Strategic Plan 2018-2021, particularly its call for a whole UNICEF approach vision.

The expansion of adolescent’s services and a greater emphasis on the second decade of life will continue as the flagship theme for programme convergence, with a focus on the most disadvantaged and the “no child left behind” imperative. The programme will keep a policy-oriented approach yet with a marked decentralized component to ensure concrete contribution to equity results while offering programme models for further nationwide replication.

The launch of Generation Unlimited and the selection of the ICT school model as one of the Generation Unlimited solution provided UNICEF Argentina further opportunity to position the adolescent agenda into public debate. The initiative will be expanded to other provinces while other practical solutions implemented in Argentina could be also improved, nurtured and scaled up in the future. These include: adolescent health advisories services linked with secondary-age education; along with adolescent participation in defining health services, and promoting digital citizenship, both linked with adolescent empowerment. Pending topics to advance the second decade agenda will have to be further discussed in the upcoming country programme, such as skills for learning, employability, and decent work, areas where UNICEF Argentina is ready to engage. 

UNICEF Argentina expects to continue contributing to the implementation of the agency’s work globally with private sector engagement to accelerate commitments for children in the SDGs by 2030. The efforts will be directed towards prominent equity-related child and adolescent issues as well as new emerging themes that require political attention and policy developments, such as obesity prevention or ECD policies. 

The development of a new country programme, to be presented in 2021, will provide UNICEF Argentina with a significant opportunity to rethink and refine programme theories of change, incorporate innovative approaches, and review the structure needed to achieve planned results. The successful operation of PFP and its modus operandi will have to be addressed, in collaboration with UNICEF Headquarters and Regional Office, given the ever-increasing proportion of resources that the UNICEF Argentina is raising beyond the needs of the country programme, through the immense generosity of donors from within the country.

LACR,Barbados,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
The Eastern Caribbean continues to be susceptible to natural hazards; one of UNICEF’s key contributions in the aftermath of disasters is support for the provision of psychosocial programming to children aged 5-12 years. 

One of the key lessons learned during a review after the 2017 hurricanes, held in 2018 jointly with stakeholders from the child protection and education sectors, was that the scope, target group and lead agency for psychosocial programming need to be re-examined. Traditionally the national lead agency for the provision of psychosocial programming is the social development sector. However, it emerged that the education sector, because of its natural link with children, was better positioned to implement Return to Happiness programming to a wider cross-section of affected children. Further, participants found that it was critical for those implementing Return to Happiness to have access to mental health/psychosocial support, as they too will have been affected by the emergency. 

In this regard, in 2019 UNICEF will continue to ensure that Caribbean countries have strengthened capacity to deliver mental health and psycho-social support services in the event of natural or man-made disasters. It will support the training of all teachers across the 12 countries under its multi-country programme in RTH methodology. Further, it will partner with the UWI, CDEMA and sister UN agencies to develop a mental health and psychosocial support training and coordination package to be rolled out across the Caribbean sub-region. 

A second lesson learned was that an adequate response to the migrant crisis in Trinidad and Tobago required overcoming several bottlenecks and data gaps. One bottleneck concerned the lack of holistic understanding of the migrant population residing in Trinidad and Tobago. This information gap impacted negatively on UNICEF ECA’s ability to implement evidence-based programming for the migrant population. Another bottleneck concerned current national legislation, which does not allow migrant and refugee children to attend public schools. 

As it continues to respond to the migrant crisis in 2019, UNICEF ECA will keep advocating for the conducting of a displacement tracking matrix survey. Advocacy with relevant authorities to fill the gap in legislation on refugees and migrants will also be pursued, in collaboration with UNHCR and the UN Resident Coordinator. However, in the interim, UNICEF will collaborate with the Notesmaster global learning programme to provide a blended online education programme that follows the Caribbean Examination Council syllabus, so that migrant children will be able to access quality and certified education. Furthermore, UNICEF will strengthen the capacity of human resources in Trinidad and Tobago to better respond to migrant and refugee children’s programming in education, child protection and C4D. Two international UN volunteers were under recruitment in late 2018: a senior humanitarian coordinator and an education specialist. 

Recognizing that other countries under the UNICEF ECA multi-country programme that have issues concerning migrant children, UNICEF ECA will take the lead in advocating for inter-agency dialogue to support a communication campaign on xenophobia and discrimination against migrant and refugee children. 

The third lesson learned concerns data. The Eastern Caribbean sub-region is data-poor. During 2018 UNICEF ECA invested in data generation and capacity development, in partnership with the OECS, ECLAC and the Caribbean Development Bank, as well as with countries and territories. SDG fact sheets and similar products on young people were produced. However, filling the needs of most countries and territories in regard to data gaps requires an interagency approach under the leadership of the UN Resident Coordinator. The UNICEF ECA Representative will be advocating for a unified United Nations approach on SDG engagement, including capacity development and data generation with countries and territories.

LACR,Belize,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
The Theories of Change and corresponding results logic in the Country Programme Document’s outcome results framework remain relevant.  

To better include the priority needs of Belize’s second decade, in accordance with the findings of the situation analysis, and in line with the Government’s request and UNICEF’s new strategic plan and organizational priorities (including Generation Unlimited), UNICEF Belize supported the main partners in the formulation of a more specific theory of change (ToC) on adolescent health, with a focus on mental health to address a significant and neglected threat to the wellbeing and development of adolescents in Belize. The ToC development for mental health, the country’s first, was being finalized by the Ministry of Health. Because mental health is affected by multiple health, social and environmental determinants and has a wide range of individual, social and economic effects, the ToC will guide multisectoral response to adolescent mental health issues in Belize.  

Adolescent mental health is an area of learning for UNICEF Belize as well as for the Government and partners. UNICEF Belize worked closely with health teams in the UNICEF Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office and at UNICEF Headquarters for guidance and additional capacity. A major lesson learned is  the important added value provided by systematically ensuring that in-country trainings provided to UNICEF staff (particularly on learning agendas), and supported by UNICEF Regional Office and Headquarters, are jointly delivered to key government, civil society and UN agency partners. In 2018, this was the case for results-based management, communication for development (C4D) and intensive emergency-preparedness trainings. This joint delivery strengthened national capacities and enabled more rapid consensus-building on strategies to better deliver for children. As a result of the results-based management training, in addition to the theory of change on mental health, specific theories of change also were developed jointly on early childhood development and juvenile justice. 

Programming at-scale results
UNICEF continued to promote and strengthen intersectoral approaches across all programme areas. This was especially effective in ensuring that children’s needs in Belize are addressed in a holistic and more sustainable manner. For example, quality assurance for early childhood development is managed entirely through an intersectoral technical working group (TWG), which enabled accelerated support toward strengthening of cross-sectoral early childhood development data systems and expansion of capacity building for the rollout of care for childhood development. The successes resulting from this collaboration enabled Belize to consolidate national gains and lessons learned which the Government will share as examples of best practice with other Caribbean countries in a South-South exchange in 2019. Another example of an intersectoral approach that accelerated results for children was the multisectoral WASH Technical Working Group, which oversaw and released findings from Belize’s first study on menstrual hygiene management.

To address the increasing violence against children, UNICEF Belize engaged with a wider range of partners, including civil society organizations and the security forces. This provided excellent opportunities to scale up programme efforts and reach vulnerable children in time and with relevant support. communication for development (C4D) training was delivered to UNICEF staff, government and civil society partners, with the support of the UNICEF Regional Office, to enhance the use of this effective strategy to support social and behaviour change. As a result of the training, multiple C4D strategies and roadmaps were developed to support priority areas for children, including violence prevention.

In 2018 UNICEF placed an emphasis on support to strengthen national and local capacities in emergency preparedness and recovery. A major lesson learned from those initiatives was the importance of investing in strengthening capacity at decentralized levels for responsive programming with all relevant partners. To this end, UNICEF Belize worked with the Ministry of Local Government, municipalities, the National Emergency Management Organization and Belize City Emergency Management Organization to support effective emergency preparedness. As an additional result of the capacity building processes supported by UNICEF, UNFPA and UNETT, Belize now has 80 trainers in Return to Happiness nationwide, and 80 shelter managers have been trained on protection of children, women and other vulnerable populations. To harmonize approaches and ensure quality at all levels of response, UNICEF Belize is working with humanitarian partners to develop protocols for response to children in emergencies, jointly with the UNICEF Regional Office and CDEMA.

Gender-responsive programming
UNICEF worked closely with the UN interagency team to promote better integration of gender in programming across agencies and to leverage internal capacity more effectively for greater impact. Major lessons learned included the added value of interagency coordination on gender to achieve greater efficiency; the benefits of generation and dissemination of key data, and impact from more strategic joint support toward specific gender-responsive priorities in the country. UNICEF is the Co-Chair of the UN Gender Team Group (UNGTG), which supported several initiatives that brought the gender dimension to the forefront in 2018. These included mainly the Menstrual Hygiene Management Study, Child Marriage and Early Union road map, National Parenting Manual (including actions for greater male involvement), and celebrations on the Day of the Girl Child. As a member of the National Gender Focal Point/Gender Integration Committee (GFP/GIC), UNICEF supported increasednational awareness on gender and gender mainstreaming.  

UNICEF Belize participated in the panel discussion, ‘The Importance of Data for High Level Advocacy’ at the opening of the Caribbean Women and Sexual Diversity Conference. UNICEF plans to provide technical support to the GFP/GIC for the drafting of its annual work plan with focus on institutional and individual capacity building and gender empowerment.  

Internally, UNICEF Belize plans to incorporate a gender analysis of all its programmes as a part of the office midterm review process, highlighting ongoing efforts to strengthen gender programming and gender mainstreaming.

Winning support for the cause of children
In 2018, UNICEF made a strategic decision to widen its ability to deliver results for children by expanding support for its cause. The rapidly growing U-Report (more than 2,250 people registered in less than a year) has proven to be a powerful opportunity to connect directly with young people and community actors across the country, tap into their direct knowledge of the challenges they face and engage them in a meaningful dialogue to find and implement solutions for children, including during emergencies. UNICEF solidified major partnerships with the only two mobile service providers in Belize(SMART & Digi), who committed to providing 600,000 free SMS to U-Reporters annually. That service is expected to significantly increase mobilization and participation in communities with connectivity challenges by enabling free SMS registration and messaging across all mobile networks. 

The importance of continuing to strengthen the Sustainable and Child Friendly Municipalities Initiative was another lesson learned in 2018. The initiative places children’s rights and needs at the centre of all the country’s nine municipalities. Periodic interaction among the mayors, who are the main decision makers at local level, helped reinforce their commitment to ensuring better delivery of results for children. Through its communication tools and partnership events, UNICEF shared best practices to address children’s rights among the municipalities and observed that cities and towns with less child-friendly programmes and planning approaches were learning and encouraged to change. To further motivate municipalities to make progress toward safe and child-friendly communities, UNICEF, partners and the mayors agreed to adopt a child-friendly certification process for all the municipalities in Belize. By the end of 2018, partners in government and civil society strongly supported expansion of this partnership model and framework to all local government areas, including rural areas in Belize, which are still facing high levels of inequalities and child poverty. 


Leveraging resources and partnerships, and the power of business and markets 
UNICEF Belize has mobilized resources from the Government of Belize for the 2017-2021 Country Programme Document totaling US$497,624. Mobilizing financial resources from the private sector or other donors remains a challenge. The partnership with Digi and SMART is a promising start to such support, and does already include important in-kind contributions, such as the free SMS. UNICEF’s two private sector partners in Belize have confirmed their continued interest in supporting entrepreneurial skills development in children and adolescents. In 2018, they collaborated with UNICEF to facilitate a  series of sessions on creative communication in special camps organized by UNICEF for children involved as advocates in the Sustainable and Child Friendly Municipalities Initiative. UNICEF’s partnership with the private sector on U-Report offers a good opportunity for further collaboration with these specialist technology and communications partners to enhance support toward mentorship and employment readiness skills for adolescents, a promising contribution to the Generation Unlimited initiative. 

UN working together
To support SDG 1.3 (Social Protection) and building on the UNMSDF, UNICEF Belize promoted and developed a key partnership with the Ministry of Human Development, the International Labour Organization and the World Bank to support poverty eradication and the strengthening of Belize’s national Social Protection system. Under the leadership of the UN Regional Coordinator, the Ministries’ CEO Caucus agreed to develop a national Social Protection Floor. A major lesson learned from this process so far is the importance of the combination of change strategies to meaningfully influence the theory of change, namely by using the power of evidence through the policy recommendations included in the UNICEF-UNDP supported Review of Belize’s Social Protection System; winning the support from decision-makers to the cause of children, through the high-level advocacy with the CEO Caucus and UNMSDF framework to build shared accountability. 

UNICEF, along with UNFPA and PAHO, actively contributed to ensuring the Ministry of Health’s ownership for the development of the first adolescent health national strategic plan. This led to the development process moving forward smoothly because it was led and owned by the Ministry. Formal outreach by the Ministry of Health to other ministries and other stakeholders ensured the multi-sectoral nature of the extended working group and that the contents and priorities of the strategy will be multisectoral. Internal communication and collaboration on adolescent health between UN agencies was increased.

UNICEF, along with UNFPA, supported the development of a Roadmap to Accelerate Actions to End Child Marriage and Early Unions  in Belize. A key lesson learned was the importance of promoting effective coordination with regional partners and the UNICEF Regional Office, in the framework of the existing global and regional joint programmes, which facilitated seamless partnerships between both agencies at country level, who have provided technical and financial support to the process and are expected to continue supporting the finalization of the roadmap and its implementation by national authorities. 

Migration is a growing challenge. The UN has initiated joint work to develop a comprehensive protocol to address unaccompanied minors as migration flows continue to bring them to Belize. Jointly identifying a holistic solution remains difficult and the coordination among the relevant agencies - mainly IOM, UNHCR and UNICEF - will have to be further strengthened for that purpose. 

Fostering innovation in programming and advocacy for children
The Belize U-Report platform uses existing social networks such as WhatsApp, SMS and Facebook, taking advantage of the growing internet-connected community at the least cost. In 2018, UNICEF Belize actively promoted multi-stakeholder engagements with adolescents through numerous outreach activities and advocacy campaigns in all the districts, to rapidly increase the number of participants, both from in school and out of school adolescents as well as interested community actors. In 2019, the U-Partner platform is expected to be rolled out as a dedicated free hotline service that enables delivery of scheduled, confidential and quality-assured one-on-one social support via mobile phone to young people by their peers. To further build on this new technology, in coordination with the Ministry of Health, mental health counselling will be progressively made available countrywide, to help bridge the gap in access resulting from the limited number of specialized mental health professionals available to offer basic information and counselling. 

Another important innovation has been to systematically ensure adolescent participation in the entire process of developing the adolescent health national strategic plan. This was accomplished both by using new technologies and through local consultations with adolescents. Adolescent representatives were included in the adolescent health technical working group and were involved in each step of the design process. Trained by UNICEF and the Department of Youth Services, adolescents facilitated the national consultation. The use of U-Report also enabled wider consultations with adolescents throughout the country. In this way adolescents did more than provide input – they truly influenced decisions about the development of the adolescent health national strategic plan process. 

Using the power of evidence to drive change
It is important that Belize clearly identifies the children at greatest risk and in greatest need. There is currently very limited production of systematic and updated data on social and child indicators in the country. For this reason, UNICEF will support Belize in piloting MICS Plus in 2019. A new situation analysis, which included consultations with children and adolescents, was developed in 2018 and will be finalized in 2019. In parallel, major studies such as the Out-of-School and Menstrual Hygiene Management reports provided key data to shape relevant policy and programme interventions aimed at the SDG promise to leave no child behind. Most importantly, ensuring the effective participation of all relevant stakeholders, including children and adolescents themselves, is proving to be key to ensuring relevance of priorities, innovation in solution creation, and greater effectiveness in planning, particularly around neglected issues affecting children and adolescents (such as adolescent health and mental health, or issues such as adolescent pregnancy and violence prevention, in which little progress has been registered).

UNICEF supported the introduction and initiation of multiple promising change strategies and must continue to leverage support from across the organization to optimize them. Taking into consideration the lessons learned and the existing challenges, in 2019 and beyond, UNICEF Belize will need to strengthen its own resources for programme support, including internal capacity, to ensure the continuity of impact and sustainability of the results achieved to date. The midterm review of the country programme in 2019 offers a crucial opportunity for this reflection and action to strengthen the UNICEF Belize Country Programme.

LACR,Bolivia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
The new Country Programme 2018-2022 emphasizes as core the transition from sectoral to intersectoral approach and programming to achieve better results for children. This required the promotion and adoption of a different business model, with structural changes both externally and internally to ensure intersectoral coordination around integrated early childhood development, adolescent development and empowerment. Despite the elaboration of public multi-sectoral development plans at national and subnational levels and the increased focus and priority on the youngest children and adolescents within the government, alignment of line ministries to a common and intersectoral framework has been slow.  

Internally, UNICEF Bolivia adopted a matrix management model as part of innovation. The organizational structure, planning, budgeting and monitoring processes, including performance evaluation practices were adjusted accordingly. Although challenges linked to mind shifting, organizational culture and practices were evident, notable progress was made in aligning vision, sharing knowledge and fostering team accountability. However, to accelerate changes that are conducive for increased collaboration across sectors, a systemic review of global organizational structures, practices and procedures is recommended. 

To achieve optimal intersectoral coordination, UNICEF Bolivia will continue advocacy at the national, departmental and municipal levels on the need to integrate programming and cross-sectoral collaboration to maximise resources and results for children. When possible, UNICEF Bolivia will continue promoting a ‘pair to pair’ approach for specific initiatives and bring diverse actors around the same table to improve joint work and accountability for the achievement of results. Finally, UNICEF Bolivia continued to stimulate convergence of geographical and programmatic scope to achieve strategic results for children through demonstrative models on the ground linked with public policies for scale up. 

For specific sectors, UNICEF aims to build stronger internal guidelines for programming that integrate priorities at the local, national and global level. For example, while adolescent development and empowerment is integrated throughout all results areas of the Country Programme (gender responsive adolescent health in Outcome 1; quality secondary education, skills and opportunities for adolescents in Outcome 2; protection of adolescents in Outcome 3; and adolescent participation in governance and climate change adaptation in Outcome 4), UNICEF Bolivia developed an integrated strategy to guide its work structured around three priorities, resonating well with national priorities, the global Gen U partnership, the ADAP guidance documents, the Gender Action Plan 2018-2022 and the LAC regional priorities: 1. Adolescent health and protection (with a focus on gender equality, including positive masculinities); 2. Education, skills and opportunities for vulnerable adolescents (with a focus on life project and employability); and 3. Adolescent participation and empowerment of adolescent girls (with a focus on leadership, communication and resilience). 

The current political context and bureaucracy in governmental institutions remained critical constraints for programme implementation. This may worsen in 2019 due to conditions created by upcoming presidential elections and growing political sensitivities that affect decisions on how programming is rolled out at central and decentralized levels. UNICEF Bolivia is learning to manage these constraints by working deeper at all levels – national, departmental and municipal – and by engaging actors in the public and private sector as well as civil society. For example, UNICEF Bolivia increased focus on the subnational level with the departmental and municipal governments as well as with CSOs to accompany the implementation of public policies as well as testing and evaluating new cost-effective models for scale up within the national development plan. In addition, engagement with private and public companies was expanded to engage senior government officials to promote programme goals. As one example, the Chief Executive Officer of MiTeleferico engaged the Vice President in the celebration of the 29thAnniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 

Another challenge is training strong human resources and maintaining resilient programmes when partner staff working on key interventions and services or institutions change, taking with them the knowledge and skills acquired, often with UNICEF support. UNICEF Bolivia is learning to address this by creating curricula, supporting new training programmes with public training centres for civil servants, universities and other public and private institutions, and working closely with the Government to create sustainable capacity building programmes reaching greater numbers of people. For example, UNICEF Bolivia generated impetus within the MoE to offer specialized and sustainable IECD human resources training after basic teacher training materials were completed for the initial education level. This training for the teachers, educators and personnel at state entities will be carried out in 2019 through the Specialized Continuous Training Unit (UNEFCO) and the Plurinational School of Public Management.  

Similarly, in the area of child protection, an online course and diplomas were developed in partnership with the Public School of Management. For the WASH sector, UNICEF Bolivia worked to develop the operators’ capacity certification programme, the online platform on WASH and the new Urban and Rural WASH Certificate Programmes offered by Nur University in collaboration with the MMAyA. These will help address the weak technical capacity in the sector while garnering support from authorities at the national level and ensuring WASH service operators develop decentralized sanitation solutions and management models. Such training will feed into high level discussions and coordination among strategic WASH actors that will help build consensus around strategic approaches to achieve the 2030 goals, implement the National Strategy on Rural Sanitation in Small Communities and promote the National Strategy to Eliminate the Open Defecation.

Another lesson learned was that reaching the most marginalized children requires stronger community level structures and approaches. For example, child protection services not only need to be available, but children need to know what services are available and service providers must have the capacity to provide child-friendly quality services. When recent evidence generated at country level pointed to the family as the space where children suffer or witness the most violence, UNICEF Bolivia accelerated efforts to reach parents with violence prevention programmes. While community-based programmes are essential to this effort, they are almost non-existent. Therefore, UNICEF Bolivia commenced piloting “mobile child defence units” with the Municipality of La Paz and planning to expand them in other municipalities to increase children’s access to protection services in urban and rural areas. Likewise, “mobile CEPATs” will be piloted to prevent and respond to sexual abuse and violence and successful methodologies used to prevent violence in rural areas will be adapted to urban settings. 

Finally, although the Interamerican Development Bank (IADB) and the World Bank make significant investments in the Government’s youth employment agenda, it is clear much more is needed to support marginalized adolescents to acquire the 21stcentury skills they need to obtain their first decent job. In 2019, UNICEF will develop demonstrative initiatives in this area while working to strengthen the Government programme, “Mi Primer Empleo” (My First Job)and providing specific support to former victims of trafficking. This work will be closely linked to UNICEF Bolivia’s involvement in the UN Mainstreaming, Acceleration, Policy and Support (MAPS) mission agreed to by the Government to accelerate progress towards the SDGs with focus on the urban agenda, poverty reduction, employment and youth.

 Humanitarian response to migration

The Venezuelan migration influx into Brazil was UNICEF Brazil’s first large scale humanitarian response. At the beginning of the year, the country office undertook a mission to the border with Venezuela and identified the need for the establishment of a local UNICEF team and for the development of a multi sectoral response. This required raising awareness on the situation of children and their families and mobilizing support at the different levels of the organization.

The work started through stretch assignments and consultancies and was progressively scaled up with the establishment of a multi-sectoral field office managed by an international P4 coordinator. The difficulty of mobilizing funds and recruiting staff hampered initial implementation rates, the overall coordination and the integration of humanitarian and development work. However, in three months, the office managed to turn things around. It recruited 11 people and brought in a Deputy Representative on stretch assignment who was coordinating the humanitarian response from Brasilia. UNICEF signed 12 agreements with eight non-governmental organizations and ended the year with optimal expenditure rates of humanitarian funds received for the emergency response (around 1.5 million US dollars).

The response to this situation was complex and represented a stretch for the office. Main lessons learned include: 1) the importance of strengthening the capacities of the regular team to respond to humanitarian situations in a context where emergency situations are not common; 2) the challenge of raising awareness on less visible humanitarian situations to mobilize timely financial and human resources; and 3) the need to further integrate the humanitarian response with the regular development work.

UNICEF Municipal Seal of Approval, Urban Center Platform and Adolescent Participation

The implementation of the UNICEF Municipal Seal of Approval and the Urban Center Platform strategies provided important lessons that will inform adjustments in 2019.

Although most local authorities agreed on the importance of intersectoral policies and programmes, UNICEF found that only a few municipalities were actually implementing such activities. UNICEF responded by inviting public agents for a sectoral training. The training involved almost 5,000 public servants from the areas of education, social assistance, child protection and health as well as 3,500 adolescents who worked jointly on intersectoral projects. The lesson learned was that UNICEF can play a key role in forging multi-sectoral approaches by facilitating trainings where the representatives of different areas collaborate to solve concrete tasks. The next step will be to evaluate how social indicators change as a result of this integrated training approach.

As part of the Urban Center Platform strategy for the prevention of homicides of adolescents, UNICEF Brazil supported the establishment of committees for the prevention of homicides of adolescents in four cities, bringing together civil society organizations with the judiciary, the public attorney’s office, the parliament and sectoral secretariats. UNICEF also organized an international workshop, in close articulation with UNICEF Regional Office and headquarters, with representatives from the executive, judiciary and legislative, international organizations and civil society to develop a framework for the prevention of armed violence in urban settings. Key lessons learned include: it’s important to influence authorities to include homicides of adolescents on mayoral and state government agendas, and that there is an urgent need to develop a UNICEF framework to address armed violence in urban settings.

The two initiatives highlighted the strategic role of adolescents to mobilize local community and public policy and to develop concrete initiatives. As part of the UNICEF Municipal Seal of Approval, each municipality set up a group of adolescents to implement rights-related activities structured around eight challenges. The outcome was particularly positive when the adolescents were trained with adults, sharing experience and jointly developing intersectoral approaches. The adolescents developed and helped the adults realize that the presence of adolescents is an added value for achieving results in public policies. 

The involvement of adolescents in activities to address homicides of young people generated a more effective commitment from all engaged institutions. The adolescents’ life stories and the testimonies on the dynamics within their communities provided a human face to the statistics.

Finally, an important conclusion of 2018 was the need to further integrate the UNICEF Municipal Seal of Approval and the Urban Center Platform, to enhance synergies, optimize the use of resources and develop a comprehensive municipal approach that is more closely linked to the child-friendly city initiative. 

“More than Promises” to position children's rights during the elections

UNICEF Brazil worked with the general election climate in October 2018 to position children’s rights in the debate. Given the unusually heavy polarization between political groups, UNICEF focused on a set of priority topics along the lines its country programme rather than prioritizing one issue that might be associated with individual candidates. 

Based on consultations involving staff and external partners, UNICEF Brazil developed a public advocacy campaign focusing on multidimensional poverty; violence and homicides of adolescents; education; health; childhood obesity, and participation of adolescents in democratic processes. UNICEF provided recommendations on how to address each challenge. The campaign ‘more than promises’ (Mais que Promessas) provided data, disaggregated by federal state. 

UNICEF Brazil launched the campaign and the studies ahead of the electoral campaigns. Media coverage surpassed all expectations with the support by UNICEF Ambassadors Renato Aragão and Lázaro Ramos. Out of the 13 presidential candidates, UNICEF met the five main contenders, with the exception of one who was hospitalized following an assassination attempt. Each spoke about the challenges that children are facing, providing UNICEF with a platform to promote children’s rights. At state level, UNICEF chief of territories and office coordinators met with another 17 candidates. All 22 candidates signed a public commitment to prioritize children. UNICEF field offices also organized online discussions between governor candidates and adolescents.

UNICEF Brazil developed a website of documents, and a link where voters could send a Tweet message to the presidential candidates and ask them about the challenges identified by UNICEF. Through this initiative UNICEF was able for the first time to combine RapidPro with WhatsApp. With support by the global innovation team, WhatsApp can now also be used as entry point to U-Report.

However, uptake of “ask your candidate” campaign was limited: 1,600 people sent questions mainly due to the complexity of the engagement process.The lessons learned is that tools should be simple, involving few clicks, and ideally no moves between digital platforms. 

Based on these learnings, UNICEF Brazil switched focus to social media and WhatsApp during the second round, to directly promote child’s rights using messages such as: “You are in favour of good education for all children – you are supporting human rights.” The pick-up was strong. 

Overall through social media activities, UNICEF Brazil reached 20 million people; 130,000 engaged directly with messages. The media launch generated 500 articles and reports; theUNICEF Representative and programme specialists were interviewed by the main TV and radio news programmes. 

The campaign provided a number of lessons: Democratic elections are an opportunity to promote children’s rights. However, it is key to focus on main UNICEF topics and avoid topics that may associate with individual candidates. Inviting candidates to commit to children’s rights during elections sets the ground for evidence-based collaboration with incoming government. Public advocacy related to elections can also strengthen the UNICEF brand as the lead advocate for children’s rights. Elections are opportunities to mobilize large audiences, however digital engagement processes need to be extremely simple. Twitter is a good option to facilitate the direct engagement of audiences with candidates, because their responses will be public, different from Facebook. Memes with visual material and strong messages are very popular and can easily be shared on WhatsApp.

The multiple dimensions of child poverty

Under the priority to strengthen UNICEF Brazil knowledge generation, the country office developed a study on multidimensional poverty to advocate for children’s rights and to influence policy in the context of Brazil’s political transition.

The document was developed by a professional team. The methodology and the results were validated through a series of participatory events with stakeholders from the public and private sector, including civil society organizations and universities. 

The launch of the report generated media coverage highlighting the relevance of the topic for the country and positioning the issue on the national public agenda. Multidimensional poverty was widely recognized as a way to analyse the extent of poverty beyond monetary deprivation. 

The report resulted in a strategic new partnership with the National Statistics Office (IBGE) that will allow data and evidence-generation on important issues related to children and adolescents such as violence and early childhood development, as well as to monitor multidimensional child poverty. It also resulted in a closer cooperation with the Ministry of Planning, who intend to include the methodology to align the upcoming 2019 -2023 Brazilian Development Plan with the Sustainable Development Goals with emphasis on a cross-cutting agenda.

Main lessons learned: Even with financial constraints, prioritizing evidence and knowledge generation as effective, especially in terms of advocacy.The impact of the study made it possible to establish key strategic partnerships showing the concrete impact of this strategy.The study was key to position UNICEF in Brazil as a solid source of knowledge on topics that have traditionally been addressed by other international organizations and as a technical partner that can support the Government for the design of targeted cross-sectoral policies for children and adolescents.The success of the study sets the ground for future evidence generation, using innovative approaches to policy development, developed by civil society and young people, for example.

Partnerships with the private sector for financial resources and innovation for children

In 2018, UNICEF Brazil expanded the number of alliances with the private sector from 16 to 24, bringing in private stakeholders such as Samsung, Sanofi, Net-Claro Embratel and others. Beyond funding, new partners contribute with innovation for children. The 2018 experience already provides some important lessons learned:
- Success in fundraising and engagement with companies and foundations is determined by the right level of staffingwho accompany the evolution of partnerships.
- In an increasingly competitive context, partnerships need to bring value through brand visibility and synergy, engagement with their consumers and networking opportunities.  

Potential donors want simple, easy to understand proposals and ways of communicating the impact of their donation to their employees, customers and other audiences.
- Innovation and determining the “business DNA” to find solutions to everyday problems is a way to unlock income and generate innovation for children. Such multi-faceted partnerships require investment in time and resources. 
- Speaking and mirroring the language of the current landscape is important. For example, engagement of the private sector with the Sustainable Development Goal’s is an opportunity to translate UNICEF’s work into a language that private partners understand.

Response to the latest trends in social media

The exponential growth in social media followers seems to be reaching a plateau, growing at slower rates, also due to an initiative by Twitter to clear bot accounts. UNICEF Brazil “lost” over 25,000 “followers” in 2018, which in reality were driven by robots. In addition, social media companies increasingly restrict organizations from generating organic growth of followers. 

In order to respond to such constraints, UNICEF Brazil focused on broadening the engagement of its existing followers using innovative formats such a communities and e-cards on WhatsApp, Instagram stories and Facebook Live transmissions. UNICEF invested in identifying and engaging segmented audiences on social media, for instance in support of the national immunization campaign.

Another step was the engagement of influencers in events. On World Children’s Day, UNICEF Brazil invited 20 influencers to share a photo of themselves as a child on Instagram with a message related to children’s rights, and encouraged them to invite three friends each.UNICEF reached 100 million people; 8.8 million shared messages and photos. 

A key lesson learned was that celebrities and digital influencers can be mobilized around strategic dates, provided the mechanics of engagement are simple. An activity with a personal touch (a childhood photo) and a light competitive element (asking them to invite three personal friends to follow suit) can be effective incentives. Such activities provide enormous opportunities for achieving strong reach and engagement rates.

Equally successful was the use of artificial intelligence to reach and engage large audiences, including on sensitive topics. UNICEF developed a project, ‘Caretas’, to involve adolescents and young people in a conversation related to the risk of cyberbullying following sexting, i.e. the exchange of intimate photos or videos on the internet. UNICEF created a dialogue on Facebook Messenger where participants could “talk” to a fictitious victim, FabiGrossi, about what to do and where to get both psychological as well as legal support. The script was built through artificial intelligence, i.e. Fabi “initiated” the next phase of the conversation and “answered” questions depending on the latest contribution by the participant. 

The platform went viral and until the end of 2018, almost one million people had joined the conversation. Some 90 per cent of those who participated in a final survey rated the experience as good or very good. The survey also revealed how common the exchange of intimate photos and videos is among adolescents, including among young girls and boys. UNICEF contracted a researcher to analyse the motivation for sharing such material, with the goal toexpand and improve the Caretas platform as well as to develop a programmatic and communication response to raise awareness about the risks of cyberbullying.

Programme structure and matrix management

Despite solid results, there are challenges to implement the UNCIEF Brazil Country Programme. 

The country programme structure (that does not follow traditional thematic areas) and the matrix management involving 10 offices added complexity to implementation, accountability and communication around the programme. The country office already undertook adjustments to facilitate coordination and management, but a strategic reflection will be undertaken in 2019 to simplify structures and management. This moment of reflection will also be key to adjust the country programme to respond to the new environment and priorities of the Government.

To reduce costs and support the United Nations reform, UNICEF Brazil and other agencies established two new common premises in Manaus and Belem, in addition to the existing common office in Salvador. Expansion of common premises at local level will be a key strategy in the coming years.

Advocacy for children at the centre of the Government agenda
UNICEF advocacy strategy in 2017 was effective when children are placed as one of four Government priorities. UNICEF Chile advocated with all presidential candidates during the presidential campaign in 2017 for the importance of placing children at the centre of the Government agenda. During the face-to-face meetings with each presidential candidate, UNICEF presented a simple and concise publication “Children’s Agenda 2018-2025” with 10 key and clear messages, that can be easily transformed into objectives. 

As a result, in 2018 the new Government assumed the National Plan of Action for Children and Adolescents 2018-2025, prepared by the previous administration with UNICEF support since 2016. In June, the National Agreement for Children was submitted with 94 proposals for short, medium and long-term actions for children. With the Convention on the Rights of the Child as a reference, it is a road map with three main axes: universal protection and promotion of the integral development of all children and adolescents; prevent violations of the rights of children and adolescents; and protection and restitution of children and adolescent rights when those rights had been violated.

Advocacy to mitigate risks of regress for inclusive education: Safe Classroom Act
Good intentions to reduce violence in school, to protect children, can have a flip effect sometimes and violate other children’s rights to education. A draft law known as Safe Classroom Act was presented at the national congress in September, which expanded school directors’ authority to expel students perpetrating serious violence in schools. 

This draft law was a response to cases of violence that occurred in public schools, perpetrated by secondary school students. Although the cases were isolated, the media and public opinion reacted strongly, perhaps due to extreme violence of crimes committed by adolescents a few months earlier and the public’s general interest in insecurity. There is public support for tough measures to repel criminal actions and violence, and the proximity of the cases to the lives of opinion leaders (as the involved schools were “good schools” located in the capital city of Santiago) affected national interest.

UNICEF Chile analysed the draft law and identified weaknesses. While the draft law is based on limited and unrelated cases of violence, the law would have a national scope for the expulsion of students involved in serious acts of violence in schools: actions to intervene to address the underlying causes of violence were not considered. UNICEF Chile identified that this violates children’s rights to education because: due process was not respected for accused students which opens the possibility for a school director to react with the immediate expulsion; and measures to ensure the continuity of education for expelled students were not considered, leaving them at risk of drop-out from the school system.

UNICEF Chile developed an advocacy strategy to revert or mitigate the draft law’s contents that violate children’s rights to education enshrined in the Convention of the Rights of the Child. The strategy’s effectiveness was based on collaboration among communication, education, and protection teams led by the UNICEF Chile Representative.

UNICEF Chile presented its position to the Congress’ Senate Education Committee, provided evidence and explained the consequences on children in applying the punitive measure of school expulsion. UNICEF Chile’s position was disseminated through an interview with La Tercera, a prestigious written media source in the country.  

Although the draft law was approved, UNICEF Chile contributed to revert the contents that would have violated children’s rights. As a result, the application of immediate school expulsion was eliminated from the draft law, and replaced by an investigative process respecting a student’s right to a defence. The law’s legal provisions also includes a psychosocial accompaniment for expelled students and, most importantly, the right to be reinserted in the education system is included as a responsibility of the Ministry of Education.

With this experience, UNICEF Chile learned that worthy intentions to protect a group of children from violence can violate other children’s rights. Lessons were learned about the crucial oversight role that UNICEF played to avoid regression, and the need to maintain a role in providing technical assistance to the Ministry of Education in elaborating the new national policy of safe school environment to ensure a formative and rights-based approach.

Adolescent participation: Concausa
Adolescent participation with Concausa was organized successfully in November 2018, and counted with UNICEF’s Executive Director’s visit. The Coucausa initiative is a partnership among UNICEF Chile, Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean and the non-government organisation América Solidaria, started in 2016. It aims to empower adolescents to reducechild poverty in the region. 

The success of Concausa is two-fold. First, the partnership is of a nature that strengthens and complements for a common goal: UNICEF’s expertise in the realization of children’s rights; the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean’s political leadership and knowledge in sustainable development and inequality; and America Solidaria’s network and ability to work directly with the adolescents.

Second, Concausa proved that adolescents themselves can achieve Sustainable Development Goals when they are given proper methods and instruments. Concausa translated Sustainable Development Goals into their local context, and linked them directly to adolescents’ challenges in everyday life. The adolescents exercised their rights to participation, to express themselves, to take part and have direct influence, by presenting their own initiatives to solve problems, and identified themselves as agents of change to achieve Sustainable Development Goals. Concausa allows adolescents to embrace the Sustainable Development Goals as day-to-day challenges; and they witness the fact that they can make a difference by identifying solutions in a co-creative process, connecting adolescents regionally, and providing a space for adolescents to participate meaningfully as change makers.

After the first three years of successful experiences in Chile, UNICEF’s leadership is now handed over to the UNICEF regional office to enhance coverage through the regional network and strengthen the adolescent participation. 

Challenges

The new country programme document and Chile’s new government
The first year of the Country Programme 2018-2022 coincided with the start of a new Government in Chile in March. The Government has placed children in the centre of their agenda based on UNICEF advocacy efforts during the presidential campaign, and programme priorities identified with the previous administration. Adjustments may be required to ensure results of the country programme. The new administration has new authorities and different political orientation, and UNICEF Chile maintains a constant and open dialogue with the Government to maximize UNICEF Chile’s value added in today’s reality.

UNICEF Chile’s Country Programme 2018-2022 supports pilot programmes to improve equity and social inclusion in three municipalities, to supervise application ofcentral level policyand to identify bottlenecks and barriers in access to services at local level. However, by reviewing the validity of the pilots in light of the current political context, and provided that it is crucial that UNICEF is available for the new Government’s initiatives that affect children, it was decided that the planning and implementation of pilot programmes no longer remains a priority.

Outdated legal framework for children
During the last 14 years, UNICEF worked to help Chile have a legal framework for the protection of children and adolescents, aligned with the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Despite progress in fulfilling child rights in the country, Chile still has an outdated legal framework for children, from 1967. It does not meet the needs or reality of the country’s children today, nor does it hold the standards of a high-income country. It is urgent that Chile strengthenthe social protection system for families to protect their children from child rights violations. 

In 2018, UNICEF Chile ascertained that political will is insufficient in the approval process of this much-needed updated legal framework for children. A strategy is required to overcome and go beyond ideological differences of political coalitions. Despite political good will, the approval process was interrupted and hampered by changes of Government and conflicting priorities. 

The previous four governments have put children and adolescents as a central focus of public policy, making significant changes such as the creation of the sub-system of comprehensive early childhood protection (‘Chile crececontigo’) in 2009, setting the basis for establishing a comprehensive Chile protection system. However, this remains an unfinished task. 

The UNICEF Executive Director visited Chile in November 2018, and transmitted a clear message to key ministers by highlighting the urgent need to update the legal framework for children. She asked the Government to give the category of “urgency” to the set of child-related bills currently in Congress, which together would establish a comprehensive child protection system (if not declared “urgent,” adraft law can remain in Congress unattended). The new laws will provide special protection for children whose rights are threatened and violated, based on international standards. 

With the new Government in place and a new country programme, UNICEF Chile will continue to promote the full compliance with children’s rights and seek new and effective alliances with a wide range of political forces within the Parliament, as well as engaging and convening other relevant actors, such as the private sector, civil society, and children and adolescents themselves.

LACR,Colombia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
In 2018, UNICEF faced a significant challenge to implement its regular country programme, while at the same time designing and putting into place a comprehensive humanitarian response, in harmony with the Government, to one of the most complex migration situations in the hemisphere: the mixed migratory influx from Venezuela. Three major lessons were gleaned from the emergency response, revolving around the need to: a) integrate emergency response with development activities, b) involve host communities in the planning and implementation of humanitarian activities; and c) adapt development interventions from the regular programme to the humanitarian response. 

Integrating emergency response with development activities: Response to humanitarian crises normally implies an immediate action to provide services and supplies to save lives at risk. The current crisis, however, is complex, with a diversity of needs among the migrant population, as some are settled, others in transit and still others travelling back and forth. The areas through which they arrive tend to be among the poorest, most isolated and conflict-affected in the country. Finally, the situation affects not only Venezuelan nationals leaving their country, but also hundreds of thousands of returning Colombians, and the host communities that receive all the migrants. In effect, there are elements of development and resilience-building within a larger humanitarian emergency. As a result, UNICEF Colombia had to develop not only humanitarian actions but also longer-term interventions aimed at overcoming structural barriers to the protection and guarantee of child rights. UNICEF was simultaneously promoting humanitarian and development agendas on behalf of the affected population, including both migrant and local communities. 

Involving host communities: The magnitude of the migratory influx has forced Venezuelans and returning Colombians to compete for access to basic services and the fulfilment of basic rights, alongside resident Colombian communities. In this context, demonstrations of xenophobia against migrants have become common. Thus UNICEF had to prioritize community-focused activities that benefit both incoming migrants and host communities. This conscious choice facilitated the promotion of concepts such as peaceful co-existence between Colombians and Venezuelans, through the adaptation of methodologies already developed and used in the regular country programme to promote child rights in the post-Peace Accord context. A major lesson learned was that regular humanitarian responses cannot overlook the critical role that host communities play in facilitating (or inhibiting) the effectiveness of specific actions in any sector, including child protection, health and nutrition, WASH and social inclusion. The involvement of host communities must be considered in a wide range of options; from receiving timely and appropriate humanitarian assistance, under the same condition as migrants, to becoming actors that facilitate a protective and inclusive environment for the most vulnerable migrants. Moreover, host communities must also be part of local strategies for accountability to affected populations. 

Adapting development interventions to the humanitarian response: A parallel lesson involved the need for UNICEF to deliberately establish, from the start, a clear nexus between basic humanitarian response and broader development actions. This approach has proven crucial in balancing the implementation of the humanitarian response and the regular country programme. The need for immediate response prompted UNICEF to make use of existing programmatic strategies, adapting them to the emergency context of the migratory influx. In virtually every sector, this type of adaptation took place: a) in protection, UNICEF applied the Somos Paz strategy used to prevent child recruitment among adolescents from both migrant and host communities; b) in health and nutrition, UNICEF refurbished the sectoral strategy of mobile health units from public hospitals to ensure the provision of additional health care services (vaccinations, peri-natal care, nutritional surveillance and sensitization about ECD and violence prevention) for migrant populations based in affected communities; c) in education, the office adapted the practice of child-friendly spaces to the school environment, to provide non-formal educational activities for migrant children not yet registered in the school system. 

The key challenges confronting UNICEF in 2018 were twofold: finding implementing partners in isolated regions and enhancing coordination mechanisms. For UNICEF Colombia, identifying implementing partners at the local level in the prioritized areas of the emergency response proved difficult, due to conditions on the ground. This barrier was overcome by selecting smaller local operators who knew the territory and were willing to go to scale, with UNICEF assistance, in areas such as training, transfer of methodologies and funding. When no local organization was present, UNICEF partnered with larger or international NGOs. 

Colombia has historically been characterized by a strong humanitarian architecture. The clusters, the humanitarian coordination team and local level coordination working groups functioned well, with support from all agencies. With the advent of the regional platform for migrants and refugees in 2018, a parallel structure was created at both the regional and country level to coordinate the response to the crisis. This situation created some challenges and constraints for the agencies, mainly in sharing a common strategic vision for the response, enhancing inter-sectoral coordination and avoiding duplication of activities at national and local levels. This situation is currently under discussion within the UN country team, including a proposal to enhance the role of the Resident Coordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator to promote coherence between the two existing mechanisms.

LACR,Costa Rica,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
As evidenced throughout this report, UNICEF´s actions in 2018 are firmly ensconced in key work areas germane to programming in an upper middle-income country context: 
Advocacy to promote child-and gender-friendly policies, laws and budgets; 
Strengthening of national and local capacities so that institutions can approximate themselves more to the needs of children and adolescents;  
Strategies deliberately designed to address inequalities, exclusion and discrimination against children and adolescents;  
Rigorous monitoring, analysis and evaluation of the situation of children;  
Promoting social dialogue through the construction of national and local partnerships, and; 
South-south/triangular cooperation placing Costa Rica simultaneously as exporter and importer of good practices.  

The aim is to effectively identify, respond and eliminate the key barriers and bottlenecks that have impeded the opportunity for all children and adolescents to benefit from social and economic development. As the first year of the country programme, the priority in 2018 was to deliberately establish the necessary platforms in planning, baseline development, partnerships and institutional engagement so that key and promising models of innovation can generate the results and evidence for the eventual national ownership and appropriation to take them to scale.  

The country programme´s theory of change is the vehicle to convert these strategies into tangible results and improvements in the well-being of children and adolescents. However, whereas the theory of change articulated in the Country Programme Document is very clear in terms of a five-year horizon, it quickly became evident that this had to be translated into annual theories of change with specific benchmarks and results, an exercise which greatly benefited from LACRO´s support. In addition, this is a process that UNICEF should not undertake in isolation. It required active counterpart involvement to fully understand the logic of the theory of change as it relates to results-based planning through capacity building. This process eventually resulted in annual work plans where UNICEF´s financial and technical inputs address those areas identified through a more microscopic theory of change. The successful experiments in developing theory of change-informed work plans with the Ministries of Education and National Planning were essential to identify the medium and long-term transformations that need to be undertaken on behalf of children and constitute the basis to apply the same approach with remaining key counterparts in 2019. 

UNICEF invested a significant amount of time and resources in producing data, baselines and monitoring systems which will be instrumental to inform programmatic interventions based on evidence and results. Whilst the second round of MICS was the most visible data generation process, there were a number of other processes that contributed to this goal, including surveys and studies on obesity and overweight in children and adolescents and the implementation of the Social Maps developed in 2017. These have been complemented by the creation of baselines and monitoring systems to measure progress in the innovative models such as Families in Action, Child Friendly Municipalities, Civic Centres Without Walls, Music for Children, Listening Classrooms and the Judicial Mentors. In this process, the key lesson was the need to gravitate from a data generation strategy to a more integrated knowledge management methodology. Within this strategy, monitoring and evaluation will be fully integrated into planning, technical counterpart capacities strengthened in knowledge management, data proactively mined and used to inform executive level decisions on child-focused policies and programme, and advocacy, communication and social mobilization are inserted into knowledge management methodologies. This transition, which will be a priority in 2019, should guarantee better and greater advances in the design and impact of policies. 

Investing in a limited number of innovative models within each of the three programme outcomes not only is warranted in a low-resource setting but is instrumental in projecting UNICEF´s greater value-added to its wide range of counterparts. In this regard, the fact that some of these models, such as Casas de la Alegría, Civic Centres Without Walls, Music for Children, Listening Classrooms have either already been officially appropriated by Government or are close to this milestone, confirms that this method of working has been a wise choice. Nevertheless, this does not mean that UNICEF had a clearly specified theory of change to inform the evolution of these models. In other words, it is only at this point that UNICEF has more clearly identified the macro-steps, or the course of events, to take into account in developing models, and that sufficient time needs to be invested at the beginning before embarking on this process. Consequently, this logical work path entails:  
A very clear definition of the problem and whether it represents a situation where important deprivations of child rights are occurring and whose solution would have a direct and positive bearing on the country´s vision for children and its own development goals and aspirations;  
The need to count on government acknowledgment of the problem and an indication that it will actively participate in all stages of the development, implementation and evaluation of the model;  
The commitment to an early systematization to identify preliminary results, lessons learned, pitfalls and the overall potential of the model;  
The importance of investing sufficient resources into national, local and community capacity building on the paradigm shift (use theory of change and results-based management approaches) behind the models, and; 
The need to prioritize the elaboration of guides, protocols, toolkits and monitoring systems to facilitate follow-up on progress, identification of unintended results, development of logical pathways and the consolidation of recommendations regarding different scenarios and options once the model has been confirmed as apt for national scale-up. 

The lack of inter-institutional coordination has long been identified as a structural barrier in Costa Rica in many sectors, including those areas affecting children and adolescents. Although there is wide recognition of this problem, even at the highest level, it does not necessarily nor automatically lead to the will to work together over the setting aside of organizational mandates and responsibilities, many of which are constitutionally enshrined. Notwithstanding this bottleneck, UNICEF has found that as long as a priority has been codified in national and local priorities, for example, in the National Development Plan, the National Agenda and Policy for Children and Adolescents, or in sectoral or thematic policies, the appetite to work together is significantly higher and more conducive to allocation of resources. This has been the case in bringing together MEP, PANI and the CEN-CINAI around the priority to universalize early childhood care for all working mothers irrespective of their economic standing, in the rolling out of Generation Unlimited and in the integrated health model for indigenous women, children and adolescents. In the end, the core lesson is that deep-seated, structural problems affecting children require broader multilateral efforts wherein UNICEF can be an important convener. In the process, a lesson is that bringing institutions out of their comfort zones is a requirement towards breaking artificial silos and barriers. Interestingly, this has challenged UNICEF’s internal responses to guarantee a more unified team wherein annual work plans and the elaboration of direct cash transfers are now negotiated, developed and monitored with the involvement of several programme staff. 

2018 was an important year to achieve greater maturity in positioning participation and social mobilization in the country programme both as process and as strategy. UNICEF has undertaken important efforts to position the situation of children´s rights in the public discourse - particularly through the use of social media - mobilize different sectors of society and promote substantive participation of children and adolescents through the combined strategies of advocacy and communication and focused partnerships with private sector, academia and civil society entities that are also fit for purpose. The key lesson is that this process can be enhanced by guaranteeing three elements. Firstly, there needs to be an effective articulation between knowledge management, social communication, citizenship mobilization and systematic strengthening of the capacities and leadership skills of children and adolescents. Secondly, social mobilization strategies need to be developed through innovative partnerships with civil society, academia, media, the private sector and key influencers, wherein children and adolescents need to be part and equal. Finally, the design, evaluation and scaling up of innovative models of child and adolescent participation should prioritize both mass communication as well as face-to-face strategies. 

Costa Rica exhibits the paradox that a sophisticated normative and legal framework does not necessarily imply fewer violations of children´s rights, and that the positive national indicators are automatically the same at sub-national level, which in many cases are worse. Hence, whilst the normative framework has in overall terms generated a positive quality of life index and improved opportunities for children, UNICEF´s work must be fine-tuned to guarantee that its programmes intelligently combine ¨a head in the boardroom and a foot in the field¨ approach. This requires a number of shifts. Investing in improving and strengthening the normative and legal framework is essential but must be accompanied by focusing on design shortcomings that are at the heart of the inability of existing policies to reach all children and adolescents.  

Equally important is the need to ensure that lessons learned from work at community level reach policy makers, and the converse, that UNICEF use its convening and mobilizing capacities to approximate national level decision-making to local level bodies. Using the example of the successful Integrated Health for Indigenous Women, Children and Adolescents initiative, UNICEF will need to be more present at the local and community level in planning and implementation processes, combined with the delivery of capacity strengthening initiatives. This last point also underscores that the majority of local civil society organizations have great potential as programme implementers but require a high level of capacity building in financial and administrative processes, for which the harmonized approach to cash transfers methodology can be very relevant. 

Even though the UNICEF programme focus in Costa Rica necessitates hard choices in terms of which priority areas will be addressed (a typical challenge working with limited resources in upper middle-income countries where universal social protection schemes have made great strides) this does not exclude contributing in other areas. A case in point is how UNICEF has managed to provide added value in health and nutrition without specialized expertise. This has been achieved by utilising the strong capacities in data generation and knowledge management. This is manifested in the large number of indicators that will be updated in health and nutrition, the support to national surveys and plans of action on childhood obesity and overweight and participating in different governmental working bodies and councils on health and nutrition. 

The number and impact of emergencies in 2018 were not as high as in previous years. However, the migratory crisis in the northern frontier with Nicaragua, generated by the political and economic instability in that country, obligated UNICEF to work outside of its traditional areas and collaborate more closely and in an integrated manner with other UN agencies and in coordination with national authorities. In the process of completing the Emergency Preparedness Platform, an important lesson was the need to establish a minimum threshold of knowledge and capacity across the entire country programme in order to progressively build a team much more fit to respond to emergency situations. This led the country management team to identify as mandatory a number of general and specific online courses to be undertaken by all staff. 

2018 was not without challenges. Although the current Administration is making an effort to lend continuity to the previous one, especially in priority sectors to UNICEF, this has demanded a tremendous amount of time reaching out to new ministers in order to brief them on the country programme and more importantly to secure their commitment to ongoing initiatives. In the process, it has been necessary to negotiate the incorporation of new priorities of the Government which fortunately has not detracted significantly from UNICEF’s programmatic focus and expected results. 

The general education sector strike, which was the longest in the country´s history, not only had an impact on the continuity of classes for thousands of children and adolescents, but led to the necessary rescheduling of activities to 2019 and, in some instances, their outright cancellation. 

UNICEF Costa Rica operates in a resource mobilization environment with very few traditional donors that could help to sustain the programme. In this regard, a reliance on regional thematic funds will continue to be a priority, whilst working with Government counterparts to successfully navigate the ¨funding to financing¨ paradigm shift whereby UNICEF can bring to bear successful experiences in the identification of resource mobilization strategies, especially in education, early childhood development and child protection. 

An important effort has been made to respond to LACRO´s recommendation to reduce risks inherent in issuing a high number of individual and institutional contracts to the detriment of other disbursement mechanisms, principally direct cash transfers (DCTs). This is constraint imposed by the impossibility in Costa Rica of issuing DCTs to government partners. Between 2017 and 2018, the volume of contracts was reduced from 34 per cent to 5 per cent, whereas DCTs increased from 22 per cent to 46 per cent, thus significantly reversing the high percentage of contracts historically issued. 

UNICEF Costa Rica enters 2019 with a very optimistic perspective based on what has largely been a very successful year in achieving important results for children. Baselines have been developed, successful models have been appropriated by Government, annual work plans informed by the theory of change are in place and a new cohort of partners has been incorporated into the country programme. In addition, UNICEF´s digital imprint has never been stronger, thereby guaranteeing that instrumental C4D campaigns will reach a large segment of the population, complemented by an increasing and evolving maturity in the area of child and adolescent development and participation. Likewise, the gender strategy witnessed positive outcomes which will be expanded and solidified in 2019. The lessons learned will be instrumental in the process of fine tuning many processes and improving UNICEF’s ability to take promising models and innovations to scale.

LACR,Cuba,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Lessons learned 

Within the framework of the 2014-2019 Country Programme Document, during the year UNICEF Cuba explored and proved the potential of effectively integrating the C4D change strategy and methodology into results-based programming, considering the particularities of the national context. While community-based entities and spaces are built-into and managed by national and local state institutions, there is a window of opportunity in strengthening the institutional capacities and that of frontline workers to influence behaviour change and ignite social mobilization using an evidence-based approach. 

The lesson learned lies in the discernment of the operative way forward of this integration, where, given the following two complementary elements, the approach proved feasible and so far successful:  
The full support and engagement throughout the process of a national partner institution(s) on a shared priority; 
A shared interest on generation of evidence around an information gap and the articulation of community-based activities through the institutional cross-sectoral spaces at community level.  

These foundations have provided the early childhood development C4D strategy, Father from the Beginning, a promising start and are paving the way for others.

Motivated by the education results area linked to fathers' participation in their children´s early education, the objective of the C4D strategy launched in 2018 is to increase the active participation of fathers during the early years of their children in key health and education spaces. From its onset it identified the community-based early childhood education Educate your Child Programme as its foundation and entry point. Some 68 per cent of Cuban children aged under six years and their families attend this UNICEF-supported programme, led by the National Directorate of Early Childhood of the Ministry of Education. The Cuban model is based on the three essential elements that apply a broad approach of early childhood development: family, community and cross-sectoral synergies. The programme targets parents, relatives and caretakers to improve their parenting skills and foster their active involvement in their children´s education. The original objective of Father from the Beginning was to increase the active participation of fathers in key health spaces (such as family planning, antenatal care, preparation for birth course, birth or postnatal care) with a view to engage fathers from the earliest stages and harness their involvement through early education. 

The long-standing partnership with the National Directorate of Early Childhood was key in convening all the relevant national institutions. They included Ministry of Public Health (National Programme for Maternal and Child Care), Latin American Centre of Reference for Special Education, Masculinities Network, National Union of Jurists, Federation of Cuban Women and the National Centre of Sexual Education. This working group carried out a cross-sectoral desk review to collect existing evidence and initiatives across sectors, and conceptualized the materials and actions designed using the available evidence.

UNICEF Cuba played a leading role in advocating and providing technical assistance to carry out the first comprehensive knowledge, attitudes and practices study on men´s involvement in parenting and domestic care. This generated unprecedented operative evidence on a topic for which there is no reference or national data. A sample of 800 fathers of children attending the Educate Your Child Programme in seven provinces confirmed the generalized lack of knowledge and low participation of fathers around the exercise of their paternity during early childhood. The results shed light on the structural and underlying causes of why only 18 per cent of the Cuban fathers participate in educational activities with their children in their first 36-59 months of life, versus 76 per cent of the mothers (MICS 2014).

The evidence fed into the design of an advocacy tool for national institutions and partners at the highest levels of decision-making, particularly the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Public Health. The potential of the initiative and the information leads sparked further synergies with the National Programme for Maternal and Child Care to revert the poor statistics of an urgent crosscutting national ECD priority - increasing breastfeeding rates. The process therefore organically integrated and contextualized the three pillars of the global Early Moments Campaign: Eat (leveraging fathers support during breastfeeding), Play (harnessing fathers’ unique contribution to their children´s brain development in their first 1,000 days) and Love (introducing awareness about the negative consequences of violence during early childhood and promoting positive parenting). This highlights the potential for improvement of this already conducive national context and enabling environment. The Early Moments Matter report featured Cuba as being among the 15 countries throughout the world that have in place the three most important social policies and programmes to support parents in providing children with the best start in life.

The initiative also provided concluding evidence from the primary audiences to define the contents and approach of the conceptualized C4D materials and actions, ensuring their relevance, effectiveness and the right distribution channels and dissemination spaces. UNICEF Cuba provided important technical assistance to produce the first contextualized and validated mobile application for fathers, linking their interactive tracking of the week-to-week pregnancy process with their demand for antenatal care visits, among others. 

As a best practice, the National Directorate of Early Childhood was involved through the process as a hands-on learning experience. This included being sensitized about the information gap and the value of applying expected results to programming, jointly designing and validating the research instruments and training the programme directors on field data collection to finally validating action and materials. The data was processed and analysed by UNICEF Cuba.

This operative research experience of primary audiences in order to achieve better and more accurate future research results and programme effectiveness measurements revealed two important insights. There is a need to strengthen capacity and motivate the local data collectors directly on the ground, as the inconsistency in the quality and number of surveys per province affected the precision of results for certain questions and integrated indicators. More significantly, given UNICEF Cuba´s role in C4D implementation (such as influencing or stimulating demand and strengthening the institutional capacities), it is important to go beyond research with only primary audiences, and extend to knowledge, attitudes and practices of the secondary audiences. Being the groups with whom UNICEF Cuba will work with, it will be their own knowledge, attitudes and practices that define the results indicators that UNICEF Cuba is accountable for. 

The potential of this C4D implementation model is further endorsed by its potential for scaling up, given the impact and reach of the national state institutions at provincial and local level.
In this particular case, the leadership of the Early Childhood Directorate will have a direct impact on the parents of the 463,393 children involved in the Educate Your Child Programme. The capacity building and sensitization of these frontline workers is being achieved through the training of trainers of the 16 preschool specialists at province level and the 16 directors of the Educate Your Child Programme at province level. Together, they reach the 1,940 early childhood multi-sectoral methodologists and the 2,120 Educate your Child teachers across the country. In parallel, the National Programme for Maternal and Child Care foresees engagement through specific materials and tools of the approximately 10,000 family doctors carrying out primary health care at community level, providing antenatal care and postnatal care across the health institutions where 99.9 per cent of births take place every year (114,000 women).

The feasibility of this approach is reinforced by the conducive media context, where featuring C4D content in the mass media that is in line with national priorities does not necessarily have an added financial cost. Repeatedly claimed as the main source of information and influence across primary audiences regarding several topics, establishing a systematic working relationship with the Cuban Institute of Radio and Television is key to maximizing the impact of C4D strategies in the country.

These lessons are already being applied to other programme areas. An example is in the reduction of overweight and obesity among children in primary school in the province of Cienfuegos, moving forward jointly with the partner institution to obtain the best quality formative data on the basis of agreed result indicators prior to defining and validating actions, or developing materials and tools aimed at teachers and parents.

Other insights from this experience that will be used in programmatic design include the meticulous selection for C4D initiatives through a consultative and advocacy process with the key counterpart. This is a vital factor in the Cuban programmatic environment considering that community-based interventions are led by government institutions and there are implementing partners as traditionally conceived through programme cooperation agreements. Further, it is necessary to ensure that the issue selected with the government counterpart contributes to their overall sector-wide priorities, since they will devote the human resources to collect the data and sensitize families and communities on the issue. This is particularly relevant given that the workload generated by participating in such initiative is additional to their many routine duties as frontline workers, and that it is their enthusiastic and sustained involvement that will provide the long-term behavioural change results on the ground.

"
LACR,Dominican Republic,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
2018 was the first year of the Country Programme 2018-2022 and, so far, the theory of change of each programme component are in their initial stages. However, several lessons have been learned in this period. 

The first lesson learned is related to the Children Survive and Thrive programme component. The conclusions of the evaluation of the Mothers and Babies in Good Care initiative were that: 
It increased the level of compliance with quality standards of maternal and neonatal care; 
Maternal and neonatal deaths were reduced (the maternal deaths have not been reduced in the hospital with a lower level of compliance with quality standards), and; 
The initiative could be scaled-up to public policy, given some recommendations to do so, such as the need to increase the appropriation of the Initiative by the National Health Service. 

UNICEF did not have the financial and staff resources to follow up on all the evaluation recommendations and to continue with the 2018 planning and, as a result, it was necessary to select one option. 

UNICEF analysed the advantages, disadvantages and risks, and specifically the local environment at the current time. Taking into consideration the greater receptiveness of the current management of the NHS and of the MoH, UNICEF modified its strategy to implement the initiative directly in hospitals and developed an intensive plan of evidence-based advocacy and technical assistance focused on strengthening the NHS ownership of the initiative.  

In November, the NHS decided to incorporate the initiative´s methodology as the main strategy to improve the quality of maternal and neonatal care in the 20 most important public hospitals and is leveraging its own resources for hiring new personnel for its implementation. To this end, UNICEF will focus its efforts and resources on strong technical support for the NHS to break the resistance to change among health staff and in the institutional culture. If this process is successful, UNICEF will have made an important contribution to reducing maternal and neonatal mortality in the country. 

The lessons learned were not only about the value of the evaluation, but also the importance of carefully analysing the changing environment to choose the optimum moment to put all the efforts into a strategic intervention. In addition, the importance of UNICEF maintaining an adaptive and flexible approach was highlighted, being able to change from the original plan of working in some hospitals to an institutional programme.Based on the conclusions of the evaluation, in 2019 UNICEF will focus its efforts on transferring the methodology to NHS. 

The second area of work where key lesson were learned relates to the KAP study into child marriage and early unions. The preliminary results showed that the gender roles on which this practice is based were deeper and more ingrained than were expected. Some 93 per cent of the people interviewed agreed that the main role of every woman is to be a good wife and mother. This opinion was similar among all age and sex groups. This attitude, and the early economic emancipation expected for young people of both sexes, leads many girl adolescents almost inexorably to child marriage and early unions, despite their knowledge of the negative consequences, as shown in the research. 

According to this research, child marriage and early unions is not a problem of lack of knowledge that can be resolved only with information or sensitization. The strategies to prevent child marriage should also include the promotion of changes in attitudes, practices and behaviours to overcome these roles assigned to young women. 

Another lesson learned has been that, despite having had several previous studies on the subject, only an in-depth KAP study allowed UNICEF to assess the magnitude of the problems that the programme is going to face, and to make the necessary reflections to adapt the intervention. 

Although it is still too early to know if the theory of change is still valid, the depth and the rooting of these perceptions will lead UNICEF to carry out in 2019 a new analysis of the theory of change, the strategies and especially the results that can be expected in the short term in this complex context.Likewise, there remains the challenge of being able to identify process indicators that can measure these advances.

Limitations and challenges 

During the year, the Country Programme faced some limitations and challenges. 

The situation of instability in Haiti, as already highlightedaffected the development of UNICEF's programme, leading to the suspension several times of bi-national meetings to strengthen the child protection systems of both countries. These meetings were organized jointly with UNICEF Haiti, local institutions and NGOs on both sides of the border.  

The Attorney-General’s Office had several staff changes, including the specialized prosecutors for Human Trafficking and High-tech Crimes, which caused implementation delays and changes in the development of key activities. To address this constraint, UNICEF reinforced its direct technical assistance and monitoring of the activities.  

UNICEF implemented the preparation activities for the National Household Survey-MICS 2019, with the National Statistics Office (NSO). This process had three important challenges: 
The insufficient funds available (one-third of the total budget), 
The National Health Survey will not be repeated in the country, and; 
The NSO is still collecting the data survey on paper.  

In response, and together with UNFPA, UNICEF undertook intensive advocacy with the Ministry of Economy, Planning and Development. As a consequence, the total budget needed was allocated and a plan to collect the National Health Survey data for several years was accepted, including some questions in MICS 2019. With support from UNICEF headquarters and Latin America and Caribbean Regional Office, the NSO accepted the collection of data with tablets. 

The recruitment of national staff for new components of the country programme, the resignation of several national staff arising from change of country residence or retirement, and the rotation of some the international staff, resulted in major transformations in the personnel structure. In total, 54 per cent of the current staff were recruited or assigned to new functions in 2018. To reduce the impact of this constraint, important efforts were made in the induction of the new staff, not only from the technical point of view and about the administrative norms and requirements of the organization, but also specifically on the Standards of Conduct. Special attention was given to all the staff in relation to the Speak-up Culture, to the prevention of sexual harassment and abuse of authority, and to the mechanisms for reporting. Despite this constraint, 100 per cent of the allocated funds were implemented.

Cross-cutting strategies  

UNICEF implemented a number of cross-cutting strategies during the year, as follow. 

Institutional strengthening of national systems 
This was undertaken mainly in the programmes that were developed during the previous country programme. In 2018, the MoE started the first steps to scale-up the new model for teaching reading, writing and mathematics in the first years of primary school. The Civil Registry service was strengthened, through an inter-institutional high-level agreement, that was implemented in the 21 most important hospitals of the country with remarkable success. 

Important steps were taken in the strengthening of the NHS through the first phase of the process of transferring the methodology of the Mothers and Babies in Good Care initiative. All these initiatives were promoted by UNICEF. Jointly with other UN agencies and civil society organizations, UNICEF advocated for the legal prohibition of child marriage. 

Policy engagement 
With the evidence of UNICEF and the World Bank, a communication campaign and intensive advocacy, UNICEF obtained the political commitment of the Vice President, on whom the social protection programmes depend, and of the MoE to prevent child marriage. In 2018, an educative video for working on prevention of child marriage and early union in schools was produced by UNICEF. The child marriage KAP study was undertaken with the social protection programme.  

Multisectoral programming 
This was mainly in early childhood development, in birth registration through the inter-institutional high-level agreement, in the prevention of violence against children through the inter-institutional National Roadmap, and in preventing sexual exploitation through the inter-sectoral agreement which focus on five tourist municipalities. All this cross-sectoral work was facilitated by UNICEF. 

Social and behavioural change 
This strategy was mainly applied in child marriage and early unions. In 2018, UNICEF implemented a KAP study in six communities, the conclusions of which will be the basis for a pilot initiative to eradicate child marriage, based on a communication for development (C4D) strategy. The Zika response not only included communication for development as a programme strategy, but also promoted the incorporation of UNICEF’s C4D model into the MoH’s national training and guidelines for health promotion and disease prevention. In ECD, UNICEF promoted behavioural change in positive parenting, hygiene and nurturing care.  

Communication and advocacy 
The focused communication and advocacy strategy to win the support for the cause of children and young people strengthened UNICEF’s leadership voice by increasing the number of mentions in top-tier media by 36 per cent (1,525 mentions). Digital presence was strong, reaching 15.5 million people and the engagement with audiences increased by 51.9 per cent. The number of followers increased by 15 per cent compared to 2017. A total number of 363,261 users visited the website, exceeding the established goal. 

Strategic partnerships for advocacy and public engagement were built with 16 influencers (who have a combined audience of 5.8 million followers) who delivered key messages on priority issues like child marriage, sexual exploitation of children, ending violence in schools, ECD and for World Children’s Day. UNICEF engaged a 17-year-old influencer to help support young people to become agents of change. The influencer hosted a youth talk with 400 adolescents on ending violence in schools.  

Partnerships with the private sector 
UNICEF has a Business Advisory Council formed by entrepreneurs that supported advocacy for child rights and generated new opportunities for corporate engagement.  

In ECD, the Super Dads campaign promoted the importance of the role of fathers in early childhood. In health, more breastfeeding rooms were built for employees and, in 2018, also for clients.  

In the prevention of sexual exploitation, seven new hotels and the Hotel Association of Santo Domingo joined The Code of Conduct for the Protection of Children from Sexual Exploitation in Travel and Tourism, bringing the total to 69. AERODOM displayed banners at the main airports to inform tourists that sexual exploitation is a crime pursued in the country.  

In a child-responsive urban setting a Children´s Rights Impact Assessment was undertaken in an affordable housing development. The study´s recommendations will be included by the investor in the development of future housing complexes in Latin America.  

The fundraising from of the local private sector finances UNICEF-supported health and child protection activities.  

Harnessing the power of evidence as a driver of change for children 
This key strategy was used in:  
The evaluation of the health initiative in two hospitals on Mothers and Babies in Good Care. Based on the conclusions, UNICEF developed a plan of evidence-based advocacy focused on strengthening the NHS ownership of the initiative; 
The UNICEF Children Out of School study which supported the implementation of a new pedagogical model to teach reading, writing and mathematics in the first and second grades; 
The timely Birth Registration Baseline which is being used to monitor the results of the measures taken by the partners of the Inter-Institutional Agreement to Universalize the Birth Registry; 
The KAP study on Child Marriage will be the basis for a new pilot programme to prevent child marriage; 
The Child Rights Impact Assessment on an affordable housing development will be used by the investor to improve child rights in similar developments both in the Dominican Republic and in other countries, and; 
The conclusions of the evaluation on Zika response will support the dialogue with the government promoting the development of a more inclusive and comprehensive policy for children with disabilities.

LACR,Ecuador,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Como seguimiento a las recomendaciones emitidas por el Comité de Derechos del Niño al Estado de Ecuador en septiembre de 2017, los Miembros Expertos del Comité, José Ángel Rodríguez y Luis Pedernera, visitaron Ecuador del 11 al 15 de diciembre de 2018 El objetivo de la misión fue prestar asistencia técnica para el establecimiento de un mecanismo de seguimiento de las recomendaciones, así como resaltar algunas de las recomendaciones más importantes. La visita incluyó reuniones sustantivas con la entonces vicepresidente de Ecuador, los ministros del Sector Social, la Asamblea Nacional, la Corte Constitucional, la Corte Nacional de Justicia, el Consejo de la Judicatura, las organizaciones de la sociedad civil, la academia y una delegación de adolescentes de varias regiones del país. La misión tuvo una amplia cobertura de los principales medios de televisión, radio y prensa.
Los miembros del Comité compartieron sus argumentos sobre las principales preocupaciones en materia de niñez y adolescencia en Ecuador con las altas autoridades, en particular sobre la pérdida de especialización debido al enfoque intergeneracional, la ausencia de un sistema de protección especializada para responder al abuso sexual contra niños, y la necesidad de asignar presupuesto específico y recopilar datos desagregados por edad, etnia, género y zona geográfica.

Los principales resultados de la misión de los expertos incluyen un claro compromiso del Gobierno de establecer un mecanismo de seguimiento de alto nivel a las recomendaciones del Comité, la ratificación del Tercer Protocolo que tuvo lugar en junio de 2018, la realización de un seminario internacional sobre legislación que responde efectivamente el interés superior y la especialización dentro del enfoque intergeneracional. Adicional a ello, y como seguimiento a las recomendaciones del seminario internacional, la Asamblea Nacional creó la Comisión Ocasional de Niñez y Adolescencia para revisar todo proyecto legislativo en materia de niñez y adolescencia.
La interacción oportuna y cercana con el Comité de los derechos del Niño ha demostrado ser una herramienta de abogacía efectiva ante las autoridades nacionales. UNICEF presentó el informe confidencial y las respuestas a la Lista de cuestiones previa, asistió a la pre-sesión en febrero 2017 y defensa del informe en septiembre en Ginebra y promueve el establecimiento de un mecanismo de seguimiento de las recomendaciones del Comité. Este involucramiento ha permitido posicionar las principales preocupaciones sobre la niñez y adolescencia en la agenda de las altas autoridades y en el debate público y promover la coordinación interinstitucional para la garantía de los derechos de la niñez y adolescencia en Ecuador.

Adicional a ello, en el área de comunicaciones, UNICEF continuó posicionando temas de niñez y adolescencia en la agenda nacional, debido a que la organización goza de una alta credibilidad y reputación en el Ecuador. Según el estudio Latino Barómetro 2018, UNICEF es la organización con mayor confianza en el país, y de acuerdo con el estudio realizado por IPSOS sobre la imagen de organismos internacionales en América Latina, el 87% de líderes de opinión y periodistas consideran que UNICEF tiene un impacto positivo en el Ecuador. En 2018, 11 millones y medio de personas fueron alcanzadas con mensajes producidos por UNICEF Ecuador a través de medios de comunicación y tiene una comunidad de seguidores consolidada en redes sociales de más de 120.000 seguidores. 

UNICEF Ecuador obtuvo el premio a la “Mejor Campaña Integrada” de los Inspire Awards, y recibió un reconocimiento en el High Level Forum por su campaña contra el abuso sexual #AhoraQueLoVes #DiNoMás. La campaña continúo implementándose en 2018 en coordinación con el Ministerio de Educación, con las fases Súper Padres y Súper Profes, y siguió involucrando a celebridades y periodistas reconocidos. En una encuesta realizada a más de 1.200 docentes, casi el 50% sostuvo que la campaña contribuyó de manera directa en el incremento del número de denuncias de abuso sexual, un 41% consideró que los videos influenciaron parcialmente. Solo un 11% opinó que no había un impacto relacionado.

En 2018, en el marco de la campaña global #Uprooted, UNICEF Ecuador visibilizó la situación de los niños venezolanos y sus necesidades a través de historias de vida difundidas en redes sociales a nivel país, regional y global utilizando el hashtag #AnteTodoSonNiños y contribuyó significativamente al diseño de la campaña anti xenofóbica del Sistema de las Naciones Unidas a ser lanzada a principios de 2019. 

La crisis económica que afecta a Ecuador se ha convertido en una limitante para alcanzar las metas de recaudación previstas. La recaudación de fondos privados (PFP) alcanzó los US$ 5,58 millones en 2018, con un decrecimiento equivalente al -4.3% en comparación con los resultados del año 2017. En este año, los factores internos y externos que han tenido una repercusión negativa en el desempeño económico del país y de las familias del Ecuador han afectado también a la recaudación de fondos privados de UNICEF. El canal de donantes individuales continúa siendo el de mayor relevancia, pues el contexto económico del país también ha afectado al sector empresarial los que se traduce en una menor probabilidad de que el sector corporativo realice contribuciones económicas a UNICEF Ecuador a menos que la oficina rediseñe sus estrategias de aproximación con ellos, esfuerzo que se está realizando tanto con el apoyo de PFP LACRO como HQ. Entre los planes por diversificar donantes, se piensa incrementar el número de Facers a través de un convenio con la oficina de Voluntarios de las Naciones Unidas (VNU), la realización de un teletón, y acercamiento con el sector empresarial con una estrategia de identificación de temas de interés común que permita alcanzar modalidades innovadoras de implementación y financiación. 
A pesar de lo anterior, las iniciativas locales para la movilización de recursos tuvieron un resultado positivo en el reclutamiento de nuevos donantes individuales a través de las estrategias digital, telemarketing y face to face. Sin embargo, el contexto general del país se tradujo también en una reducción de los donantes existentes, lo cual dio como resultado neto una caída del número de donantes individuales de -7.5% al pasar de 56.028 en 2017 a 51.800 en 2018, con un monto total recaudado en 2018 en este canal de US$ 5,.32 millones. 

Adicionalmente, a través del sector corporativo fue posible generar un ingreso en 2018 equivalente a US$ 0,26 millones, de los cuales el 22,5% fueron contribuciones en especies valoradas en US$ 0,06 millones. En total, las gestiones realizadas se tradujeron en un monto recaudado de US$ 5,58 millones aportado por el sector privado.

Finalmente, la crisis de movilidad humana demandó el incremento de la estructura de la oficina en 19%. La respuesta inmediata se ejecutó por medio de contratistas individuales en la zona fronteriza. Se realizó un trabajo conjunto con UNV en la contratación de voluntarios para la respuesta en terreno en las áreas de protección, WASH, salud y nutrición. Se recibieron fondos de LACRO para contratación de posiciones temporales para las áreas de Protección en Tulcán y WASH en Quito, así como para las extensiones de contratos relacionados con emergencia para el 2019. Se crearon canales de comunicación con la oficina regional para la gestión de los fondos relacionados con recursos humanos, procesos de reclutamiento en emergencia y reporte de acciones a HQ. Finalmente se registró un balance de tiempo de trabajo extra para su compensación al equipo con el fin de equilibrar el esfuerzo adicional desplegado en respuesta a la crisis. La contratación de Voluntarios de las Naciones Unidas con especialidad en protección de la niñez, educación y salud, ha demostrado ser una experiencia positiva que permite contar con personas altamente calificadas y con espíritu de voluntariado, facilitando los procesos de aprendizaje y contribuyendo efectivamente a alcanzar los resultados propuestos

En respuesta a la crisis migratoria venezolana, en el área de suministros se incrementó la cantidad de contrataciones de servicios e insumos. Durante el 2018 se realizaron 70 procesos de contratación de servicios por el valor de USD 1.669.584,87 y 14 órdenes de compra de insumos por el valor de USD 292.458,95. Esto se ha hecho si incrementar personal de operaciones y deja como aprendizaje la necesidad de, en emergencias, incrementar equitativamente el soporte a programas para evitar posibles cuellos de botella





"
LACR,El Salvador,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"2018 ha estado marcado por ser un año de elecciones legislativas y municipales, y por el inicio de la campaña electoral presidencial. UNICEF ha sabido aprovechar la coyuntura que nos brindan las próximas elecciones presidenciales en febrero de 2019, para posicionar en la agenda de los candidatos temas prioritarios, como el desarrollo de la primera infancia, o el aumento de la inversión en la niñez.

Para poder incidir en los candidatos electorales, medios de comunicación, bancos de desarrollo, y sector privado, ha sido decisivo hacer alianzas con centros de excelencia líderes mundiales como el centro Global TIES for Children de la Universidad de Nueva York, y contar con el apoyo de expertos internacionales de reconocido prestigio para poder elaborar propuestas solventes y creíbles fundadas en evidencia empírica y científica robusta como la propuesta “Invertir en nuestros niños: el norte común”, la cual fue lanzada por UNICEF en septiembre. Esta propuesta también ha tenido alta aceptación además de por su alto nivel técnico, por que incluye intervenciones concretas, costeadas y con una estrategia de implementación. Un factor de éxito para acceder a espacios y foros no habituales para UNICEF ha sido el haber trabajado con el Consejo Consultivo de la Niñez, que está formado por un grupo de personas de alto prestigio, representativas de diversos ámbitos de la sociedad salvadoreña que incluyen sector privado, sociedad civil o/y universidades. El Consejo ha abierto a UNICEF El Salvador las puertas para poder hacer alianzas exitosas que han contribuido a la difusión y adopción de la propuesta, por ejemplo, con gremiales del sector privado como ANEP, medios de comunicación, o grupos de jóvenes líderes como Global Shapers. Los principales actores políticos, instituciones públicas, bancos de desarrollo y sector privado se han comprometido públicamente a apoyar su implementación, han adoptado los mensajes clave, y han abierto espacios a los que UNICEF todavía no había accedido. Representantes de las 4 fórmulas presidenciales que competirán en las elecciones de febrero 2019 asistieron al evento de lanzamiento de la propuesta, sostuvieron reuniones de trabajo con expertos y especialistas invitados por UNICEF y se comprometieron, de manera pública, a aumentar la cantidad y calidad de la inversión en la primera infancia. Debido al alto interés suscitado, esta propuesta está s
iendo utilizada como base para la elaboración de un programa para el desarrollo de la primera infancia conjuntamente con el BID y el BM que será lanzado durante el 2019. 

UNICEF ha continuado apostando por apoyar y promover espacios de diálogo nacional como el Consejo Nacional de Educación (CONED), pese a la dificultad de obtener resultados a corto plazo. UNICEF El Salvador es la secretaria del CONED, lo cual posiciona la oficina en un lugar privilegiado para mantener este espacio de diálogo como plataforma idónea para lograr apoyos y consensos en materia de política educativa. Además, a través de estos consejos, los principales candidatos a la vicepresidencia en las próximas elecciones se han comprometido públicamente a continuar la implementación del Plan El Salvador Educado y o El Plan El Salvador Seguro. A través de estos consejos es posible posicionar las principales políticas sociales y prioridades de UNICEF en la agenda política del país, generar alianzas y respaldos que garanticen la continuidad del trabajo conjunto tras el cambio en la administración gubernamental. 

La situación de violencia crónica que experimenta El Salvador dificulta establecer una frontera entre las intervenciones de desarrollo y de respuesta humanitaria, requiriendo la adopción de nuevas formas de trabajar (New Way of Working) tanto para UNICEF, como para las agencias del Sistema de Naciones Unidas y los socios de UNICEF, ya que en muchos casos es necesario al mismo tiempo fortalecer la resiliencia de las personas afectadas, y proporcionar asistencia humanitaria. El Salvador sufre niveles de violencia similares a países en conflicto armado, aunque no está considerado como un país en emergencia. Estas formas de violencia crónica afectan especialmente a los adolescentes – a través de homicidios o reclutamiento por las maras desde tempranas edades- y a las adolescentes a través de la violencia sexual. Este fenómeno es una de las principales causas para el abandono escolar, el desplazamiento y la migración, o el no acceso a servicios públicos. 

Esta situación de violencia provoca altos niveles de inseguridad ciudadana que pueden limitar el acceso a comunidades donde hay control territorial por parte de las maras. 

Para responder a la alerta nacional por el alto número de feminicidios decretada por el Gobierno de El Salvador en 2018, se favoreció a través de la iniciativa Spotlight la articulación entre el Consejo Nacional de la Niñez y Adolescencia (CONNA) y el Instituto Salvadoreño para el Desarrollo de la Mujer (ISDEMU), para asegurar que ambas instituciones rectoras participasen en el diseño del programa Spotlight. Además, ambas instituciones han participado en la elaboración de la estrategia de erradicación de la violencia sexual asegurando la inclusión de las niñas, reconociendo que las mujeres experimentan la violencia en forma de continuum, es decir que acumulan diversas agresiones y hechos a lo largo del ciclo de vida, que con frecuencia culminan en el feminicidio.

Es necesario también continuar promoviendo la coordinación multisectorial. Un ejemplo es la necesidad de abordar los factores de riesgo relacionados al virus Zika durante la etapa materno-infantil desde un enfoque integral. Esta experiencia ha realzado la necesidad de impulsar un modelo que garantice la intersectorialidad en la atención integral de niñas y niños con anomalías congénitas y discapacidad. Además, ha permitido posicionar el cuidado infantil y el apoyo familiar como un área estratégica de trabajo para salud y educación durante la maternidad, primera infancia y niñez.
Otra importante lección aprendida es que el trabajo previo y coordinado con las instituciones públicas ha contribuido a dar una respuesta ágil en situaciones imprevistas y/o de crisis. Ante la solicitud de apoyo al SNU por parte del gobierno debido a la salida de caravanas de migrantes rumbo a Estados Unidos en noviembre de 2018, UNICEF El Salvador, contaba con materiales de comunicación sobre niños y niñas migrantes y con las alianzas estratégicas adecuadas como la Dirección General de Migración y Extranjería (DGME) y las instituciones encargadas de la protección de niños y niñas en el país (CONNA y el ISNA). Todo lo anterior permitió la rápida distribución de 60,000 panfletos a familias en las caravanas y personas en riesgo de migrar. Además, con la DGME se habían diseñado kits con suministros básicos de higiene y alimentarios específicos de acuerdo con edades y sexo, lo cual facilitó y agilizó la compra y distribución a los niños y niñas retornados. 

A año y medio de su implementación, U-Report El Salvador ha reportado un estancamiento en cuanto al crecimiento de la comunidad de U-Reporters y una reducción considerable de porcentaje de respuesta (de 98% a 18%). Esta reducción se debe entre ellos a la suspensión de la plataforma Twitter para afiliarse a U-Report, el cual afecto a más de 250 U-Reporters en El Salvador, a las dificultades enfrentadas por los adolescentes y jóvenes de escasos recursos para tener acceso continuo al internet, así como los desafíos para mantener activo y comprometido al Comité Interinstitucional U-Report. En 2018, los socios implementadores del proyecto Zika promocionaron la plataforma U-Report en centros escolares de sus áreas de intervención; sin embargo, se encontraron con diversos factores que dificultaron el registro masivo de nuevos adolescentes, en particular la mala conexión a internet. 

Para finalizar, resulta prioritario consolidar el monitoreo y la evaluación como prácticas permanentes en la gestión del conocimiento, que sirvan de eje orientador para la formulación de políticas públicas basadas en evidencia y la planificación e implementación de los programas impulsados por la Oficina de UNICEF en El Salvador, de la mano con sus contrapartes. Esto permitiría brindar una atención oportuna y de calidad a los niños, niñas y adolescentes, adecuada a sus necesidades. Actualmente, la información producida por las instituciones que trabajan en pro de la infancia se encuentra fragmentada, ya que carecen de sistemas integrados que permitan el monitoreo constante de indicadores clave. Asimismo, los datos disponibles cuentan con bajos niveles de desagregación que no permiten comprender los problemas que afectan a esta población, no siempre están actualizados y existen pocas series temporales que permitan realizar análisis de tendencias.




"
LACR,Guatemala,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Una lección aprendida es la importancia del trabajo a nivel municipal y comunitario. Experiencias exitosas como el Saneamiento Total Liderado por la Comunidad (SANTOLIC), los videos comunitarios para la mejora de prácticas de higiene para la prevención de la desnutrición crónica y las Oficinas Municipales de Protección, han sido diseñadas e implementadas desde el ámbito local, lo cual ha favorecido su apropiación por parte de las comunidades, la continuidad de sus operaciones y su expansión a más territorios. UNICEF y Helvetas elaboraron un documento de lecciones aprendidas y existe también una evaluación externa del trabajo de la estrategia de UNICEF en el ámbito de protección de la infancia. Este confirmó la pertinencia de descentralizar las intervenciones a nivel municipal para mejorar el acceso a servicios de protección especial y sentar las bases de un sistema comunitario de protección.

El trabajo realizado mediante la estrategia de Comunicación para el Desarrollo y su impacto para el cambio de comportamientos, creencias y prácticas también ha mostrado ser eficaz para la mejora de situación de la niñez y adolescencia en distintos ámbitos, como la salud, nutrición, agua y saneamiento y protección. Debido a sus efectos positivos, UNICEF ha utilizado cada vez más esta estrategia la cual, además, ha generado mayor demanda de las comunidades para la adecuada prestación de servicios públicos esenciales. 

Una lección aprendida destacable en el ámbito del trabajo inter agencial es que hay formas simples, novedosas y efectivas de articular y coordinar esfuerzos, como por ejemplo, mediante la contratación de consultores compartidos para apoyar la implementación del Plan Nacional de Prevención de Embarazos en Adolescentes, entre UNICEF, UNFPA y OPS/OMS.
También se destaca la coordinación inter agencial entre UNICEF y FAO para apoyar el restablecimiento del sistema alimentario y fortalecer la resiliencia de las familias afectadas por la canícula prolongada en el Corredor Seco.

En el contexto volátil y complejo que vivió el país, hubo estrategias que funcionaron bien y algunas restricciones que no permitieron avanzar mucho hacia las metas del Programa.

La respuesta de UNICEF y de clústeres ante la emergencia del Volcán de Fuego funcionaron bien y fue iniciado el proceso de contratación de una empresa para sistematizarla. La respuesta a las Caravanas de Migrantes fue bien recibida. UNICEF desempeñó un sólido rol en todos los clústeres pertinentes y sigue en condiciones de apoyar los nuevos flujos migratorios con sus aliados.

Es de destacar el uso de U-Report como mecanismo de comunicación con los jóvenes durante la emergencia del Volcán de Fuego.
Una de las mayores restricciones del año fue el escaso avance en la protección especial de la infancia, particularmente en los procesos de desinstitucionalización y la aprobación de una nueva Ley de Protección de la Niñez y Adolescencia.

Los buenos resultados obtenidos al trabajar con las familias, las comunidades y las municipalidades, y las ONGs, muestran que las estrategias que parten desde lo local deben continuarse y fortalecerse. 
Asimismo, las intervenciones realizadas confirman la importancia de reforzar el trabajo inter sectorial, coordinación y coherencia entre las políticas, programas y servicios a nivel nacional y local.

Dada la alta vulnerabilidad del país ante eventos naturales y riesgo de emergencias (sexto a nivel mundial), además de los efectos del cambio climático, la volatilidad de la región y los flujos migratorios, se debe considerar la posibilidad de tener un personal dedicado exclusivamente a estos temas en el próximo período de cooperación. 

En el contexto de crisis, emergencias y lentos avances en la mayoría de los indicadores sociales de la niñez, demuestran claramente le necesidad de invertir fuertemente en la innovación en políticas y programas, y utilizar las nuevas tecnologías para alcanzar más resultados, costo efectivo y a escala. 




"
LACR,Guyana,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Several lessons were learned and challenges were encountered in 2018. The year demonstrated that the theories of change which were conceptualized in 2017 are truly ‘living documents’ and although there is a need to adhere to the planned agenda, there are opportunistic moments for driving children’s rights and gaining traction for issues at the highest levels. For Guyana, this was demonstrated through UNICEF’s engagement on the reform of and the elaboration of several recommendations on how children’s rights can be deeply entrenched in the highest law of the land- the Constitution.  

Additionally, while discussions related to child labour from a protection lens had not been the traditional focus of UNICEF’s work, with strong partnerships and based on the need to ensure that the full range of violence and exploitation issues are revised in the enabling environment, in both Guyana and Suriname, UNICEF influenced both legislative and policy reform. 

More realistic planning, capacity building in interpreting data and preparing adequate responses, and institutional strengthening, especially for succession planning, will become priorities in 2019 and beyond.

The investment in cross-cutting strategies proved successful to foster programme coherence, communication and advocacy directed towards rights holders and duty bearers. The strong presence, including in the field, of UNICEF and the readiness of partners to provide technical and other support also proved effective in the identification of an integrated multi-sectoral package of interventions to address overlapped deprivations and geographic disparities while promoting convergence across sectors and improved approaches to programme monitoring (Level 3 monitoring). The community involvement and having them on board is key for the success of on-the-ground interventions.  

In child protection, it was evidence that for interventions to be successful, all key  ministries, must be on board and participate actively, due to its cross cutting nature. The commitment from the highest level of policy makers down to community members is needed to fight violence against children. Changing beliefs and behaviours regarding the use of violence needs a careful approach and takes time. Ensuring sufficient quantity and quality of implementing partner’s staff is an additional lesson learned, as was keeping stakeholders informed at all stages of a programme being a key element to success and creating ownership. 

With MICS (real-time data collection), the efficiency gains allow the media to be timely and extensively informed during all critical milestones. This proved to be essential in getting a desirable response of households and interest in the survey results. In Suriname, the reform of the Government’s monitoring team (Planning Bureau) on the coordination of the MSDF/CIP slightly slowed down the process. At the same time, the minimal number of Results Group meetings called by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs impacted on coordination and joint efforts for achieving common goals.

In the social policy front, the need for reform in social protection system, emergencies and engagement with the extractive industries became evident. UNICEF will continue to advance efforts for partnering with relevant actors – public and private sector. UNICEF is part of a multi-country support initiative led by the UNICEF Regional Office’s Private Fundraising and Partnerships team to assist in mapping the best entry points for a win-win situation.  

UNICEF in Guyana and Suriname managed to use its resources in a cost-effective way, nevertheless, more strategic partnerships and leveraging funding opportunities are needed to support the effective realization of results for children considering the findings from research and the momentum created by new laws, such as the Juvenile Justice Act, 2018. 

Lessons learned 

Major lessons learned throughout the year and programmes centred on the following.

Programme scaling-up 
For all interventions and to address issues relating to equity and gender, there is a need to accelerate initial investments to move to scale. This includes the use of both cross-sectoral programmes and continuing to invest in cross-cutting strategies, support for additional funding and influencing the national budget for children’s rights 

PRIME and evaluation 
The research that informs and influences the policy discourse, debate and advocacy on child rights, well-being and development was helpful in 2018 to identify key activities that strengthen the capacity for evidence generation and use within UNICEF and among partner organizations. The partnerships, the networks and strategic alliances established through the office management helped to improve the generation and use of knowledge and child’s evidence by the countries’ decision-makers. The key constraints on the PRIME 2018 was the matching between the evaluation design and the resources to support the action plans to address the bottlenecks, as well as the timeline to optimize use of evaluations recommendations in the same year. 

Social policy 
In 2018, in Suriname, UNICEF committed to and worked on equity for children, focused on overcoming multiple deprivations faced by children. To improve knowledge about children, it is necessary to have a method for the measurement of multidimensional poverty. Work on this was initiated, and the result will provide baseline measures for the establishment of the national social policy programme and for analysing progress towards SDG 1: end poverty in all its forms everywhere, especially for the most deprived children in Guyana and Suriname.

Digital technologies 
The 2018 annual work plan communication activities showed that digital technologies can play a key role in adolescent knowledge improvement. However, evidence needs to be generated on the children’s online experiences, examining both opportunities and risks of digital use. In the context of Guyana and Suriname, through UNICEF’s external relations and communication activities organized with adolescent participation it was learned that digital technologies can improve literacy, promote positive behaviour change, support curriculum development and training of teachers, and sharing of knowledge. However, for effectiveness, the digital technologies approach needs to be supported by policy development as well as a comprehensive youth and adolescent communication and outreach campaign.

Humanitarian response in a development context 
The April 2018 flood response in Sipaliwini region enabled UNICEF to innovate in the humanitarian WASH response by integrating the WASH-education-health partnership with the full participation of local populations. The focus was on: (1) targeting of the most poor and vulnerable children; (2) engagement of families; (3) use of community-based platforms to provide services, and (4) definition of standards. This convergent approach through a single implementing partner (Medical Mission) provided good value for money.  

Data and evidence generation 
The 2018 studies undertaken, including on the drivers of violence affecting children, demonstrated a need to ensure that advocacy is better-informed, while at the same time underscoring the need for more investments in the sector. 

A need was identified to set up intersectoral plans and models on strengthening parenting of adolescents (including peer-to-peer approaches) and the financing of these plans in the short, medium and long term. 

The use of bottom-up participatory approaches to planning and monitoring was practiced. Although time consuming, this strategy created space for good conceptualization and ownership, respect for process - highly valued by the MoE - and active engagement by mixed adult, child and adolescent groups. This was evident in the positive discipline strategy where development of user-friendly monitoring tools with and for all beneficiaries, including parents and children, proved to be the accelerators in the process. Additionally, children’s creative conflict resolution activities were identified as a measure of sustainability. 

Partnerships 
The partnerships with private sector organizations, while adhering to due diligence principles, enabled UNICEF to open new advocacy opportunities for the financing of the extension of basic social services by companies in favour of children. This included engagement with extractive industries and mobile network operators to set-up an SMS-based platform to allow for real-time monitoring (U-Report). However, the formalization of this collaboration through partnership documents based on the Child Rights and Business Principles and performance financing for children are key to the success of this mode of collaboration in the long term, in a changing economic context.

Gender equality 
UNICEF systematically included the gender dimension in studies, research and evaluative exercises to ensure evidence and results were gender-differentiated. Regarding capacity of implementing partners, the levels of disaggregation of data are very low. To ensure partner’s interventions are more gender-responsive, it is important for UNICEF to provide technical assistance to identify gender considerations and developing a gender-responsive implementation strategies or plans. These should promote women’s engagement and empowerment, enhance gender equality, and incorporate activities and processes to address relevant gender issues in work programmes at the country-level. 

Constraints 

The remaining constraints can be addressed as follows.

High turnover of human resources 
The availability of staff in line ministries has proven to be an issue, affecting the implementation rate. For instance, constraints in the education sector in Suriname with a high turnover at the strategic level have slowed down some commitments, and interventions have been carried over to 2019. UNICEF will continue to advocate for the finalization of the education sector plan (through approval of the new Education Act), which ensures expansion of compulsory education from 4-16 years from 7-12 years. UNICEF will also support the Ministry of Youth/Sports in the development of their strategic plan for the coming years, ensuring clarity on their role and responsibilities.

National budgets 
The 2018 allocations for some specific plans in Suriname proved to be a bottleneck for ensuring continuation of essential basic health care and support to mothers and for the continuation of programmes critical for the health of infants. This resulted in UNICEF having to provide additional support. This impacted on the planned long-term policy intervention with the Government in the health sector. UNICEF will continue to advocate for the allocation of sufficient funding for ensuring basic health care for mothers and young children.

Hard-to-reach populations and equity 
Logistics by road, boat and air in the interior proved challenging, especially the changing river tide. These aspects need to be taken into consideration when planning programmes and meeting the equity agenda. Clear communication on why some specific villages were selected or given priority for support is key to avoid any misunderstanding. In Suriname, the traditional authorities were engaged early in the process, which contributed to a successful implementation and ownership by the local community of the intervention promoting “no child left behind” and reaching them, despite challenges.  

The Marowijne WASH programme demonstrated enormous potential for scaling up, particularly through C4D for hygiene and safe drinking water. Children were very interested in the water quality testing technique used in the intervention and can be change agents not only in their own households for good hand washing/hygiene and sanitation practices, but also in the nearby schools and villages.

Looking forward 

In 2019, UNICEF will focus on a hybrid approach looking at: 

Building on proven interventions with high coverage that improve quality and programming excellence for at-scale results for child and adolescents - with a leitmotiv that ‘what gets measured, gets done’, and; 
Innovating in having a C4D behavioural objective addressing violence across the outcomes/outputs. The aim will be to align with the global Strategic Plan using process-oriented indicators and investing in looking a one or two behavioural indicators that could inform the organisation as a whole. Strategic and technical support from the UNICEF Regional Office and headquarters will be important in this process.

LACR,Haiti,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Eau, assainissement et hygiène 

Les efforts du secteur EAH, particulièrement de la DINEPA appuyée par le plaidoyer et l’assistance technique et financière d’UNICEF Haïti, ont permis au Gouvernement d’Haïti d’intégrer le ""Partenariat pour l'Assainissement et l'Eau pour Tous"". Cette intégration a été saluée par l’ensemble des acteurs du secteur et a favorisé la participation du gouvernement haïtien, à travers la DINEPA, à la convention internationale Mahatma Gandhi sur l’assainissement réalisée par le Gouvernement de l’Inde. A l’issue de cette convention, le Gouvernement d’Haïti s’est engagé à impliquer toutes les forces vives de la nation dans la lutte contre la défécation à l’air libre. Un mois de l’assainissement est planifié pour janvier 2019 pour engager principalement les maires à travers la signature d’un pacte d’engagement dans la lutte contre la défécation à l’air libre. 

Nutrition 

Les rencontres mensuelles des prestataires responsables de la prise en charge de la malnutrition aigüe ont nettement amélioré la qualité des services et la complétude des données programmatiques. Celles-ci ont fourni un forum de discussions et d’échanges entre les centres de santé et les directions départementales sanitaires.  

La collaboration entre le MSPP, l’Université McGill (Canada) et l’ONG FONDEFH avec l’appui technique et financier de l’UNICEF a permis la réalisation rapide et efficiente de l’enquête nationale sur la carence en iode. Le MSPP a fourni les ressources humaines ayant la connaissance du contexte et du terrain, l’Université McGill a apporté une rigueur scientifique à l’enquête avec son expertise en recherche appliquée et FONDEFH a facilité les aspects administratifs de l’enquête. C’est un modèle à reproduire à l’avenir où chaque entité offre un avantage comparatif et complémentaire. 

Éducation 

De la mise en œuvre, il est apparu clairement qu’afin d’avoir des résultats plus probants notamment dans le domaine des apprentissages, les interventions en salle de classes doivent prendre en compte l’ensemble des facteurs susceptibles d'influencer le rendement scolaire des élèves (matériels, formations, sensibilisations, activités extrascolaires, etc.). La promotion des compétences en lecture passe également par l’engagement des parents et de la communauté. Pour cela, UNICEF Haïti intègrera dès 2019 une stratégie participative de camps d’été impliquant les parents et la communauté. 

Les questions autour de l’enseignant sont également apparues comme des domaines ayant une influence importante sur l’apprentissage des enfants. Si les enseignants n’ont pas les qualifications de base requises pour occuper leur poste, il est difficile de rattraper leur déficit à travers des séances de formation, des journées pédagogiques et du matériel adéquat, malgré le focus programmatique sur le renforcement des capacités. Par contre, la mise en place de mécanismes et de mesures d’accompagnement régulier des enseignants dans leur travail en salles de classe, a montré des effets positifs sur le changement des pratiques d’enseignements et sur l’apprentissage des enfants. 

La collaboration avec les Directions Départementales de l’Éducation (DDE) et leur renforcement contribuent à assurer un meilleur suivi des activités sur le terrain et une responsabilisation accrue du Ministère. Plus proches des écoles, les DDE sont un partenaire de choix pour améliorer la mise en œuvre du programme.  

Protection 

La coordination d’action entre plusieurs acteurs dont les travailleurs sociaux, les psychologues et la police est un facteur d’efficacité dans l’identification et la gestion des cas d’enfants vulnérables afin d’assurer une meilleure protection des enfants. Par ailleurs, l’implication des personnes ressources au niveau des communautés (associations de femmes, comités de protection et l’assemblée de la section communale) et la synergie avec les secteurs médical, éducatif, et du relèvement économique a permis d'apporter des réponses holistiques selon les besoins identifiés et basées sur les droits humains. De même, le renforcement des liens avec le secteur privé facilite les passerelles entre l’offre et la demande d’emploi et permet d’assurer des opportunités de réinsertion socioprofessionnelle durable pour les jeunes en situation de vulnérabilité.  

En 2019, un accent particulier sera mis sur l’intersectorialité avec la santé, l’éducation et la justice pour assurer un accès holistique des enfants aux services de base. Le renforcement du partenariat avec le secteur privé notamment les fournisseurs de téléphonie mobile pour l’opérationnalisation de U-Report permettra de développer les échanges interactifs avec les jeunes à travers les médias sociaux. Les partenariats avec le secteur privé permettront en outre d’accroitre la durabilité et l’appropriation des interventions. 

Humanitaire 

Une des leçons apprises de 2018 dans le secteur Humanitaire provient de l’exercice d’évaluation multisectorielle de la réponse de UNICEF Haïti à l’ouragan Matthew sur la période 2016-2017. Les nombreuses recommandations mettent en avant l’importance de la préparation à l’urgence (planification, échelle, développement de documents communs pour l’évaluation des besoins), la meilleure coordination pendant l’urgence et la mise en œuvre de véritables mécanismes de communication avec les communautés affectées, de retours et de gestion des plaintes. Ces recommandations ont été récemment confirmées par un organisme indépendant [26] qui, s’il note une amélioration du travail des acteurs humanitaires en Haïti en 2017 et 2018, souligne néanmoins des marges de progression dans les domaines de la communication avec les populations, l’atteinte des plus vulnérables, et l’autonomisation réelle/résilience à d’éventuels chocs futurs. En réponse à ces recommandations, UNICEF Haïti a mis un accent particulier sur la préparation aux urgences en 2018, en (i) signant des PCA de contingence avec 3 partenaires pour une couverture de l’ensemble du pays, (ii) en formant la quasi-totalité des staffs-programme aux principes humanitaires, notamment l’approche « cash transfert », (iii) en développant des plans de contingence dans 2 départements-pilotes pour le secteur de l’Education, (iv) en multipliant les formations en gestion des risques et désastres auprès des partenaires gouvernementaux, (v) en développant des pack de réponse pour le secteur WASH (par type d’intervention, par ex. : water tracking, etc), (vi) en évaluant la faisabilité d’approche « cash » via des pre-crisis market assessment (PCMA), et (vii) en pilotant des approches « cash » dans les secteur WASH pour le traitement de l’eau à domicile (Artibonite) et pour la prévention de l’institutionnalisation des enfants (Grande Anse). 

Choléra 

Le programme choléra d’UNICEF Haïti, en appui au Plan national pour l’élimination du cholera en Haïti, a permis de maintenir sur l’ensemble du territoire national la transmission de la maladie à un niveau bas sans précédent. Les résultats obtenus notamment en termes de surveillance épidémiologique et de réponses communautaires, démontrent une réelle efficacité. Plusieurs départements n’ont plus aucune transmission active du vibrion. Dans la métropole, le dernier cas suspect de cholera confirmé en laboratoire date de plus de cinq mois. L’ensemble des moyens de lutte doit toutefois être maintenu pour réaliser l’élimination avant 2022. L’appui d’UNICEF Haïti et de OMS-PAHO dans les activités de surveillance a permis de renforcer la capacité des laboratoires et d’obtenir des résultats valorisables notamment dans la zone métropolitaine.

LACR,Honduras,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
1. Education in crisis

The efforts over the past year in education have been mainly strategic – working with the Secretary of Education to further inclusive and community-based approaches to strategically address education needs in rural contexts, with indigenous populations, in violent contexts and in addressing the 400,000 children remaining outside of the basic education (1st to 9th grade). 

Much pedagogical progress and strategic thinking occurred within these four areas. However, UNICEF Honduras’ education effort is spread across multiple areas, addressing the needs of multiple marginalized child populations, resulting in the results for children being contained to smaller numbers across the four areas. At the mid-term juncture of the country programme, UNICEF has an opportune moment to re-evaluate how to build on these experiences and scale-up a more targeted and focused education approach that is relevant and responsive to the current challenges and needs facing the education sector.These constraints are many, and include a lack of structural components, such as secondary schools, poverty, inequity, youth unemployment, weak institutional capacity and a manifestation of violence due to organized crime. 

Since Honduras has one of the highest homicide rates in the world and organized crime controls large areas of the country’s main cities, with education being the one social sector that remains intact, UNICEF Honduras could better position itself to leverage its education expertise. Children face particularly high risks of gang-related recruitment, violence and extortion. Forced displacement, threats, kidnapping, sexual violence and homicides are commonplace. For a child growing up, such circumstances can be likened to growing up in a conflict situation: violence, school-related gang violence and migration caused by violence have devastating impacts on their lives. In these communities affected by extreme violence, on average one child per household is out-of-school and at least one of every three children drop out after finishing grade 6. These indicators on out-of-school-children and drop-out rates starkly highlight that education is in crisis.  

Reflecting on UNICEF’s operational, programmatic and strategic strengths, it becomes evident that the organisation should be more responsive to the violence and migration afflicting the education system, as well as the situation of returnees. There is a clear need to reassess if UNICEF’s education interventions are fit for purpose and can help tackle the root causes of forced displacement and migration.

UNICEF Honduras’ existing education strategy has an overarching aim: to provide inclusive and quality education. A component of this seeks to ensure that children and adolescents suffering the most severe exclusion access quality and inclusive education. To address this, UNICEF has been focused on helping children start school on-time through early childhood development, reducing school drop-out rates in basic education, preventing drops-outs following the end of the second cycle of basic education and improving the quality and relevance of education, particularly in rural, indigenous and violent contexts. However, in recognition that education is in a state of crisis in contexts of high violence, a shift in the perspective or a new way of working is required to be responsive to the departments and municipalities that exist within such a humanitarian-development-peace nexus in recognition of the connections between sustainable development, humanitarian action and peace and security. 

UNICEF recognizes how the education sector is uniquely placed to advance coherence and alignment between humanitarian development policy and practice. Education in emergencies, and its links to child protection, supports access to safe, relevant and quality education and the promotion of psychosocial well-being of students and educators. It provides the foundation for cohesive communities and peaceful societies. Given its comparative advantage as a global lead within education in emergencies, UNICEF Honduras has an opportunity to focus its technical and financial investments to support the Secretary of Education in tackling violence, migration and returnees in the humanitarian-development-peace nexus. Concurrently, UNICEF must ensure that it is playing a country leadership role to meaningfully address the state of education in crisis. UNICEF Honduras is well placed to take advantage of developed strategies and resulting gains for children in violent contexts – particularly considering elements from the development of the peace-coexistence-citizenship strategy in schools and the educational bridges strategy to take forward, improve upon and scale-up. The construction of a community-based peace-coexistence-citizenship strategy has shown reductions in violence, particularly measured by children expressing a reduction of weapons in schools, verbally and emotionally abusive teachers and fights between children. Further, children have expressed they felt their opinions were valued and felt empowered to take decisions. For UNICEF moving forward, it will be important for these evidence-based gains to be built on in a more targeted and strategic way.

In this light, a refocus of the overarching aim is planned for the second half of the country programme: that goes beyond inclusion and quality, and addresses safety and relevance. It would aim to provide access to safe, inclusive (with special consideration to the needs of the displaced, returnees, girls, adolescent girls, and children experiencing disabilities), relevant and quality education ‘in crisis’ to address the needs of those affected by multiple types of violence and abuse, including school-related gender-based violence. It would emphasize leveraging education as an entry point to tackle the root causes of violence and migration, considering the school as a platform. Elements for further development and collaboration would include: 
Schools as an integrated platform: the development of a strategic and operational framework amongst UNICEF sectors - education, child protection, social protection, ECD and communication for development; 
Municipal targeting: targeting high-violence municipalities and working in a cross-sectoral manner at the municipal-level; 
Humanitarian-development coherence: via a sequenced or layered approach amongst humanitarian and development actors; strengthening UN-agency alliances/partnerships (UNESCO, UNHCR, IOM, etc.) providing different sequenced/overlapping forms of assistance to the same groups or geographical areas; 
Safe learning environments: via a community-based approach, building on the learnings and results from the peace-coexistence-citizenship strategy in school and the educational bridges; utilizing community groups such as student government bodies, sports/recreational clubs and community education clubs to foster safety , with a focus on creating safe spaces for girls and children/adolescents living with disabilities to have a voice; 
Alternative learning and educational bridging: leveraging information technology and innovations to increase access to education and improve learning of marginalized children and adolescents, with a focus on the specific needs of displaced and returnees’ children; 
Relevant education: ensuring that learning is holistic, and that learning, psychosocial support and social emotional learning and (life) skills development are relevant and applicable to the unique needs of adolescents, adolescent girls, girl mothers and children/adolescents living with disabilities; 
Systematic monitoring of results: at the municipal level, to use standardized indicators and monitoring systems to better tell the story of results for children over the second half of the country programme. This would include the development of customized indicators on accessfor children on the move, adolescent girls, children/adolescents experiencing disabilities, s (physical and psychological safety) and school-related gender-based violence, amongst others. 


2. Community-based model for violence reduction 

This year, with support from the Together for Girls Partnership, the Ministry of Security led the elaboration of a national Violence Against Children Survey, the first of its kind in the region to focus on identifying the magnitude and complex origins of violence against children in Honduras. On behalf of the Together for Girls Partnership, UNICEF led with assisting the Government to utilize the survey findings for the elaboration of a National Action Plan and Roadmap to End Violence Against Children, engaging multisectoral participation from both the state and civil society. To accompany this important work to end violence against children, UNICEF offices in Honduras and El Salvador jointly developed a C4D strategy on violence prevention, APAPACHAME (embrace me with affection). This focuses on changing social norms and behaviours based on positive parenting practices, non-violent interactions amongst peers and the prevention of sexual abuse. This strategy is consistent with UNICEF’s prioritization of violence reduction at the local level in rural settings, focused on intra-family and community-based physical and sexual violence. Violence reduction is also central to UNICEF’s work in protecting migrant children. The Violence Against Children Survey data underscored the nexus between violence and migratory flows and how this interaction perpetuates a cycle of increasing marginalization and human rights violations for children and adolescents.

While UNICEF's communication for development strategy and community-based programming are effectively targeting the main causes of violence against children in rural homes and communities – physical and humiliating punishment from parents, caretakers and peer-to-peer violence and bullying, and sexual abuse – a different approach is needed to more effectively protect children and adolescents in urban, gang-controlled settings in Honduras’ main cities. The need to refocus UNICEF’s strategy to Honduras’ more violent, gang-afflicted municipalities and communities is also aligned with a formal request from the Government for more targeted support in violence prevention and homicide reduction. 

UNICEF will develop strategies and partnerships to implement specialized interventions aimed at changing norms and interrupting violence, based on levels of violence exposure in each community, looking to reduce violence and homicide, improve protective factors and community resilience through targeted actions within the homes, community spaces and schools. Specifically, UNICEF will define differentiated strategies based on an epidemiological approach that consider the presence of gangs, level of community cohesion, corruption, and the presence/absence of state institutions to reduce chronic violence. This local intervention will be linked with the current municipal and national child protection systems-strengthening work to better connect local actors with child protection services. In doing so, this will better position and scale-up successful local interventions, influence State policies and funding including the elaboration of the National Action Plan and Roadmap to End Violence Against Children, and prioritize actions that directly protect children and adolescents in f these violent, conflict-prone communities. UNICEF’s more recent partnership with the Ministry of Security provides a timely opportunity to step up efforts in reducing violence against children and adolescents in these urban contexts. However, new partnerships with local actors and community-based organizations will be required to effectively intervene at the local level.

To achieve this revised vision, UNICEF Honduras will fully integrate its violence reduction work in its core actions, readjusting programming in child protection, education and social inclusion to better respond to the complex realities of urban violence, create protective spaces within schools and communities. In collaboration with key partners, UNICEF will support the implementation of effective local violence and homicide reduction interventions that are monitored and assessed through a robust set of epidemiological indicators.

3. Municipalities as effective spaces for children and adolescents 

Municipal governments are potent agents of change in transforming the lives of girls, boys and adolescents due to their closeness to the population, civic mandate and management of plans, budgets and human resources. They are responsive to public opinion, and thus more open to investing effectively in children and adolescents under an imperative to showcase tangible results from their public management as a means for ensuring public satisfaction and eventual re-election. 

With UNICEF guidance, this level of government has been providing services to promote and protect children and adolescents’ rights with varying degrees of success. However, indicators measuring progress in guaranteeing the fulfilment of the rights of children show there remain serious challenges in ensuring access to and quality of basic social services and protection of children against violence and abuse. It is imperative to accelerate UNICEF’s efforts to achieve results for children and adolescents.

UNICEF Honduras has developed a work strategy at subnational level, under the criterion of programmatic comprehensiveness and geographical convergence. The purpose is to install at the municipal level, a coordination mechanism that articulates the participation of public institutions, NGOs, CBOs and the private sector to provide appropriate services and responses to promote and protect children’s rights. Through UNICEF’s ongoing support of municipal governments to build their public financial management and service provision capacities for children, some key lessons learned were identified.

Although municipal plans integrate specific results for children, such as hiring of teachers, building schools and funding school feeding programmes, these often lack strategic clarity, sustainability in time and indicators for effective performance measurement and results tracking. Nor have children’s voices been considered when prioritizing child-specific municipal results. In addition, the varying capacities and knowledge of municipal employees, combined with limited information available in most municipalities, have made it difficult to adapt training modules and technical support to local realities incorporating an equity lens. Capacity development of local officials requires technical accompaniment closer to the one originally planned, which necessitates greater field presence of UNICEF staff to collaboratively develop the public management for children tools with a focus on learning by doing.

The municipalities have led the establishment of inter-institutional coordination workgroups (Municipal Councils for Childhood and Adolescence) to effectively pool public and private funding and resources to promote programmes, activities and improve municipal service provision for children. A key weakness, however, remains in coordinating an effective response to individual cases of violence and abuse against children. Municipalities underscore a lack of knowledge as to which institutions to contact to respond to specific cases of child vulnerabilities, abuse and violence.

Based on lessons learned, during the second half of the country programme, UNICEF will promote a results-based approach in which the municipalities, in a self-directed manner, generate changes in the lives of children, for which the following adjustments will be made to the current work approach with municipalities. It will encourage a result-based approach to municipal programming that focuses on achieving changes in the lives of girls, boys and adolescents. To achieve this, UNICEF will promote a ‘Certification of Results for Children’ approach, under the leadership of a collegial body made up of representatives of the academic sector, Government and UNICEF. Transparency in the certification process and accountability by participating municipalities will be pillars of the certification scheme.

UNICEF will also help establish an incentive system that stimulates proactive local management in the progress of selected Public Management for Children indicators with participation of national State authorities. This is indispensable in guaranteeing municipal autonomy aligned with the national law for decentralization of public management, while contributing to innovation and local creativity in the achievement of results through incentives. This could include establishing a small grant facility, eventually managed by an NGO, to support small community initiatives with groups of women, adolescents and/or indigenous and Afro-descendant organizations normally ineligible for other funding mechanisms because they do not have legal status. UNICEF will also help the municipal governments improve their responses in early childhood development, for children out-of-school, victims of violence or abuse, and for the effective reintegration of returned migrants. This will primarily be through the elaboration of operational guidelines defining clear roles, responsibilities and accountabilities of both local and State actors through the Municipal Councils for Childhood and Adolescence.

LACR,Jamaica,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Establish the grounds for scalability and sustainability of UNICEF interventions
UNICEF Jamaica implemented important pilot interventions, with positive results to address existing gaps in multiple areas, mainly in collaboration with civil society partners and with inputs from government entities. These included interventions to establish more inclusive and disability-friendly early childhood centres, community-based violence prevention, sports-based violence reduction interventions, support for young female survivors of sexual violence and a child road safety initiative. One of the key challenges UNICEF Jamaica faces is the scalability and sustainability of these successful interventions.  

Among the lessons learned was the fact that gaining the commitment from line ministries at the early stage of the pilot interventions is critical to successfully negotiate possibilities for scale up. At the early stages of pilot programmes, UNICEF Jamaica needs to define with all stakeholders  medium- and long-term goals, along with a realistic roadmap to achieve them. Much attention was often paid to making the pilot phase successful, rather than to developing a longer-term roadmap. 

UNICEF has also learned the importance of factoring in the costing aspect of projects, as those with extremely high unit cost are less likely to be institutionalized by state entities, thus decreasing the prospects of sustainability.  

Monitoring of pilot interventions needs to be strengthened so that results can be demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative evidence, beyond anecdotal evidence or perceptions of impact. Solid evidence of successful interventions supports UNICEF advocacy for further investments in scaling up and sustaining interventions. It is important that projects include a formal, rigorous evaluation as well as a costing exercise that provides an estimate of the funds required to scale up the initiative.

Enhance UNICEF’s engagement on social protection and analysis of public financing for children
Progress in this area of work has been slow and challenged by the absence of the necessary dedicated human and financial resources.

Social protection has been identified as one of the accelerators to reach the SDGs and reduce poverty in Jamaica. A number of international development partners already are engaged with the Government of Jamaica to support social protection initiatives (including UNDP, USAID, World Bank, FAO and the IADB). UNICEF is well positioned as a potential interlocutor on child-sensitive social protection programmes. The Ministry of Labour and Social Security has expressed its interest in collaborating with UNICEF in 2019 to strengthen ongoing social protection programmes to reach the most vulnerable children. 

In 2019, UNICEF Jamaica will work on refining the theory of change and strategies for the Child Rights Monitoring and Multi-dimensional Poverty outcome to adjust to the needs expressed by the Government of Jamaica. UNICEF Jamaica also will mobilize new resources for this programmatic component, broker new partnerships and continue initial efforts to promote horizontal cooperation with Mexico. It is expected that this push will eventually enable UNICEF to play a more significant role in social inclusion by supporting more child-sensitive and inclusive social protection programmes and child-sensitive budget analysis for high-level advocacy.

Leverage the United Nations Multi-Country Sustainable Development Framework
The UN Multi-Country Sustainable Development Framework has provided a framework for greater collaboration and programme coordination among UN agencies and across UNICEF country offices in the Dutch- and English-speaking Caribbean. At country level, UNICEF Jamaica actively engaged in framework results groups, leading or co-leading several, including Safety and Security, M&E and Human Rights. UNICEF and the UN system could further maximize the opportunities that this Common Results Framework provides for more integrated programming, fundraising and aggregation of results.

The midterm review of UNICEF Jamaica’s country programme provides an opportunity to review strategies and address gaps in order to improve collaboration among UNICEF Caribbean Country offices and to maximize the benefits of the Multi-Country Sustainable Development Framework joint theories of change. The midterm review also should serve to identify new collaborative work modalities and opportunities for joint programming with UN agencies in-country, in line with the ongoing reform of the United Nations system to deliver on the 2030 Agenda. 

Sharpen programme focus
UNICEF Jamaica programmes were spread across multiple areas and included a wide range of small-scale interventions and pilot community-based projects, implemented in many cases through civil society organizations. Some of those interventions provided opportunities for advocacy and for scalability. In other cases, the multiple areas of focus reduced opportunities to engage in more upstream work with the Government that would allow for the achievement of key results at scale in critical areas set by the Agenda 2030 and Jamaica’s National Development Plan, Vision 2030. 

As UNICEF Jamaica approaches the midterm of the country programme, it should assess the strategies implemented over the first course of the programme cycle and strike the right balance between upstream initiatives such as evidence generation, advocacy and policy dialogue, and those that provide support to government interventions and community-based projects.

Multipronged strategy to eradicate violence against children at home
Violence at home was the most common form of violence against children in Jamaica, but little progress was made in 2018 with amending or creating legislation to ban the administering of corporal punishment in all settings and reduce the social acceptability of such practices by caregivers. More efforts are needed to establish a multisectoral, multipronged strategy to eradicate violence against children at home. That strategy should include conducting advocacy at the highest levels of government and civil society, strengthening the capacity of the social workforce and partners to deliver Communication for Development (C4D) initiatives and conducting parenting courses that promote alternative methods of discipline and international standards of child care. Support also should be provided to community initiatives that seek to influence the behaviour of residents and direct community resources toward positive forms of discipline.

LACR,Mexico,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
In terms of political advocacy, as a core part of the strategy to implement the current country programme, UNICEF Mexico increased networking during the government transition to establish contacts and a close working relationship with the new Government. Other activities were delayed as a result of the focus on advocacy. After the 2018 elections, the government transition meant that the out-going administration became less active which slowed down the implementation of the work plan, but it also was an opportunity to sensitize the incoming administration on child rights’ issues. A good practice that evolved was the establishment of an ‘elections task force’ in the country office, where information was shared on a weekly basis and advocacy decisions made based on the rapidly evolving situation. It is an example of a task force and working mechanism that the country office should try to replicate on other issues and in similar evolving contexts.

Three of the four presidential candidates signed a commitment on the UNICEF premises to implement child rights policies if elected. This important achievement is unprecedented in the history of UNICEF Mexico. The country office organized the effort immediately upon the start of the presidential campaign, making it easier to mobilize the candidates, to join the signing ceremony at the UNICEF Mexico office. The strategy of seeking available contacts was a good lesson.

With the intensity of the transition to a new Government, UNICEF Mexico’s good practice was to position and make visible priority issues and actions for the protection of the rights of children and adolescents through the use of evidence, tools and concrete solutions. For example, the Agenda for Children and Adolescents, a brief document UNICEF Mexico produced, provided five priorities with solid evidence and action required for each. Likewise, a document on the actions required to care for children and adolescents in an emergency context---in this case, the migration crisis---positioned UNICEF as a strategic actor and an organization equipped the incoming authorities. 

In general, and particularly in times of transition and changes in government, the demand for UNICEF training on children's and adolescents' rights is great, with limited capacity for response. In 2018, a more coherent and prioritized child-rights’ strengthening initiative for civil servants was initiated, involving SE-SIPINNA, Save the Children, UNICEF Mexico and two non-government organizations. The initiative consists of four, 120-hour online courses on child rights for up to 500 civil servants per cohort. While this is the most strategic initiative thus far, it still requires additional investment and resources dedicated from UNICEF for it to be a viable and sustainable solution. 

At the sub-national level, a best practice strategy involved technical consultants in the field who addressed specific issues, generated results, and enabled UNICEF to have a direct benefit on the lives of children and adolescents. The work in the field also generated evidence to bring projects to scale and that verified the application of the models, the protocols and other tools promoted by UNICEF. However, as regards the sub-national strategy in general, new approaches would help UNICEF have effective inter-sector presence and also incidence at state level as well.

In 2017, UNICEF Mexico responded quickly and comprehensively to two massive earthquakes that struck Mexico within 12 days of each other. Building on the immediate experience of this emergency, and two after-action reviews UNICEF conducted, ensured a more agile and swift response to the migrant caravans from Central America that passed through Mexico in 2018. For example, supplies were quickly procured as needs were clearly established; the county office was equipped with experienced human resources who were working on rehabilitation of the earthquake response; stand-by programme partnerships had been established; internal procedures, including reporting, meetings, roles and responsibilities, were activated quickly and with experience; and UNICEF staff were able to apply their recent experience gained from the earthquake response. These accomplishments were a testament to the country office staff quickly learning lessons from the previous emergency experience. Despite the fact that the caravan was a complicated emergency, UNICEF Mexico was able to respond on different fronts simultaneously and accommodate, literally, a moving target. 

Regarding communications and advocacy, UNICEF Mexico made a strategic shift to specifically address messages and message forms to specific audiences. Live streams and short video clips were recorded for posting on the internet. As a result of strategic relations with media outlets, the UNICEF Mexico presence rose in the top-tier media by 289 per cent compared to 2017. 

In terms of internal processes, UNICEF Mexico followed its ambitious PRIME plan that contemplated 18 studies, evaluations and surveys. With focus shifted to the incoming Government, which had been difficult to anticipate and plan for, the bar was set unrealistically high for PRIME in 2018 and a number of PRIME activities were delayed. The effort that was required to manage, supervise and provide feedback for each outsourced study or evaluation was not sufficiently assessed. In 2019, more realistic planning will be considered.

The fifth year of the Country Programme Document’s implementation reached a point of maturity, particularly in terms of strengthening child-protection mechanisms. The achievements of 2018 would have not been possible without the progress made since 2014. The work of UNICEF Mexico has proven that a well-constructed vision results in life-changing programmes for children in the country. The sound experience provided a solid basis to design the new country programme document, together with the Government and partners from civil society and academia. UNICEF Mexico will continue to fulfil child rights in the country, leaving no child behind.

"
LACR,Nicaragua,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Lessons learned and constraints are from the entire Cooperation Programme (2013-1018).

Cooperation at the local level in the two Autonomous Regions of the Caribbean Coast involved developing partnership with both the Autonomous Regional Governments of the South Caribbean Coast (GRACCS) and the North Caribbean Coast (GRACCN), including opening UNICEF field offices in Bluefields and Bilwi. This programmatic approach lost strategic cooperation with ministries at the central level. It also created an overlap of interventions in the geographic area where programmes implemented by the national ministries and the initiatives of the regional Governments coincided.  

Considering that the UNICEF Nicaragua mandate applies to the entire national territory, the implementation of universal public policies requires a balance between presence at the central level and anchoring at the local level with relevant institutions. Actually, in a situation where there are Autonomous Local Governments, one of the added values of UNICEF cooperation is precisely to facilitate the articulation and coordination between the different levels of government (national and local) within the legislative framework that regulate decentralization in the country.  

Above all, it is essential to develop joint planning processes based on the identification of national priorities and defining their implementation at the local level. It is necessary to understand the functioning and institutional role of the different partners in order to adapt UNICEF cooperation to their dimensions and objectives, which is a critical aspect to anchor the programmes sustainably. Based on this analysis, corrective measures, such as promoting joint planning spaces with Autonomous Regional Governments and Central Ministries, were taken during the last two years of the Cooperation Programme, which gave the opportunity to re-establish a certain balance, highlighting the lessons learned. 

The 2013-2018 Cooperation Programme faced difficulties with access to updated and opportune official data and statistical information. The last Nicaraguan Health and Demography Survey, ENDESA, which incorporated many indicators related to UNICEF’s mandate, was carried out in 2011. The lack of updated indicators and the absence of other sources of official information was a barrier to monitor the situation of children in the country and measure the impact of UNICEF cooperation with a results-based approach.  

The bottlenecks generated learning opportunities, however. In this context, generating baseline at the beginning of an intervention is essential, as a starting point to monitor and evaluate the intervention. Another way to address a lack of official public information is to develop studies with institutional partners, in the context of the Cooperation Programme. For example, the good practice with the Legal Forensic Institute which produced two studies on violence against children and adolescents for the periods 2013-2015 and 2016-2017. The quality and relevance of the information were crucial to analyse and understand the causes and effects of violence against children and adolescents in the country. The Legal Forensic Institute and UNICEF were invited to present this experience at the United Nations World Data Forum organized in Dubai in 2018.

In recent years, the programmes implemented by UNICEF were marked by innovation and the development of pilot projects. The lessons learned were identified during the evaluation carried out in 2017 to analyse seven pilot projects implemented in the Caribbean Coast. One of these lessons is that before developing a new initiative, it is essential to have a shared conceptual framework with partners to design, implement, monitor and evaluate the intervention. In addition to a theory of change (including objectives, strategies, risks, assumptions) the conceptual framework must have clear goals and indicators with a focus on results-based management. This will facilitate the evaluation, dissemination, scaling-up and sustainability of the interventions, and provide the necessary information for the systematization and documentation of the strategies.  

These requirements are important when dealing with model experiences and it is key to ensure the presence of UNICEF Nicaragua in the territories for technical support in implementation. The systematization and documentation of the strategies should not be limited to evaluation, but rather have a continuity perspective. It is worth mentioning that a large part of these lessons learned were used to design and initiate the implementation of UNICEF's volunteering strategy in 2018.

The Cooperation Programme that ended in 2018 demonstrated that the intersectoral programmes and implementing joint strategies by the different programme areas reach interesting achievements. For example, the prevention of child sexual abuse was addressed by both child protection and education programmes. The programmes developed transversal initiatives that involved various institutions such as the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Family, Ministry of Health, through funds shared by different programmes. The lessons learned from intersectoral experiences such as the prevention of child sexual abuse and the comprehensive development of early childhood serve to design new initiatives, such as the strategy of adolescent participation in the Cooperation Programme 2019-2023. 

Within the intersectoral framework of the 2013-2018 Cooperation Programme, communication for development was important to reach programmatic results, and achieved institutionalization in the Ministry of Health. The intersectoral implementation of the communication for development strategy for the prevention of sexual abuse against children was important, as was the alliance with the ND Media consortium to disseminate educational messages for well-defined behaviours. In the Cooperation Programme 2019-2023, the communication for development component is a core cross-cutting strategy in programme implementation, to systematize and disseminate the country office experience on this matter.

At different moments of the 2013-2018 Cooperation Programme, bottlenecks were experienced to implement HACT activities. Depending on the Government’s authorization to implement micro assessments, spot checks or audits, the activities suffered delays or even cancellations. Based on the lessons learned from the difficulties, the country office developed mitigation mechanisms to improve implementation. In the future, UNICEF Nicaragua will seek to directly incorporate these quality assurance activities in the annual work plans signed with the implementing partners so that they are validated and authorized in advance by the Government.

Finally, there were lessons learned by Nicaragua’s recent socio-political crisis. In this context, UNICEF Nicaragua quickly ascertained that it was essential to balance its respected relationship with the Government while fulfilling its mandate to contribute children’s rights to health, nutrition, education and protection. UNICEF Regional Office support was key to develop a risk assessment, to closely monitor the situation and to respond. In line with results of risk assessments, training workshops were conducted to strengthen the capacities of civil society organizations and government institutions on psychosocial care for children in emergency situations. UNICEF staff also received training on ethical management of social networks.

"
LACR,Panama,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
1) Emergency preparedness and humanitarian action for a country office with limited resources 
In 2018, UNICEF Panama faced the challenge to develop its emergency preparedness capacities (i.e. emergency preparedness platform related actions) and to implement humanitarian actions in remote areas. The main constraints included the following: insufficient human resources; limited presence in remote areas that are in proximity to humanitarian needs; limited logistical capacity, given that UNICEF’s minimum structure for upstream policy works in upper-middle or high-income country offices; and the need to also comply with the programme demands of the country programme document, alongside the new and standard reporting requests forall humanitarian action plan countries. 

UNICEF Panama recognizes the importance of preparedness and response mechanisms for emergencies, and the country office should have strong mechanisms and capacities to face emergencies. UNICEF Panama will enhance resilience by implementing the following activities: the internal emergency response plan for the migration flow; preparing a risk-informed situation analysis; complete and follow-up actions from the emergency preparedness platform; and develop capacities of all staff in humanitarian action. 

Additionally, evidence on the insufficient quality of the water, sanitation and hygiene services for children is an issue for UNICEF Panama, as the country programme no longer has a WASH component or the human resources capacity to support Government toward the Sustainable Development Goals. 

UNICEF’s planning must consider disaster risk. UNICEF will continue to identify and address the risks faced by children and adolescents in Panama. It will ensure safe and resilient conditions for them; advocate internally for funding to improve its preparedness and response capacities; and integrate the humanitarian action, when possible, into the scaling up of the country programme. Flexible reporting for countries that face the small-scale emergencies that can be responded to by scaling-up the regular country programme would reduce organizational burden andcontribute to merge humanitarian action and development programmes. 

2) Positioning UNICEF Panama  with partners to advocate and leverage resources for children 
UNICEF rarely works with one partner alone, and most achievements are the result of partnerships and collaborations. The actors involved are diverse, and agendas may not always coincide with UNICEF’s vision of ensuring children’s rights. UNICEF results can be jeopardized andcooperation diminished when partners do not have a clear understanding of UNICEF´s goals. 

The different agendas that actors bring to the process, when understood and combined with UNICEF advocacy for child rights, produce impactful partnerships and synergies. This potential is still untapped, and UNICEF Panama will increase its effort on shared value partnerships. 

The further upstream UNICEF’s work is, the more complex and diverse the partnerships, for example: advocating for a multidimensional childhood poverty measurement; achieving the support to generate a national budget for children, and contributing to develop a national strategy for early childhood development. UNICEF Panama is in a better position to produce results when, in addition to specific outputs, it is part of processes from the beginning. This allows UNICEF to develop an understanding of complex interactions between actors with diverse interests and agendas. As a result, UNICEF is placed in a better position to produce the required outputs more effectively, and with greater focus on the local context. 

For the final two years of the current country programme, UNICEF Panama will continue its active participation and leadership in the United Nations system and strengthen its role as convener of multiple partners. Working closely with multilateral institutions, international financial institutions and the private sector for mid- and long-term goals will contribute to a more effective cooperation, making a positive impact based on the child rights. 

Positioning UNICEF as a leader in all of the above (humanitarian assistance, United Nations Country Team, and shared value partnerships), while ensuring its programmatic and financial sustainability, requires investment from the organization in terms of its vision and human resources structure. The biggest lesson learned may be the time and investment from the organization beyond the country office. 

3. Policies and services for adolescents and young people
The main concerns in Panama include the following: violence against children, particularly against adolescents (including sexual violence); a lack of opportunities for adolescents; stigmatization against adolescents; a lack of adolescent-oriented services; high rates of pregnancy; and high rates of out-of-school adolescents. UNICEF Panama took steps, with the support of UNICEF Regional Office, towards a more integrated and holistic approach to face the challenge of incorporating adolescents into the public agenda. Panama is starting a process of decentralization that could be an opportunity to support local governments that have a commitment to develop services for adolescents and young people. 

UNICEF Panama learned that involving children, especially adolescents, in analysing the situation of child rights is key. It improves the quality of interventions and guarantees their right to participation. UNICEF Panama sought to promote children and adolescent’s advisory councils in three cities and promoted the participation of children and adolescents in the situation analysis. The processes benefited from their opinions and views.  

The young people’s agenda (GenU) is an opportunity for UNICEF Panama to reinforce its support to non-government organisations and local and national institutions, especially municipalities,  that have or aim to have youth-focused services. An internal analysis and development of theory of change for adolescents indicated that UNICEF Panama was engaging in activities for and with the adolescents; the need remains to consolidate the diverse potential into an impact under a common framework such as GenU. The support from UNICEF Regional Office for such consolidation was instrumental and UNICEF Panama required continued support in this area from both UNICEF Regional Office and UNICEF Headquarters.  

One constraint is the many programmes and projects implemented by different organizations that aim to improve the quality of life of adolescents, but lack strong evidence suggesting a positive impact. Another constraint is that these initiatives and most of the services are only provided by civil society, with occasional government financial support. Under these circumstances, UNICEF Panama proposes to strengthen its monitoring and evaluation approach to identify an initiative that is effective and could be scaled up or adapted to a different local context. 

4) Building a strong fundraising strategy
In 2018, UNICEF Panama, following the plans for growth, recruited a partnership specialist with the objective of developing a fundraising strategy. Long-term agreements are in place, developed and negotiated with support from the UNICEF regional office, to offer ‘face-to-face’services and donor management services. A plan is in place with high expectations, given the positive environment for this purpose in Panama. 

To ensure productive and sustainable corporate alliances, the corporate fundraising strategy 2019-2020 focuses on leveraging UNICEF’s brand assets to raise flexible funds through multi-year ‘cause marketing and customer fundraising’. Multi-year, multi-layered grant opportunities of substantial nature will be explored when appropriate. The strategy aims to ensure that, when targeting a corporate entity, the best possible engagement mechanism to yield the highest return on investment is secured. 

UNICEF Panama, based on a mapping analysis, will direct initial efforts to the areas of insurance;information communication and technology; and privately-owned utilities to seek fundraising alliances using the models effective in countries of the region. At a second stage, when appropriate, the banking sector will be included. 

The main constraint UNICEF Panama faces is not being able to access investment funds for pilot projects. The regular resources are allocated at minimum, given the size of the child population and the gross national income per capita level. Implementing are invigorated vision of shared value partnerships with the private sector beyond fundraising requires UNICEF investment (‘know how’, human resources and financial resources) for new high-income countries such as Panama. The UNICEF Regional Office was very supportive and is offering its technical expertise and support to facilitate the development of fundraising in Panama. However, organizational initiatives that tap into the potential of Panama’s fundraising and shared value partnerships market are welcome. 

After two years of a regional market development approach, led by the UNICEF Regional Office, and multi-country alliances that proved there is market potential to be developed in Panamain a cost-effective way (through a corporate customer fundraising strategy and individual fundraising strategy), UNICEF Panama is ready to initiate a pilot to explore a viable strategy and continue the present fundraising strategy (with shared value partnerships view) until the end of this country programme in 2020.

LACR,Paraguay,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"El presente apartado presenta cuatro lecciones aprendidas por un lado y buenas prácticas por otro, con sus antecedentes y resultados obtenidos.

1) El 2018 ha sido un año particularmente importante en materia de alianzas y recaudación de fondos para la oficina de país en donde la Oficina ha aprendido sobre su relacionamiento con el sector privado y la importancia de comunicar mejor como estamos incidiendo en la vida de los niños, niñas y adolescentes; así como la necesidad de realizar esfuerzos sostenido e inversiones en los últimos años para lograr un mejor posicionamiento. Como resultado, la oficina de país movilizó en el 2018 y a nivel local, USD 1.222.000. 

Los avances son resultados de un proceso de fortalecimiento del trabajo de comunicación y posicionamiento institucional de la organización a nivel local, basado en el diseño de campañas de comunicación de alto impacto con alcance masivo y de alianzas con algunos sectores influyentes de la sociedad: sector privado, medios de comunicación, influencers, entre otros. Asimismo, se debe destacar la cooperación recibida de las oficinas de Unicef en Uruguay y Argentina y de la Oficina Regional de Unicef con experiencia en el área de movilización de recursos, quienes apoyaron el diseño y seguimiento a estrategias de alianzas y recaudación de fondos. Inicialmente la estrategia se basó en “alianzas corporativas” e incluyó la conformación de un Consejo Consultivo Empresarial que aglutina a referentes del sector privado dispuestos a brindar su mirada estratégica, movilizar recursos y voluntades en favor de los derechos de los niños. También se fundamentó en las alianzas con un número de empresas asociadas a Unicef y a la infancia; y en un gran evento anual de recaudación de fondos que reúne al sector privado. Este año, la oficina de país ha dado un paso crucial con el inicio de una experiencia piloto para captar donantes individuales cuyos resultados esperamos se empiecen a dar en el próximo programa de cooperación 2020_2024. 

Durante el 2018, la quinta edición de la cena anual de recaudación de fondos organizada por Unicef junto con el Consejo Consultivo Empresarial aglutinó a más de 70 empresas y reunió USD 187.000. Gran parte de estos fondos fueron utilizados para la instalación de un modelo social de protección para los niños, niñas y adolescentes que viven, trabajan o pasan mucho tiempo en el principal mercado público de abastecimiento de alimentos de la capital, en alianza con instituciones del Estado. 

En el marco de un acuerdo entre Itaipú-Binacional (la compañía pública hidroeléctrica) y Unicef, Itaipú aportó USD 2.700.000 para el periodo 2014 - 2018. Con estos fondos se apoyó la disminución de la mortalidad materna y neonatal en el país, con capacitaciones, infraestructura y equipamiento. A finales de 2018, Unicef renovó el acuerdo con Itaipú por valor de USD 1.000.000, que será implementado a partir del 2019 en el área de la salud familiar.

Una alianza con Asismed (una de las compañías de medicina prepaga más importantes del país) brindó USD 50.000 para la compra de equipos de Presión Continua en la vía aérea (CPAP por sus siglas en inglés) en el marco del Proyecto Fortalecimiento de las Unidades de Cuidados Intensivos Neonatales de 6 maternidades del país a fin de contribuir en la reducción de muertes entre los recién nacidos prematuros.

Unicef ha construido una alianza sostenida a lo largo de los años con la empresa Tigo en la que se conjugan aspectos programáticos de interés común como la tecnología, innovación y la protección de la infancia. La alianza incluye no solamente la recaudación de fondos sino aportes en especie (in kind), que aprovechan la diversidad de canales de comunicación que presenta la firma. Aproximadamente USD 60.000 fueron movilizados en el 2018. De estos, USD 35.000 se destinaron para financiar parcialmente la construcción y equipamiento del Centro de Atención Integral de protección a niños, niñas y adolescentes del Mercado de Abasto. Los aportes en especie se reflejaron en campañas como “Tu Bebé” y ¨la Venta Más Difícil¨, para captar datos de donantes individuales. 

Un paso importante fue la puesta en marcha de la experiencia piloto para la recaudación de fondos de donantes individuales paraguayos, con el apoyo de Unicef Argentina. Paraguay es el único país emergente que está comenzando a recaudar fondos de individuos al mismo tiempo que genera alianzas con el sector privado. En menos de 6 meses captó 300 donantes individuales. El objetivo para el 2020 es llegar a 3.300 personas donando a Unicef. A través de esta cooperación sur-sur, Unicef Argentina proporciona la financiación inicial de la campaña de donación (piloto), plataforma de donación (Donor Perfect) y supervisión directa de la campaña por el equipo de marketing. Este esfuerzo ha requerido mayor coordinación entre ambas oficinas y también al interior de la oficina país, con las áreas de programas, comunicación y movilización de recursos.

La oficina de país tiene muy presente el tema de CRB (Child Rights & Business) en la mayoría de los componentes programáticos y se ha materializado en resultados a través de distintos proyectos como el de promoción de la lectura, exclusión educativa, protección y prevención de la violencia hacia adolescentes, salud materna y neonatal, desarrollo infantil oportuno, entre otros.

Como país de mercado emergente (Non- PFP), Unicef seguirá fortaleciendo su estrategia y estructura de recaudación de fondos a nivel local, a fin de contar con una fuente de financiamiento que le posibilite dar continuidad y sostenibilidad a los programas a favor de la niñez sin depender totalmente de la fluctuación de fondos de donantes internacionales, no siempre orientados a los temas de relevancia para el contexto nacional. En vistas a la formulación del nuevo programa de cooperación de Unicef con el país, se abre una ventana de oportunidad para crear la estructura necesaria. La estrategia de la Oficina se ha desarrollado en tres momentos: a) Posicionamiento de UNICEF y de los programas que desarrolla; b)  Desarrollo de alianzas con el sector privado; c) Implementación de una estrategia de captación de donantes individuales.

2) Unicef consiguió posicionar el tema de la exclusión educativa en el país dentro de la agenda de los candidatos a la presidencia de la república en el marco de las elecciones presidenciales en Abril/2018: identificando que 6 de cada 10 niños que empiezan el colegio, no terminan la secundaria. Para ello se capitalizó la experiencia de un proceso de trabajo similar realizado en el 2013. Del aprendizaje, se relevó la necesidad de priorizar dentro de la agenda política, un tema aglutinante para trabajarlo a través de una Campaña de Comunicación Masiva que acompañara al proceso de abogacía. Así también, Unicef se posicionó como un interlocutor visible en temas de infancia para las nuevas autoridades que asumieron sus cargos en el mes de Agosto/2018, de la mano de un tema considerado como de gran déficit y relevancia en Paraguay, como es el de la educación.

La Campaña “Pregúntale a tu candidato” - realizada durante las elecciones presidenciales - tuvo una importante repercusión a nivel nacional y se convirtió en uno de los principales temas del único debate presidencial realizado antes de las elecciones. El presidente electo incluyó las cifras de la campaña de Unicef en su discurso de toma de posesión del cargo. Así mismo, el presidente electo ratificó los 20 Compromisos por la Niñez y Adolescencia elaborados por el Frente para la Infancia y la Adolescencia, con apoyo de Unicef, durante su primer día de su administración. Uno de los 20 compromisos es “una educación de calidad para todos los niños, niñas y adolescentes de Paraguay, con indicadores que hacen alusión a la exclusión educativa”.

3) En temas de Primera Infancia, Unicef es un interlocutor de referencia. En el 2018 Unicef aportó especialmente al posicionamiento del tema en la agenda pública a través de sus campañas y acciones de comunicación como son Early Moments Matter, 1000 días de amor y Juguetes para toda la vida.

Durante el 2018 se realizó una evaluación al Programa Supervivencia y Desarrollo Infantil (2014-2019). La evaluación considera que el programa tiene un alto nivel de relevancia, ajustándose a los objetivos y prioridades de política pública del país desde un enfoque de derechos y se ejecuta en territorios que han tenido altas tasas de mortalidad materna y neonatal. El programa ha cumplido un importante rol, sensibilizando tanto a los responsables de la política pública a nivel central como a los ejecutores de la misma en el territorio. La evidencia sugiere que éste trabajo, junto con la decisión del Gobierno del Paraguay de incluir la temática en la agenda han llevado a que, la reducción de la tasa de mortalidad materna y neonatal sea una prioridad tanto a nivel nacional como en el territorio. En varias entrevistas, se valoró positivamente este cambio en la actitud de los responsables de proveer los servicios a madres y niños, tanto en el embarazo como en el parto. Existe coincidencia en considerar, que no es aceptable tener muertes prevenibles de madres o niños durante el parto. Los entrevistados reconocen, que cada vez que eso sucede ahora, pasa a ser un problema que requiere de decisiones, tanto para los responsables de las unidades de salud, como para las autoridades. Los actores del nivel central del Ministerio de Salud han reconocido así mismo la oportunidad del programa para que sea ampliado a otros territorios.

Sin embargo, aún la atención de la primera infancia es poco visible desde las políticas públicas, es urgente y necesaria, sobre todo en lo referente al aumento de cobertura y calidad de los servicios. Si bien la Política Nacional de Desarrollo Integral de la Primera Infancia cumplirá 10 años, no se disponen de datos de cobertura de programas de atención a la primera infancia de la población entre 0 y 2 años o del impacto de la misma. Por ello la Oficina ha revisado sus estrategias para trascender los procesos de formación de los funcionarios públicos al desarrollo de capacidades institucionales y a la generación de evidencia.

En este contexto, Unicef ha logrado fortalecer las acciones en la Primera Infancia (primeros días 1.000) tanto al interior en sus componentes del programa de cooperación, como al exterior en la esfera pública, por medio del fortalecimiento de capacidades en instituciones del nivel central y municipal. Ha trabajado con el Ministerio de Educación y Ciencias (MEC), el Ministerio de Salud (MSP), el Ministerio de la Niñez y Adolescencia (MINNA) y el Ministerio de Desarrollo Social (MDS) y 6 municipios, utilizando la estrategia de Cuidado para el Desarrollo Infantil (CDI) como una herramienta de apoyo para el trabajo con las familias.

4) En el marco de temas emergentes, durante el 2018, Unicef intensificó el trabajo con adolescentes como parte de la iniciativa “Generation Unlimited” (Gen U). “Gen U¨ es una asociación global que tiene como objetivo garantizar que cada joven tenga acceso a la educación, el aprendizaje y empleo decente para el 2030. En Paraguay, 

1) el programa de seguridad vial en los entornos escolares fue desarrollado desde la visión de los adolescentes y en donde ellos fueron los promotores de las ideas y propuestas de mejora: 800 voluntarios formados y 1.800 adolescentes con y sin discapacidad y más de 3.000 niños y niñas de 29 escuelas aprendieron sobre movilidad segura con un enfoque inclusivo desarrollando acciones socioeducativas lúdicas en las calles con el acompañamiento de la Policía Municipal de Tránsito y plantearon sus proyectos de mejora de sus entornos escolares al Municipio de Asunción.

2) la campaña de lectura creó una plataforma para más de 1000 voluntarios adolescentes con la que no se contaba y que representa un giro en la oficina para realizar más programas con enfoque en desarrollo adolescente.

3) el programa de autoprotección de los adolescentes implementado en 4 escuelas para prevenir el abuso sexual. Ellas son: Escuela básica Marangatú Rapé de Asunción; Escuela Básica N 6954 San Cayetano y Escuela Básica N°8109 San José de Capiatá; y la Escuela Básica N° 7630 Nuevo Amanecer de Limpio. La buena recepción por parte de los adolescentes de este programa nos alienta a replicarlo a más centros educativos en el 2019. 

Para el 2019 y en especial para el próximo programa de cooperación 2020-2024 la Oficina debe de fortalecer en todas sus áreas las acciones que viene desarrollando en materia de desarrollo adolescente.

LACR,Peru,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
How to address internal and external intersectoral coordination to accelerate results for children

The theory of change underlying the 2017-2021 Cooperation Programme clearly aims to strengthen a comprehensive approach to the main challenges faced by children and adolescents in Peru. It seeks to ensure that policies and programmes for them are concurrent, (in other words, that they address the same subject), complementary (in other words, they work to enhance different dimensions of human development), and recurrent, ensuring high exposure to interventions. To do so, horizontal (inter-agency) and vertical coordination (between national and sub-national levels) must be strengthened. Internally there needs to be intense collaborative work among different programme areas.

UNICEF encouraged this coordination on capacity building efforts to improve the public administration for children, the prevention of violence in early childhood, comprehensive adolescent development and education policy for adolescents. Several lessons have emerged that will help UNICEF to work more systematically and effectively to obtain other outcomes that also require a comprehensive approach.

Practices and main lessons learned 

Practice No. 1: Capacity-building efforts with the public administration for children mainly in budget, planning and programming) in priority geographic areas 
This strategy combined three elements. The first was to: update regional and local planning instruments (development plans and institutional strategic plans of two regional governments and three local governments) to give priority to children and adolescents and to incorporate inter-agency and inter-government coordination as a strategy to achieve their outcomes. The second was to encourage more widespread use of the monetary and non-monetary incentive mechanisms Peru uses to help regional and local governments to achieve social policy outcomes for children and adolescents. To date, those mechanisms have focused more on reducing malnutrition and anaemia and on early child development, and have been effective in aligning the efforts of sectors and levels of government toward those objectives. An opportunity exists to include, comprehensively and in coordination, the goals and indicators associated with the prevention of violence and adolescent pregnancy. The third element was to encourage the definition of two multi-sector budget programmes, which create budget chains of products assigned to different sectors and which, taken together, are destined to achieve a single higher-order result. During 2018, preparations were made to designmulti-sector budget programmes to achieve early childhood development and to combat violence against women and girls.

Main lessons: The identification of the Government’s management tools, especially those created with a comprehensive approach, was key to this work. Those tools included: concerted development plans, strategic institutional plans, monetary and non-monetary incentive mechanisms and multi-agency budget programmes. The Peruvian Government strategically generated knowledge and evidence of its experiences including systematization of existing incentive mechanisms and their outcomes. This systematization can also be used for advocacy purposes, so that good experiences can be applied to topics on the adolescent agenda. It is important to generate technical evidence on the need to comprehensively promote early childhood development and prevention and care regarding violence against girl children and adolescents. It is also important to ensure that this evidence is taken into account by the Ministry of Economy and Finance and that the Ministry defines budgetary mechanisms that stimulate coordinated work between various sectors toward one single objective.

Practice No. 2. Prevention of violence in early childhood 
UNICEF led a process with management and technical teams from the Ministries of Health, Development and Social Inclusion and Women and Vulnerable Populations to incorporate the prevention of violence into national processes to improve comprehensive services for early childhood. This joint planning included health, early childhood development and child protection teams and allowed UNICEF to build a joint vision, design a shared agenda and promote an inter-agency strategy of capacity building, based on the international framework of ‘Nurturing Care for Early Child Development.’ It also brought together officials and providers of protection, health and education services in joint training activities, both at the national and sub-national levels in the priority geographic areas. The collaboration provided participants with knowledge and tools for working with children's parents and caregivers in preventing violence and with knowledge and tools on early childhood development. 

UNICEF developed an intensive advocacy strategy with the protection, health, education and development and social inclusion sectors so that they place more emphasis on UNICEF's priorities of prevention and response to violence against children and adolescents. The health and education sectors increasingly included those priorities. This represented a positive step forward, given that they have resources, political clout and service coverage that reinforce the actions of the protection sector. The foundations have been laid to continue building a multi-agency agenda on prevention of violence. Progress must be made in developing an increasingly clear distribution of responsibilities, leveraging of resources and sustainability of political will. Greater resources and staff allocations and greater specialization in the protection sector are still major challenges in Peru and are priorities for UNICEF.

Main lessons: The internal construction of a shared vision, based on an international framework such as nurturing care, has allowed for greater coherence and more efficient coordination of efforts and resources. Bringing together the officials responsible for programmes and services for early childhood and training them in the application of approaches and methodologies that enable them to alter their daily practices has created inter-agency collaboration, formerly non-existent. Such technical work has to be reinforced with advocacy and lobbying, so that decision makers prioritize the elimination of violence against children.

Practice No. 3: Strengthening capacities to promote integral adolescent development 
The ‘Comprehensive Development of Adolescents’ diploma in Ucayali for the health, education, protection, planning and budget officials of the regional and local governments of Ucayali and civil society representatives involved coordination schemes in three complementary and gradual ways: the first internal to UNICEF, the second among the participants, and the third with counterparts.

Internal articulation was a given from the preparation of the conceptual framework for drafting the diploma in late 2017 and early 2018. The appropriate contents and sequence for the diploma were established based on the experience of the programme staff and the definitions of the Strategy Note on opportunities for adolescents. Participants from different sectors were asked to critically review their practices and break through sector barriers to submit proposals for coordinated comprehensive care for adolescents. Coordination between regional and local levels, between officials and service operators and between all of them and the academic institutions allied with UNICEF for the diploma course (Cayetano Heredia University and Ucayali University) was essential. In 2019, UNICEF will provide technical support for the implementation of proposals designed by the participants regarding protection, education, participation and violence prevention, with the criterion of all programmes maintaining  a comprehensive and inter-sectoral nature.

Main lessons: Establishing a shared vision through drafting the conceptual framework for the development of the diploma, based on a referential framework composed of the strategy paper and the team’s experience, made it possible to gear the results more efficiently to achieving outcomes. Including actors from different sectors in the same training process was a very effective strategy for breaking down their daily practices and developing new ways of doing things. The systematic inclusion of regional, local and national players from the public sector and from academia also proved to be an effective way of bringing together the management of various territorial levels and to encourage better quality interventions, thanks to the complementary action between sectors (academia, public sector and international cooperation).

Practice No. 4: Construction of the education policy for adolescents 
In 2018, UNICEF promoted the definition of an education policy for the comprehensive development of adolescents. Multiple sectors participated in organizing talks and created a technical committee on secondary education that is working toward establishing adolescent policy as a priority in the agendas of multiple players in the education sector (including the Ministry of Education, CNE, Foro Educativo and UNESCO).

Synthesis of lessons learned from internal and external liaison to accelerate results for children

UNICEF needs to identify and reinforce public administration mechanisms and tools with a comprehensive approach and expand their use to other issues related to guaranteeing child rights.  

It is important to continue producing technical evidence tosupport  the recommendations made by UNICEF. Such evidence encourages officials and service operators from different sectors and levels of government to participate in building a common vision on the outcomes they wish to achieve. 

The creation of a critical mass of actors from various sectors and levels of government in joint training procedures has been useful. This collaboration is geared to reaching a better understanding of human rights, gender and intercultural perspectives and to developing competences for the comprehensive care of children and adolescents.

Programmes should involve more than one sector, include coordination among the teams working in the priority geographic areas, and consolidate a common perspective of the definitions, strategies and specific programme commitments and the way in which they are implemented. This process will involve conducting a more in-depth, two-phase annual planning process: the planning of each programme area and the review, integration, negotiation and consolidation of plans for each outcome, prior to final approval. Such planning integrates the national team and teams of consultants in the priority areas and ensures consistency and horizontal and vertical coordination.

Challenges 

The sector-type design of the Government and the sector approach in budget programme design pose challenges to the collaborative approach described above. There will also be challenges posed by the turnover of all regional and local authorities in January 2019.
There are also internal challenges to advancing inter-sector liaison. UNICEF hopes to move forward in 2019 to ensure that secondary education and health services are consolidated as coordinated platforms for comprehensive services (complementary, concurring on the same subjects and sustainable). 






"
LACR,Uruguay,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"

Uruguay has the potential to become a laboratory for UNICEF to test and model initiatives that very quickly can be scaled up nationally and then replicated in other countries and regions. Uruguay Grows With You, a programme for the most excluded children under the age of five,was imported from Chile and adapted to the local context in 2013. In six years, Uruguay Grows With You became a national policy, reaching 100 per cent of the most vulnerable children under five. The UNICEF Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean identified the preparation of the Uruguayan protocol on non-custodial sanctions for adolescents who are in conflict with the law as a successful inter-institutional work strategy that should be replicated in other countries in the region.

UNICEF Uruguay plays a crucial role in highlighting issues that affect groups of excluded or vulnerable children in a high income country. Even though the overall poverty rate dramatically decreased (from 40 per cent in 2004 to 8 per cent in 2017), there were still a disproportionate number of children and adolescents living in poverty (15 per cent). That number was even higher among afro-descendent children and adolescents (26 per cent).  

Matters of concern for UNICEF Uruguay include issues such as eating habits and obesity, non-communicable diseases, bullying and mental health issues that affect adolescents. UNICEF Uruguay is also concerned with the social and cultural acceptance of institutionalization of children (Uruguay ranks third in Latin America and the Caribbean in the number of children living in care institutions per capita), Other areas that have been identified for action include: high dropout rates in secondary education (only 42 per cent of students graduate from secondary school); high prevalence of violent disciplinary methods used with children and adolescents; and emerging issues such as migration and violence and discrimination among peers. 

In a final assessment of the ‘Trato bien’ campaign, families interviewed described the messages as challenging and thought-provoking. Findings showed that the campaign messages succeeded in creating empathy among the target audience and that parents and caregivers had a positive opinion on the alternatives to violent child rearing practices proposed by the campaign. Families interviewed also said they had not accessed the tools for appropriate child parenting practices in the website www.tratobien.org. In 2019, UNICEF will design strategies to better target the audience by preparing messages that take into consideration factors such as the children’s’ ages and suburban/urban settings. 

UNICEF developed a partnership to build the capacities of staff at the National Human Rights Institution and accompany the Institution to monitor adolescents held in detention and children and adolescents in care institutions, temporary protection centres and psychiatric facilities. This allowed UNICEF to interact with children and adolescents in extremely disenfranchised situations, to better understand the conditions of the most vulnerable children and adolescents in Uruguay and better assist staff at the National Human Rights Institution and provide support to other child protection institutions. These regular monitoring visits led to the closure of detention centres and residential care centres run by NGOs, the improvement of conditions in protection centres and actions to protect children at risk in residential care. 

The Government continued to design family reunification programmes, but the number of children in institutions did not seem to decrease. This situation might be explained by the fact that some judges order institutionalization measures instead of alternative family-oriented measures; or by the absence of monitoring by judges of the conditions experienced by children and adolescents in residential institutions It might also be explained by a lack of suitable living conditions for parents so that they can receive custody of their children; gaps in the reunification and social protection programmes; or a lack of skilled human resources. In 2019, UNICEF will focus on links between the protection system and social assistance and cash transfer programmes, as well as on supporting the Government to improve de-institutionalization policies. 

Three per cent of the adult population donated to UNICEF’s work in Uruguay and contributed to UNICEF programmes for the most vulnerable children in the world. This shows that the Uruguayan population has a strong social conscience and a high appreciation for UNICEF’s work. Development actors, academics and government officials agree that the social agenda in Uruguay needs to focus on children. In this framework, UNICEF and the Uruguayan Agency for International Cooperation  plan to undertake a study on the added value contributed by UNICEF’s cooperation. The study may provide valuable inputs for the next cooperation programme, and eventually could inform other UNICEF programmes in high income countries.

The results achieved in 2018 in private fundraising and partnerships(both in terms of growth of the number of individual donors and the engagement of companies in corporate social responsibility activities) were notable. One of UNICEF Uruguay’s main challenges for the coming years will be expanding the group of businesses that support its work. Expanding the group of companies that support UNICEF will allow the Organization to incorporate a new type of business leader: young entrepreneurs who run businesses in the areas of technology and innovation and who have peers and networks at regional and global levels. UNICEF also has learned that with a growing number of organizations conducting fundraising campaigns for social purposes in Uruguay, UNICEF needs to gather more in-depth knowledge about the profiles and expectations of potential donors. UNICEF also may need to explore new strategies that complement current work in order to maintain growth. 




"
LACR,Venezuela,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Venezuela is going through a deep political and economic crisis that affects the well-being of children and other vulnerable populations, as well as the ability of UNICEF to fulfil its mandate and commitments. On the latter, for instance, the high level of rotation over the last few years of top officials in key areas (e.g., the Ministries of Health and Education) during the last few years delayed and disrupted planned activities and implementation of agreed strategies. From an economic perspective, prevailing distortions and instability constrain UNICEF’s ability to function smoothly within the work plan, requiring constant adjustments to operational arrangements. All of this is taking place in a context that progressively affects children and increases their vulnerability, increasing the need for and the value of UNICEF’s support.

Faced with the mounting needs of children, UNICEF sharply increased its cooperation for the last two years (2018-2019) of the country programme, as agreed with the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. This meant not only a substantial increase in the financial ceiling for those two years (from US$5.6 million to US$32 million), but also an increase of in-country organizational capacity in terms of human resources and physical presence at the sub-national level (three field offices were established). Additionally, the office strengthened its logistics capability to support partners by providing much-needed supplies to communities and children.  

While this scaling-up was a very challenging undertaking to be implemented in a short timeframe – especially because of the complex context and the internal organizational requirements – the process is progressing and consolidating successfully, facilitated by mechanisms UNICEF has in place for responding to emergencies. It is advisable to maintain and further develop flexibility, capacity to adapt and the use of internal support mechanisms available for unusual circumstances. 

The economic turmoil the country currently faces presents, as noted earlier, great challenges for the effective and efficient operation of the office. For example, hyperinflation discourages service providers and experts from engaging in contractual relations in the local currency, while multiple exchange rates make UNICEF expenditures extraordinarily high when using local currency. The economic distortion also affects the private sector, where the number of reliable service providers and suppliers is in decline. All of this results in continuous operational reprocessing, increasing reliance on procurement of goods and services abroad, and delays in the implementation of activities. It is thus necessary to devise mechanisms and ‘lighter’ operational procedures to address economic restrictions in this context. 

The deep political polarization in the country affects collective efforts to ensure children’s rights and support to the most vulnerable. While one of the roles of civil society is to provide assistance to those in need, usually complementing efforts by the government, their perceived political positioning sometimes results in limited communication between the two, opening space for duplication of efforts, different technical approaches, or imposition of mutual boundaries. This is not in the best interests of right-holders.  

In the context of Venezuela, UNICEF has been able, based on the principles of neutrality and impartiality, to maintain fluid channels of communication and collaboration with Government institutions and civil society organizations. In the context of the current crisis, UNICEF should continue to play this role and further support both sides to build bridges and actively collaborate to benefit children through coordinated efforts.

MENAR,Algeria,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
1. Limited availability of regular,up-to-date data. Limited availability of social sector data remains a constraint for analysing the situation of children in Algeria, as well as for assessing country progress and the impact of UNICEF interventions. The country also lacks up-to-date data on SDG indicators, including the 50 child-related indicators monitored by UNICEF. Monitoring progress against the UNICEF’s CPD 2016-2020 results or UNICEF-related UNDAF achievements would require nationwide social sector surveys. The Government has been committed to implementing the MICS since its inception, and is now conducting fieldwork for the sixth round, with technical and financial support from UNICEF and UNFPA. This initiative will strengthen Algeria’s statistical system for social sectors and for monitoring progress toward the SDGs. Government institutions and development partners recognize the importance of investing in updated data on children, youth, women and families, but the MICS alone is not sufficient for providing regular and frequent data on these populations. Since MICS surveys are implemented every three to five years, they are useful for gauging the long-term impact of social policies. However, the data does not allow for analysis of short-term changes in the situation of children and related policies. In addition to MICS, government partners and UNICEF will need to continue investing resources in strengthening real-time monitoring of the situation of children and adolescents, especially in the wake of public policy reforms and economic shocks. More will have to be done to improve regular administrative data collection systems, and to open avenues for exchange of knowledge, in order as well to make Algeria’s experience known internationally. 

2. Partnership opportunities open the way to enhanced outcomes. UNICEF Algeria is a partner to several Algeria institutions, including: the MoE; Ministry of National Solidarity, Family and Women’s Affairs; Ministry of Health, Population and Hospital Reform; Ministry of Youth and Sports; Ministry of Communication; as well as the ONPPE and the CNES. Despite mutual engagement and support from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the time spent in 2018 developing annual or biannual work plans and obtaining a final partner agreement slowed down implementation. In addition, UNICEF staff devote much time and resources to operational and administrative transactions, hindering their capacity to offer quality technical support to country programme partners. To address these constraints, UNICEF Algeria initiated discussions with the MoE and MoH about how better use could be made of the harmonized approach to cash transfers (HACT), which allows for direct payment and direct cash transfers with government institutions for logistical transactions. This would permit the country programme to focus its limited resources on the provision of high-quality expertise to partners. HACT has been used for years with non-governmental organizations supporting implementation of the humanitarian program in the Sahrawi refugees’ camps, and has proven to be useful and effective.

Other strategic partnerships were developed to support implementation of the country programme. For instance, Triangular and South-South cooperation (TSSC) is a key strategy for the UNICEF Algeria’s ‘social inclusion’ programme. Two such arrangements have been implemented with Latin America countries, the first with Brazil on social protection, and the second with Mexico on multidimensional poverty and public policy evaluation. These two initiatives were discussed in the context of a global UNICEF consultation on TSSC experiences in different countries.  

In Algeria, TSSC was implemented following two different approaches. With Brazil, TSSC was not formalized, but rather based on study missions and participation to international conferences and seminars in Algeria and Brazil. In 2015 a memorandum of understanding was signed between Algeria’s CNES, Mexico’s CONEVAL and UNICEF to support the institutionalization of multidimensional poverty measurement and public policy evaluation in Algeria. The Algerian Government and UNICEF do not have an institutionalized approach for managing TSSC. To strengthen the contribution of TSSC strategy in achieving results, and to increase its effectiveness and impact on children, it is important to develop a common institutional framework with the Government for TSSC projects. This will promote an organized, well-coordinated and a collaborative approach. It will also support mutual positive benefits between TSSC initiatives.  

UNICEF plans to document the two past TSSC experiences involving Algeria, in consultation with the Government and involved partners, to build new foundations for an impactful TSSC benefitting poor and vulnerable children. This process will help the Government and the country office to discuss and share ideas to improve and revitalize their collaboration under this strategy and to develop a more sustained institutional set-up. 

Despite the priority placed on increasing implementation of programmes at the regional and local levels, experience in 2018 has shown that the country programme faced challenges in replicating institutional support at the central level to decentralized levels. The mid-term review planned for early 2019 will be an appropriate forum to reflect on the best ways to equip country programme stakeholders to increase localized interventions by exploring other tools and partnerships with local entities such as municipal and provincial councils.

3. Legal and regulatory framework promoting child rights realization was constrained by delayed operational mechanisms. The significant changes adopted by Algeria to its legal framework have the potential to translate into accelerated improvement for children in the country. The Child Protection Law opens the way for major changes in the organization of social services benefitting children and support for increased cooperation between public and non-governmental entities. This potential was illustrated by the establishment of a standing coordinating committee within ONPPE comprised of 16 ministries and more than 10 non-governmental organizations. Further, the revised Constitution provides for the establishment of a consultative High Youth Council composed of civil society and youth representatives nominated by the Ministry of Youth; 16 representatives of youth living abroad, designated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and officials from 21 ministries and five institutions dealing with youth-related issues. The Council is mandated to formulate recommendations for addressing youth needs and on proposed development in the economic, social, cultural and sports arenas. The newly promulgated Health Law supports national priorities and benefitted from UNICEF Algeria support, in areas such as reducing neonatal mortality and preventing transmittable diseases. The Law also provides for increased attention to adolescent health. However, all these opportunities were constrained by delayed promulgation of operational decrees or slow implementation processes. Meanwhile, it is important that UNICEF continue to work with different national partners involved in child and youth institutions and initiatives by strengthening their capacity to implement interventions within the existing legal framework and standards.

4. Unbalanced progress between social equity monitoring and social protection. The social inclusion programme consists of two components: (1) analysing social equity and 2) promoting child-sensitive social protection. These two areas are coherent and relevant to Algeria’s socio-economic context. However, since the start of the present UNICEF country programme in 2016, work on social equity analysis has progressed more quickly than work on social protection, despite the technical support offered by UNICEF in facilitating South-South cooperation between the Algerian and Brazilian governments on social protection, and a tentative plan to pilot a project to digitalize social assistance monitoring in a disadvantaged area of the country in partnership with the Ministry of National Solidarity. 

One of the lessons learned regarding the social inclusion programme is the need to clarify the focus of UNICEF social protection support to the Algerian Government (which until now has been too broad), in order to achieve tangible and concrete results for children through logic and linked interventions. With the mid-term review of UNICEF Algeria country programme initiated in 2018 with the Government, and the global opportunity to debate the UCG supported by UNICEF, ILO and the Overseas Development Institute, an analytical paper was prepared to recommend a new orientation for the social protection component for the remaining years of the programme cycle (2019-2020). A shift should be made toward strengthening government capacity to analyze and develop a policy option with a robust impact on children, and identifying sustained fiscal resources from ordinary and oil-based taxation systems to fund the policy option selected.  

The first step toward this shift will be Algerian Government participation in the international conference on UCGs planned for 2019 in Geneva. The conference aims to stimulate debate around these grants based on experts’ research and countries’ experiences. The reflection on a possible UCG could be part of the ongoing review undertaken by the Government to transform energy subsidies into targeted transfers to the poorest. Alongside with the technical assistance provided by the World Bank to the Government on the process of subsidies review, UNICEF is well positioned to support the Government in analyzing a child-sensitive social protection option policy such as the UCG. UNICEF’s role will not consist of proposing a specific content for the grants, but rather to support the Government with analytical tools to reach the most appropriate and effective decision for poor and vulnerable children. 

5. Increased efforts to mobilize resources yield modest results. Fund-raising efforts to increase humanitarian interventions for Sahrawi refugees in the Tindouf camps led in 2018 to regular support secured from the European Commission Humanitarian Office and the Italian Government, which was complemented by UNICEF regular resources to ensure the continuity of activities supported by UNICEF Algeria in Tindouf. However, resource mobilization efforts aimed at reinforcing child health and protection interventions and expanding UNICEF’s support to education did not bear fruit. The country office will continue to strengthen this argument and encourage funding designated for strengthening health, education and social systems in the camps. In 2019 special attention will be paid to under-resourced sectoral areas for interventions carried out to support the Algerian Government. Private sector fundraising is an area deserving to be explored, with promising signals from private companies operating in Algeria. However, exploring untapped opportunities would require an assessment of potential support for programme interventions, with support from UNICEF’s private fundraising and partnerships team; the same is true for the pursuit of potential multi-year funding opportunities with bilateral cooperation and other donors.

Building UNICEF Algeria’s private sector partnership engagement is prioritized in the coming year, and a dialogue was initiated with the Government to agree on potential assessment of opportunities. The potential value of UNICEF’s ‘equity brand’ and its status as one of the most trusted organizations globally is an opportunity worth exploring, both in terms of resource mobilization, promotion of child rights and promoting best practices that benefit children and youth. Increased attention to mobilizing UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors, celebrities and supporters is seen as a strategic investment, given their capacity to encourage positive changes favouring children’s rights and support UNICEF’s advocacy for children by amplifying critical issues nationally. UNICEF Algeria’s experience in this area has been positive, and needs to be expanded to a wider range of ambassadors and supporters. 

6. Cross-cutting strategies to maximize the delivery of results. UNICEF Algeria’s country programme document is articulated around inter-sectoral outcomes, promoting involvement with a variety of actors to achieve results. However, preparations for the mid-term review highlighted that this shift should be revisited and better articulated around, and in support of, existing government mechanisms if it is to bear fruit.

Multi-sectoral approaches were promoted to address the complex needs of children, for reinforced coordination across a continuum (from childhood to adulthood) and across sectors (such as child protection, education, youth, health and social policy). This was initiated through support provided to the Government to develop an integrated early childhood policy with the involvement of the ministries in charge of education, social affairs, health and religious affairs. However, the absence of an institutional mechanism to lead the process constitutes a challenge that has not been overcome, leading to the suspension of the activity this year. The anticipated projects requiring multi-sectoral interventions, such as those on prevention and response to violence, will thus require formal arrangements, to prevent delays, in addition to clear theories of change elaborated jointly with key counterparts to agree on anticipated impacts and to design roadmaps agreeable to all.

Finally, ongoing cooperation with United Nations sister agencies has proven fruitful and will be pursued to maximize our common impact on neonatal and maternal mortality, youth engagement and participation and for Algeria’s attainment of the SGDs. 

Looking ahead

These challenges and proposed adjustments will contribute to the exchanges that will take place as part of the country programme mid-term review scheduled early 2019, under the strong leadership of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and involving UNICEF experts and country programme partners. The discussions will also build on the recommendations of the gender review carried out by UNICEF Algeria in 2018.

MENAR,Djibouti,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"La théorie de changement et le cadre des résultats qui sous-tendent le programme pays 2018-2022 prévoient dans un premier lieu des investissements dans trois domaines à travers les différents secteurs. Selon l’analyse de la situation effectuée avant l’élaboration du programme pays, ces trois domaines sont considérés comme des déterminants critiques des changements dans l’accès aux services de qualité et l’adoption de comportements favorables à la survie, au développement et à la protection des enfants par les familles:

i) Le renforcement du cadre politique, stratégique et la coordination (environnement favorable) ;
ii) Le renforcement de l’offre de services en termes de qualité et couverture (offre des services) ;
iii) Le renforcement de la demande des services et l’abandon de normes sociales néfastes (demande).

Ces déterminants sont exprimés à travers les 12 produits qui contribuent aux 3 effets programmatiques relatifs à i) la survie de l’enfant ; ii) l’éducation et le développement des adolescents et iii) la protection sociale et la protection de l’enfant. Selon la théorie de changement, c’est en adressant les trois déterminants que les effets du programme pays concernant l’accès aux services de qualité et l’adoption des bonnes pratiques au niveau des familles seront réalisés.

Après cette première année de mise en œuvre, la théorie de changement semble toujours être valable dans le contexte de Djibouti. Ceci est sans doute dû au fait qu’il n’y a pas eu de changement significatif dans le contexte de programmation depuis l’élaboration du programme de coopération.
Les principaux défis auxquels la mise en œuvre du programme de coopération a été confronté sont en 2018 sont i) la disponibilité limitée de données fiables pour appuyer la programmation et la prise de décision ; ii) les mécanismes de coordination faibles ou absents dans plusieurs secteurs clé et iii) le processus de décentralisation qui n’est pas encore opérationnel dans un contexte où plusieurs partenaires gouvernementaux ont des faibles capacités de supervision et suivi sur le terrain.
Concernant la disponibilité des données, l’absence de données d’enquête à jour sur les indicateurs clés de la situation des enfants depuis 2012 pose un défi considérable d’un côté pour le suivi des progrès vers l’atteinte des Objectifs de développement durable (ODD) et les autres objectifs nationaux de développement et de l’autre côté représentent un obstacle pour la prise de décision basée sur des évidences. Les systèmes administratifs produisent des données de qualité variable qui ne sont pas systématiquement partagées en temps opportun. Par conséquent, des approches de planification fondées sur des données probantes ne sont pas encore systématiquement adoptées par les partenaires gouvernementaux. En 2019, l’UNICEF appuiera la conduite de l’enquête SMART en partenariat avec le Ministère de la Santé et la Direction de la Statistique et des Etudes Démographiques afin de produire des données à jour sur la malnutrition. De plus, en concertation avec les autres partenaires au développement, l’UNICEF continuera à plaider pour la planification d’une enquête couvrant de façon globale les indicateurs de bien-être de l’enfant dans les années à venir. Finalement, dans chaque secteur, les programmes appuieront les systèmes d’information sectoriels afin de renforcer la qualité et la complétude des données ainsi que les capacités d’analyse.
Les mécanismes de coordination sectoriels entre partenaires bien qu’existants au niveau conceptuel, ne sont pas fonctionnels dans la majorité des secteurs, avec les exceptions notables de l’éducation et de la protection sociale. Par conséquent, les actions des différents intervenants gouvernementaux et des partenaires techniques et financiers souffrent parfois d’un manque de coordination et il y a un risque réel de duplication des actions, notamment dans les secteurs ou domaines qui attirent l’intérêt de beaucoup d’acteurs. En outre, l’absence de mécanismes de coordination entraine dans certains secteurs ou sous-secteurs un vide ou un manque de clarté en termes de leadership sur des thématiques données. En réponse à cette situation, l’UNICEF continuera en 2019 à participer activement aux groupes sectoriels qui existent et à plaider sous le leadership de la Coordinatrice Résidente pour l’établissement des autres groupes de coordination.

Djibouti a entamé un processus de décentralisation, cependant, le transfert des compétences vers les collectivités locales n’est pas encore effectif dans tous les domaines et n’est pas toujours accompagné d’un renforcement des ressources financières et humaines qui permettraient aux collectivités locales de jouer pleinement leur rôle. Ceci se traduit en de capacités limitées au niveau des collectivités locales pour offrir des services sociaux de base aux citoyens avec la qualité requise (tels que l’enregistrement des naissances). De plus, la faiblesse des mécanismes de suivi et de supervision dans les ministères sectoriels empêche le suivi des programmes et l’encadrement du personnel sur le terrain. En 2019, l’UNICEF continuera à renforcer les mécanismes de suivi et de supervision dans les ministères sectoriels et veillera à identifier des modalités pour l’engagement des collectivités locales dans la réalisation des droits des enfants à Djibouti.

Quant aux leçons apprises, en 2018 le bureau a fait face à une situation d’interruption prolongée des relations de travail avec un ministère. Dans l’absence d’un plan de travail signé, il était impossible pour l’UNICEF de continuer les activités en partenariat avec ce ministère, entrainant un risque d’une dégradation de la situation des enfants. Néanmoins, après une analyse de l’environnement programmatique et une évaluation des risques, le bureau a pu conclure un partenariat avec une ONG nationale, l’Union Nationale des Femmes Djiboutiennes (UNFD), afin d’étendre les activités de prévention à travers des interventions visant un changement de comportement au niveau des ménages, de mobilisation sociale et engagement communautaire. Ceci a permis non seulement de combler un fossé, mais aussi d’élargir le partenariat avec l’UNFD qui continuera à contribuer à la réalisation des droits de l’enfant au niveau communautaire pendant les années à venir.
Pour ce qui est de la réponse à l’urgence, la leçon apprise pour 2018 porte sur l’importance de la mise en place des accords stand-by avec des ONG qui peuvent être activés très rapidement en cas de situation humanitaire aigue. Etant donné que le plan de préparation à l’urgence de l’UNICEF Djibouti pour 2018 était focalisé sur la situation humanitaire chronique, le bureau a dû passer du temps pour élaborer des accords avec des ONGs dans le cadre de la réponse au cyclone Sagar. Sur base de cette expérience, l’UNICEF veillera à prioriser pour le premier trimestre de 2019 le développement de partenariats « stand-by ». Ceci permettra un déploiement plus rapide des interventions sur le terrain en cas d’urgence.

Lessons learned

Leveraging innovation to enhance UNICEF programme results and private sector partnership engagement 

The assessment of the in-country fundraising portfolio potential conducted in 2017 indicated a growing interest among private sector partners (PSP) in engaging with UNICEF on innovation and entrepreneurship related initiatives.  

Hence, in 2018 UNICEF Egypt ran a one-year modelling in collaboration with the UNICEF Office of Innovation in headquarters. The modelling aimed at developing and testing scalable mechanisms to mobilize start-ups for children. During 2018, UNICEF Egypt promoted the UNICEF Innovation Fund - a global venture fund that supports technology start-ups to innovate for children with up to US$100,000 - to incentivize local start-up companies to work for children in alignment with UNICEF Egypt’s programme priorities. Eighty-two locally developed innovations for children were submitted; the highest number of submissions per country (30 per cent of global submissions). Following this success, UNICEF Egypt shared a report including a detailed guide for country offices to engage start-ups locally using the Innovation Fund. In December, UNICEF selected its first Egyptian start-up company for the Innovation Fund. This was an Internet-of-Things (IoT) start-up that uses technology to monitor water quality in real-time. By investing in this technology, UNICEF aims to support programmatic work in Goal Area 4 of the Strategic Plan – Every child lives in a clean and safe environment. 

In addition to engaging the innovation community locally, UNICEF Egypt explored all previous investments in open-source technology solutions by the Global Innovation fund for localization and integration into the country programme. The collaboration with the Office of Innovation enabled access to 60 innovative technology solutions that have been supported by and/or piloted in a UNICEF programme country. These are all solutions that are licensed as creative commons and that are free to edit, use and redistribute. Two solutions have been identified and agreed upon with the Government and will be piloted in 2019 to support programmatic work: 
Rapid Pro: A real-time communication platform to be used as a two-way communication channel to reach the most vulnerable, focusing on parents of children aged below 5 years; 
UPSHIFT: A designthinking-based curriculum to be used to help children improve problem solving and entrepreneurial skills. 

To mobilize start-up companies to innovate for children, and to widen the scope of PSP engagement, UNICEF Egypt designed a model where accelerators would implement a customised support programme for start-up companies with innovative solutions that can benefit children and young people. This initiative aims at incentivising the private sector to systematically support open source innovation; a milestone to enlarge the pool of technology solutions for children and a first-of-its-kind task that asserts UNICEF’s leading role in advancing innovation for good.  

In collaboration with the UNICEF Regional Office for the Middle East and North Africa and the UNICEF offices in Tunisia, Lebanon, and Jordan, the Regional Accelerator Initiative was launched. It received 11 proposals from the strongest implementing partnercandidates in MENA. The first cycle of the Accelerator will be launched in 2019 with the financial support of corporate partners.  

In 2019 and beyond, UNICEF will continue to leverage the rapid growth of start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises in Egypt to improve results for children in all relevant programme areas. Start-ups have shown great potential to reduce programme implementation cost and/or improve programme results. Moreover, they have shown commitment toward using technology to improve the lives of children and young people, as did the major corporate partners. In addition, UNICEF Egypt will continue to collaborate with colleagues in other countries sharing lessons learned to accelerate innovation for children.

 Engaging in Egypt's education reform process
Egypt is undergoing a bold and complex education reform process, including transformations in curricula, technical and vocational education, teacher professional development, assessment systems, and use of technologies. While such reform is very much needed, its implementation is accompanied by challenges related to scale, governance and coordination.  

UNICEF’s key challenge in education programming has been to position its ongoing and expanding portfolio effectively within the education reform process. This has in the light of the growing demand for technical support by the MOETE as well as the strong interest of development partners to increasingly invest in education through UNICEF. It was clear that project-based and selective approaches make it difficult to ensure meaningful engagement and measure system-level progress on such ambitious education reform. 

In this context, UNICEF adapted its interventions along the following lines. Firstly, key opportunities to capitalize on and maximize for effective leveraging were identified. UNICEF’s combined work at the local level through equity interventions and at the system level through policy change around quality education (especially through leading the LSCE initiative) was proving fundamental for grounding the reform process and bringing stakeholders on board. Secondly, UNICEF strategically positioned its interventions within the framework of the education reform by developing technical and governance ‘frameworks’ around its key pillars (curriculum, teacher training, assessments, use of ICT, and social engagement) with a view of galvanizing other interventions in a complementary manner. Thirdly, in co-leading the Development Partners Group, UNICEF was very active in engaging development partners around a more coordinated support of the education reform process, using its work on curriculum framework development to pull partners around a more strategic and coherent approach in education development cooperation. 

The engagement along these three lines has proven successful in maximising the effectiveness of UNICEF’s support to the national education reform. Building on the lessons learned from combining local and system level interventions, from strategic positioning and from engaging partners around the reform process, UNICEF will continue to tighten its approach. The relationship between the MoETE and UNICEF will continue to be nurtured towards more systematic, coherent and constructive dialogue to address the challenges in planning and implementation. UNICEF will also use its communication work in Egypt and its intersectoral and multisectoral approaches to education and development to pull diverse stakeholders around the needed social behavioural changes that must accompany the education reform. Finally, UNICEF will continue its engagement with the Development Partners Groupby constituting specific task forces that focus on technical aspects of the education reform.

Building and shaping UNICEF private sector partnerships  
The engagement with the private sector is an emerging priority for UNICEF Egypt. An assessment of the in-country fundraising portfolio potential conducted in 2017 served as basis for UNICEF PSP engagement as well as internal office restructuring. The assessment was instrumental to position UNICEF and allowed the establishment of successful fundraising and partnerships with businesses which showcased the potential of working with UNICEF and the value proposition its brand equity can offer. 

In partnership with the United Nations Global Compact, UNICEF organized roundtables with the private sector focusing on ECD and adolescent empowerment. The roundtable on ECD attracted participation of over 20 companies at the level of Chief Executive Officer or head of sustainability and marketing and led to companies pledging their support to the agenda and agreeing to work closely with UNICEF. 

In 2018, UNICEF established anin-country cause-related marketing partnership with Unilever. Whilst UNICEF’s partnership with Unilever globally has been limited to hygiene promotion, UNICEF Egypt successfully advocated with the corporate partner to broaden the scope in-country by integrating nutrition messaging into the programme. This partnership provided a platform for different sections within UNICEF to work together to develop an integrated campaign and programme. The partnership also provided an opportunity to engage UNICEF national ambassador Donia Samir Ghanem through a public service announcement and lending her voice to a cause close to her heart - nutrition for children. The partnership US$881,639 for UNICEF Egypt in 2018. 

UNICEF Egypt engagement with the private sector in 2018 resulted in funding for the country programme of US$1.1 million and in-kind support worth US$370,000. UNICEF Egypt’s PSP engagement, building on the 2017 market assessment, provided crucial evidence on the potential that the private sector offers and the different types of engagement that UNICEF can pursue. The Unilever experience allowed the building of skills in new areas, such as the activation of behaviour change from the ground-up: using multimedia mobile delivery to reach out to children in schools and within the community. 

Egypt’s growing consumer market provides an opportunity to engage in cause-related marketing which can be at the same time an effective fundraising and advocacy platform, with a reach to the farthest places in the country. Beyond the engagement in PSP, in 2019 UNICEF Egypt will look to establish customer relationship management partnerships with different industries and rally their support to achieving UNICEF’s results. 

Major constraints to programme implementation

Limited availability of up-to-date data on children's rights
The limited availability of social sector data remained a constraint for both the analysis of the situation of children in Egypt as well as to assess the results of the UNICEF interventions on the ground.  

The country faces major challenges in terms of availability of up-to-date data on the SDG indicators: data for just 21 of the 50 child-related indicators monitored by UNICEF are presently available.  

With specific reference to the UNICEF Country Programme in Egypt, monitoring progress against the results requires nationwide social sector surveys. The last national social survey, the Egypt Demographic and Health Survey was undertaken in 2014 and a date for conducting a new one has not yet been agreed upon. This constrains reporting and forces UNICEF to resort to proxy indicators to assess the extent to which results have been achieved. UNICEF will continue supporting the Government in strengthening administrative information systems. In addition, UNICEF will advocate for regular national social sector household surveys, which are required to assess progress in key indicators. 

Security and movement constraints in part of the Sinai Peninsula
Security concerns in North Sinai greatly limit UNICEF interventions in this area. In 2018, UNICEF’s initial plan to expand the civic education programme to new governorates in Sinai was halted due to a ban on interventions. In 2019 and beyond, UNICEF with support from the United Kingdom Government, is commencing implementation of an integrated multi-sectoral project, involving a combination of education and protection interventions in North Sinai. The intervention is crucial as it supports access and quality of education and life skills of vulnerable children and adolescents in isolated communities such as North Sinai, South Sinai and adjacent governorates that host Sinai students. Implementation of this large-scale intervention, as well as of other UNICEF-supported intervention in health and child protection, will face security challenges. UNICEF is working with partners to identify programme delivery and monitoring mechanisms to ensure effective implementation in this challenging environment.

Temporary halting in the recruitment of civil servants
The Government implemented a freeze in recruitment of civil servants as a cost-cutting measure. While this has merit in freeing up State budget resources, it also constrains ongoing programmes and reforms. A case in point is the child protection sector where the reform aiming at building a national child protection system requires recruitment of staff to form a dedicated social services workforce. Furthermore, estimates indicate that as much as 40 per cent of the current workforce might retire from work within the next three to five years, leaving a large staff gap within the civil servants. This issue needs to be addressed for progress to be made in developing and scaling up a national child protection system.  

The freeze also affects other UNICEF-supported interventions such as the establishment of new community schools as part of the EU-funded project aiming at increasing access to education and child protection for at-risk-children. The halting in the recruitment of teachers for new community schools led to UNICEF having to re-programme the EU funds with a shift towards strengthening of existing community-based education. In addition, UNICEF initiated the exploration of alternative funding options through partnerships with NGOs to cover teachers’ salaries and establish community schools for out-of-school children in areas that are currently underserved.

MENAR,Iran,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
During 2018, UNICEF Iran was able to strengthen existing partnerships and cultivate a number of new partnerships, which will help it  to achieve the results laid out in the country programme 2017-2021 and to expand its partnerships for children in the future. An additional three partnerships with private corporations were signed in 2018. UNICEF Iran now has nine official corporate partners. UNICEF Iran also received clearance from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to use its local bank account for domestic fund raising from the public.  

The first-ever partnership with the Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance on issues relating to communication and children and the partnership with the Drug Control Headquarters on children and substance abuse are now fully operational. Additional partnerships with Statistical Centre of Iran on child-specific data and analysis, with the Budget and Planning Organization on Public Finance for Children, and with the Ministry of Sports and Youth on youth and adolescents, were being negotiated and are expected to start in 2019. A new partnership with the Vice Presidency for Science and Technology on Innovation for Children also was negotiated and is expected to start in 2019. The partnership with the Ministry of Interior was renewed and covers, among other areas, cooperation on child-friendly cities, sub-national engagement and emergency preparedness. In 2019, UNICEF Iran will work to further strengthen and develop these partnerships.

While many policies and standards were in place at the national level regarding all areas of child well-being and key indicators at the national level showed sustained progress, some provinces and population groups exhibited higher levels of disadvantage. On the basis of the strengthened partnerships and per the original intent of the country programme 2017-2021, UNICEF Iran intensified discussions with partners to explore the potential for more provincial-level engagement of UNICEF Iran. This would allow UNICEF to provide more targeted support in health, education, social policy and child protection. One example that UNICEF Iran will build on is the child-friendly city initiative, which will be launched in Isfahan in January 2019 and will provide a platform for more sub-national engagement by engaging with municipalities. UNICEF Iran also started to discuss such opportunitieswith relevant ministries in all sectors. Provincial-level engagement will be a priority in 2019.

Multi-sectoral initiatives such as early childhood development, children with disabilities, and adolescents were a priority and UNICEF Iran was able to achieve some important milestones in those areas in 2018. UNICEF organized a high-level conference on children with disabilities and secured partnerships with the major stakeholders in adolescent development and participation. In 2019, UNICEF Iran will focus its efforts on supporting partners to advance cross-sectoral cooperation in those priority areas. This will require putting in place effective mechanisms within the programme team to provide comprehensive, well-coordinated and timely assistance. Since all three of these areas of work are at different stages of discussion at the national level and of engagement with partners, UNICEF Iran will develop dedicated mechanisms for each of them. 

Constraints

The withdrawal of the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and the reinstatement of sanctions have begun to substantially impact UNICEF Iran operations, both directly and indirectly. The sanctions imposed on financial flows into and out of the country affect the capacity of UNICEF Iran to transfer funds needed for programme implementation and office operations into Iran, and affect the capacity of Iranian government partners to transfer funds from Iran for the purchase of vaccines to UNICEF’s Supply Division. The substantial exchange rate fluctuations associated with the reinstatement of the sanctions, as well as the sanctions on shipping to and from Iran, affect UNICEF Iran’s capacity to procure supplies and services required for programme implementation and office operations. The capacity of UNICEF Iran to fundraise locally from the private sector may also be affected by the sanctions.

Through UNICEF Headquarters, UNICEF Iran, together with the other resident agencies of United Nations in Iran, advocated with the United States Treasury to grant OFAC licenses for the United Nations activities in Iran. The UN is actively exploring alternative ways to make financial transfers.

Given the complex socio-political context, negotiations and preparations of workplans and activities sometimes experienced substantial delays. While this is a challenge in terms of programme implementation, it is crucial for UNICEF Iran to continue to focus on building and strengthening its partnerships in close coordination with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The way ahead

In 2018 UNICEF Iran took the lead on developing a technical assistance package to protect the vulnerable during the economic downturn associated with the re-imposition of US sanctions. UNICEF Iran will continue to prioritize this effort in 2019 and work to provide support for real-time monitoring of the situation of children and families and government programmes to mitigate the impact of the downturn on the well-being of children and families. 

Lessons learned will be discussed during the midterm review in 2019. The review will focus on strengthening multi-sectoral work and engagement at sub-national level, as well as on ensuring a focus on the most vulnerable is sufficiently integrated within all programmes. The midterm review also will examine adjustments in terms of program and office structure that may be required to ensure that UNICEF Iran is ready to address challenges effectively during the remainder of the country programme. The expected economic downturn and difficult operating environment and its effects on UNICEF Iran programming and operations will feature prominently in the review. The midterm review discussions for the UNDevelopment Assistance Fund are expected to start in April. The UNICEF Iran midterm review will be planned in a way that it can feed into that process.

"
MENAR,Iraq,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
As levels of violence in Iraq declined, the humanitarian situation in Iraq has stabilized since the end of 2017. UNICEF Iraq shifted focus from a fast-moving service delivery at scale, to review its systems and processes and streamline operational strategies and approaches, consolidate gains made in previous years, and review the existing structure in light of the 2019 context.

Political uncertainty in Iraq in 2018 remained however. Time frames for UNICEF Iraq policy interventions and support to legislative reform had to be lengthened to allow for formation of the new Government, which was not complete as of December, and for new ministers to be appointed. The continued autonomy of the Kurdistan Region was considered when introducing new measures. The push for independence influences the region’s willingness to engage in joint processes in national policy or in laws with regional variations.

Partnership and engagement with the Government, stakeholders and communities promoted local and national ownership, supported results, and provided handover and exit strategies in programming. Strong engagement of line ministries enhanced sustainability and buy-in of interventions. For example, responding to immediate, emergency child-protection needs and supporting child protection system-building werepreviously two, separate work strands due to the exigencies of working in a large-scale humanitarian crisis. In 2018, they were considered complimentary with system-building actions (such as improving social workforce capacity) and development of standards for case management approached as processes parallel to emergency assistance. 

With more time to plan, improvements in security and fewer non-government organization partners in the country, UNICEF identified and encouraged integrated and multi-sector partnerships. Attempts were made to identify non-government organization partners with relevant geographic presence and technical capacity to support delivery of interventions that met the multi-sector needs of children and caregivers.  

Challenges faced included identifying partners with sufficient technical capacity across UNICEF programme areas - for example, a partner with sufficient WASH capacity may not have adequate experience in child protection programming. Capacity-building, including UNICEF direct technical support and guidance, became a pre-requisite in the design of each programme document. With UNICEF Iraq’s increased focus on transparent selection of partners through open calls for expressions of interest, the time needed to select, design the intervention, and move through internal quality assurance mechanisms such as the partnership review committee, was initially under-estimated and had to be extended. 

UNICEF Iraq increasingly supports programming that builds the capacity of national partners, in line with commitments made under the Grand Bargain. In 2018, UNICEF channelled more than $40 million through national actors, of which around $US2.5 million wasfor services contracted through national private sector actors, in particular for faster, more efficient humanitarian water trucking services for people living in recently conflict-affected areas. This was an increase of more than 10 per cent of programming supporting national actors compared to 2017.  

UNICEF Iraq took the initiative under the United Nations operations management team to set common long-term agreements between United Nations agencies, improving the United Nations Country Team capacity to deliver as one. UNICEF itself executed 79 per cent of local procurement actions in 2018 through long-term agreements, to shorten delivery time and support the local economy. 

On a smaller scale, the UNICEF Iraq country office improved integration for cost-efficiencies by building on existing programme agreements with non-government partners in specific cases, such as distribution of winter clothing kits. By negotiating with partners who had existing presence in internally-displaced person and refugee camps, distributions of clothes took place at no additional cost to UNICEF, maximizing resources available to procure needed items, rather than on in-country logistical costs. 

UNICEF’s largest contributors in Iraq continued to be government donors supporting humanitarian response, including ECHO, Italy, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Qatar and the United States. The UNICEF National Committees made significant contributions in Iraq in 2018, with flexible multi-year humanitarian funds facilitating swift and more predictable response to children’s needs. Significant contributions from the Iraq Humanitarian Fund were also received. 

UNICEF Iraq built strong donor relations through proactive engagement, including facilitation of field visits by donors to UNICEF projects, meetings with donors in-country and outside Iraq, and regular sharing of monthly situation reports for both Syrian refugee and Iraq internal displacement crises. At the close of 2017, it was anticipated that most of funding for 2018 would be channelled through the United Nations Recovery and Resilience Programme, in support of early recovery and resilience work. However, most resources received by UNICEF Iraq continued to be in support of the humanitarian agenda, as has been the case since 2014. Nonetheless, UNICEF Iraq continued to engage donors in strategic dialogue on the humanitarian-development nexus to support sustained and positive change for children. 

As UNICEF Iraq moves into the final year of its current Country Programme, preparations for the new Country Programme 2020-2024 are underway. The programme monitoring team’sreview and a strategic moment of reflection were conducted in late 2018 to take stock of progress, challenges, and lessons learned, and to contribute to the strategic thinking that will inform direction of the new Country Programme. The development of the UNICEF 2020-2024 Country Programme coincides with the development of the new UNDAF in Iraq, and this offers an opportunity for UNICEF to strategically influence the UNDAF to ensure inclusion of children’s needs. 

The journey taken by UNICEF Iraq since 2014 was challenging in many ways. The impact of crisis on children in Iraq cannot be underestimated, and there remains much work to be done. Moving forward, areas to consider include upstream advocacy, such as policy reform to encourage government resources for child-focused priorities; taking programmes toscale and reaching children in systematic and sustainable ways; and investment in national capacity. As Iraq decentralizes authority to governorate levels, UNICEF will need to maintain central-level influence to ensure resources are allocated to the most under-served children whether in cities, towns, or in the countryside; as well as maintaining presence and focus at decentralized levelsto increase knowledge of children’s needs and capacity to meet them. There is a push to work with adolescents and young people as partners to create programmes that give power and voice to one of the largest demographic groups in Iraq. And convergence through multi-sector interventions with partners will serve as platforms for the ‘whole child’, leveraging UNICEF expertise in service delivery, evidence generation, and advocacy to make change for children in Iraq.

MENAR,Jordan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
In 2018, UNICEF Jordan focused on shifting from an almost exclusively refugee-related response to a broader vulnerability approach and to reaching children based on their vulnerabilities, rather than nationality, through sustainable, national systems. This required a change from a vertical, Syria-crisis-specific response to a comprehensive, systems-strengthening approach. The vulnerability approach came about through key lessons learned from the previous country programme, including the need to promote the resilience of national systems and communities to meet the needs of the country’s vulnerable children. The need to work through national systems was echoed in the evaluations of the infant and young child feeding programme (2016), Ma’an campaign on violence against children (2017) and child protection case management (2018). 

Throughout its Syria crisis response, UNICEF Jordan developed a network of national NGO and community-based organization partners, working alongside international NGO partners. The goal of this approach, agreed across the international community, was to transfer knowledge and skills from international to national NGOs, increasing cost-effectiveness, sustainability and responsiveness to local needs. By the end of 2018, this shift was nearly complete. Five international NGOs were working with UNICEF Jordan outside of camps, down from 10 the year before. They were working alongside 13 national NGOs. Undertaking this shift without disrupting services for the most vulnerable children required substantial staff time and resources, with a particular focus on increasing the technical expertise and project management skills required for local partners to take ownership of the response. 

UNICEF Jordan strengthened its collaboration with its government partners and reached out to new ministries such as the Ministry of Labour. UNICEF Jordan increasingly focused on institutionalizing programming within line ministry partners. For example, training and coaching was provided to the Ministry of Youth to embed life skills education into its network of 150 youth centres. Agreements were also reached with the Ministry of Education to institutionalize non-formal education and the Nashatati programme. Based on lessons learned from the shift to national NGOs, UNICEF Jordan will focus its capacity building efforts to enable partner ministries to bring programmes to scale across the country. 

The requirement to maintain humanitarian services in camps and at the north-eastern border (at Rukban) also required disproportionately high levels of staff time and funding. The majority of flexible resources received in 2018 were used to meet those humanitarian needs, including the provision of water and health services at Rukban, and WASH services and schooling in Syrian refugee camps. Achievements in 2018 included the operationalization of the water and wastewater networks in Za’atari camp; the shift to direct implementation of Makani centres in camps by Syrians themselves; and handing over vaccination and school health services in Za’atari and Azraq camps to the Ministry of Health. All those programmes are expected to deliver dividends in terms of cost savings, local ownership and sustainability in 2019.

In 2018 UNICEF Jordan’s advocacy efforts for the vulnerable population in Rukban focused on two major areas: refugee access to basic social services and their safe return to Syria. Since March 2018, UNICEF Jordan played a lead role in advocating for access to health services for refugees living in Rukban. Thanks to persistent advocacy efforts, as of November 2018, an average of 250 patients per day received treatment at the United Nations-supported clinic. Strong advocacy efforts were focused on ensuring children under 5 years old who were in critical condition could be referred to a hospital in Jordan. Although UNICEF’s advocacy targeting the Jordanian government and donor community yielded tangible results in the end, the process took a significant amount of staff time and effort due to the complex political dynamics. 

UNICEF’s accountability to affected populations was ensured by mobilizing 32 youth volunteers in Rukban to increase transparency, feedback, complaints and monitoring. Those volunteers acted as UNICEF’s eyes and ears and sent daily feedback to UNICEF Jordan’s humanitarian team to flag issues related to child protection, health, water and sanitation. Those volunteers were trained to undertake rapid assessments and subsequently were engaged in data collection for a nutrition assessment and post-distribution monitoring covering more than 10,000 people. This Rukban volunteer mechanism showcased a model to position vulnerable populations not only as service recipients but also as active change agents empowered to share the needs of the vulnerable on the ground. 

While ever growing needs of the refugee population persisted, UNICEF Jordan faced an uncertain funding situation that required it to reposition and rationalize programmes based on donors’ funding prospect and priorities. To address immediate needs, funding support was analysed constantly while strategies to engage current and potential donors were developed in parallel to continue reaching the most vulnerable children in Jordan. 

The vulnerability approach was acknowledged as a way to mitigate the risk of growing tensions within communities by leveraging service delivery platforms to promote social cohesion and enable interaction among children from diverse backgrounds. The evaluation of the first phase of the Ma’an campaign (2009-2016) on violence against children noted that the Ma’an campaign created national acceptance and momentum on reducing violence against children in schools. The evaluation also noted the link between social cohesion and violence, and the need for the Syria crisis response to benefit the wider Jordanian community.  

In 2018, UNICEF Jordan completed a study defining what social cohesion means for children, that is: a child feels an environment is safe, happy and comfortable, and they can build bridges with other children. A tool to monitor social cohesion for children will be piloted in 2019, and the Ma’an campaign online survey – through which more than 600,000 children report on levels of violence in schools on a monthly basis – was expanded to track the incidence of bullying.

Children with disabilities were frequently left out of services and programmes. In 2017, the Government of Jordan passed a Law on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. A plan was being developed to make Jordan fully inclusive by 2027. Making this plan a reality has been constrained by the current funding environment as well as the social stigma and discrimination faced by children and people with disabilities. UNICEF Jordan worked with Ministry of Social Development to establish a multidisciplinary team of professionals to provide screening and early intervention services for children with disabilities and developmental delays. Through a pilot project, 150 children (42 per cent girls) received home-based early intervention services and assistive devices. While highly effective, this approach needs to be amended to be more cost-effective. UNICEF and the Ministry of Social Development utilized the evidence generated from this programme to inform the scalable programme to reach more children across Jordan.  

Some UNICEF Jordan programmes were relatively successful in engaging children with disabilities, including the Hajati cash transfer programme (12.5 per cent) and certified non-formal education (6.7 per cent for Catch Up and 4.8 per cent for Drop Out). Overall, further sustained funding will be required to provide the targeted outreach, frontline worker training, transportation and physical infrastructure upgrades required to ensure children with disabilities can enjoy all services alongside their peers. Going into 2019, UNICEF set a target of 5 per cent of all beneficiaries being children and people with disabilities. 

Stigma and discrimination also continued to be a barrier for children from the marginalized ethnic Jordanian minority groups referred to as the Dom. Three Makani centres that serve high percentages of Dom children reported having 37, 44 and 78 per cent children with functional difficulties. Questions were asked in Arabic (not the first language for many Dom) and the historical stigma around the Dom and hygiene led to children being recorded as having difficulties in self-care. Staff from those centres were re-trained. The lesson from this exercise is that systematic efforts must be made to counteract the discrimination at each stage of an intervention. In 14 schools enrolling high numbers of Dom children, UNICEF Jordan engaged school staff, students and families to support 1,336 Dom children to enrol and stay in school. School-based mobilization activities, advocacy and case management activities facilitated their access to formal and certified non-formal education, with plans to further support the Dom community through UNICEF Jordan’s Ma’an campaign against violence in schools in 2019.

"
MENAR,Lebanon,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
UNICEF Lebanon went through an intense mid-term review process in 2018, assessing the Government of Lebanon/UNICEF Country Programme for 2017-2020. The review focused on the objectives and structures put in place by UNICEF to ensure equitable outcomes for the poorest, most disadvantaged and hardest-to-reach children and families, and by working with partners to address policy, systems, and access to and demand for services at national, subnational and community levels. The current programme aims to respond to immediate humanitarian needs and at the same time, to build resilience to further shocks and address development deficits. One of the main conclusions was that key challenges faced by disadvantaged children and their families had not yet been sufficiently mitigated, and that multiple vulnerabilities and poverty had also increased. Some of these vulnerabilities include increasing poverty levels, household debts and limited livelihood opportunities. These are pushing Palestinian and Syrian refugee families, as well as Lebanese poor families, to resort to negative coping strategies that are harmful to children, such as child labour, child marriage, dropping out of school and decreasing food consumption. This has necessitated a change to the evidence base used for analysis, strategic thinking, planning, and impact assessment. 

The most significant change that stemmed from this learning in 2018 was the need for a more significant level of strategic thinking regarding longer-term solutions. In its eighth year, the humanitarian response has seen plateauing of donor commitments and expectations for additional commitments to wane in the coming three to five years. Although institutional development, capacity building and policy change have been part and parcel of the overall approach adopted by all sections and sectors, there is still a clear need for sustainable humanitarian solutions and for a methodology shift to allow for greater ownership by national stakeholders and systems. These solutions need to incorporate and reflect international norms and standards, including a focus on child specific vulnerabilities and needs, inclusion, and other relevant conventions that the Government of Lebanon is a signatory to. The Theory of Change exercise undertaken in mid-2018 allowed for a revisiting of the strategic thinking in each of UNICEF Lebanon’s programme areas resulting in Rolling Work Plans for 2019-2020 that will operationalize this new approach. 

The increased focus on sustainable solutions and shift to development has also raised important issues, and hence lessons, regarding the nature of partnerships that UNICEF Lebanon is engaged in. For more sustainable solutions as mentioned above, a greater reliance on, and building capacity of, local and national partners as opposed to international organizations is one obvious lesson that will be more deliberately pursued in 2019. In addition, a more significant level of partnerships with local level duty bearers (including local authorities, civil society organizations, community-based organizations, and youth groups) will be sought with an equal, if not greater, emphasis on rights holders. Partnerships of this nature at community and local levels will remain a focus of the UNICEF Lebanon’s overall approach and programmatic methodology.

The review also re-emphasized the need for a key shift to take place to promote programme integration as a multi-sectoral approach to address the complex needs of disadvantaged girls and boys and their families. This requires better coordination across a continuum (from childhood to adulthood) and across sectors (such as water and sanitation, child protection, education, gender and social policy). While vertical integration has already been initiated by UNICEF Lebanon (as exemplified by the development of child protection policies for the Ministry of Health and for the Ministry of Education), horizontal integration is still necessary, with coordination and referral of the multi-sectoral gateways - municipalities, schools, public health centres, social development centres, and civil society organizations as well as duty bearers and children’s participation in certain municipalities. UNICEF Lebanon changed its offices’ structure accordingly during the latest programme budget review and spent a significant amount of time planning for this new working modality for field offices. The experience of the office-wide shift is expected to be documented and progress regularly monitored by the country management team.

An additional outcome of the review process was the glaring realization of the inadequacy of the incorporation of gender and disabilities in the programmatic approach reflected in the workplans. The concern thus far had been to ensure that UNICEF Lebanon’s activities and reporting were cognizant and inclusive of both issues. In 2019, the approach will be refined to ensure both issues are incorporated more meaningfully and explicitly in the entire programmatic cycle, starting from analysis, to planning, monitoring and evaluation. Implementation of the relevant tools such as the gender programmatic review is an essential step to guide the preparation of the next country programme.

There is also a clear need to use the evidence regularly collected for child and gender focussed analyses to more effectively demonstrate and communicate results and impact, advocate for children with various duty bearers, document lessons learnt and share knowledge about the situation of children. Some of the evidence that has been generated are the Vulnerability Assessment for Syrian Refugees with WFP and UNHCR, the UNICEF Household survey, the upcoming multiple indicator cluster survey and the neighbourhood profiles with UN Habitat. UNICEF Lebanon initiated an office-wide Advocacy Strategy and a Knowledge and Innovation Strategy for roll-out in 2019 to follow-up on this recommendation.

An important contribution to global knowledge on social assistance in protracted humanitarian contexts was the publishing in 2018 of the Min Ila impact evaluation, produced by UNICEF’s Office of Research and the American Institute for Research. This study provided useful evidence relating to the impact of direct cash transfers on child well-being and child development, including education spending, improved health, and better food security. In addition, it provided evidence of rising optimism among children and youth who were part of the programme’s caseload. The findings of the evaluation supported the design of a reduced and integrated social assistance programme for Lebanese and non-Lebanese children, following the same principles. One other key lesson from this UNICEF Min Ila cash-based programme was the need to effectively coordinate cash transfer programmes to promote discussion and evidence, ultimately reducing transaction costs with UNHCR and WFP, while still allowing flexibility for all agencies to determine the best approach to provide cash transfers in the interests of beneficiaries. As a result, a joint statement by the heads of UNHCR, WFP, UNICEF and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance (OCHA) was published in December, promoting the importance of working in a coordinated manner, as is done under the Lebanon One Unified Inter-Agency System for e-cards (LOUISE) platform. This approach enhances coordination whilst at the same time upholding the individual agencies’ reach and support to refugees’ multidimensional needs.

Due to the Syrian crisis, UNICEF consistently had to raise significant levels of donor funding to cover the needs of children and their families in Lebanon. The programme funding used has therefore increased about five-fold since 2013, from US$56 to US$335 million in 2018. Lebanon is, however, a middle-income country and as such, the country programme received the unchanged minimal core budget allocation. The longer-term donors’ humanitarian funds have furthermore become increasingly earmarked, with little interest to support organizational cost recovery. UNICEF Lebanon’s minimal cross-sectoral margin costs have thus made local operations highly volatile and were unable to cover core activities or mitigate the risk of shortfalls. Ad-hoc funds received from UNICEF Headquarters to reduce those risks have been directly allocated to programme implementation and have effectively assisted UNICEF in Lebanon during the past year.

MENAR,Libya,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
The year under review was important for UNICEF Libya, with significant programme scale-up underpinned by the return of the international staff from Tunisia to Tripoli, after operating remotely for close to four years. Due to security constraints, UNICEF has moved its office from downtown Tripoli to a private compound in the outskirts of Tripoli where the UNCT had established temporary offices and accommodation for international staff. Opening an office in the east was an important planning consideration during 2018; in line with the principle of neutrality, UNICEF and other members of the UNCT have sought regular presence in the east. Currently, the United Nations plans to open a hub in Benghazi at the beginning of 2019. Access to the south was restricted throughout the year as a result of security concerns for United Nations missions. 

Operating in Libya remains challenging; numerous security, logistical and administrative constraints impact the effective delivery of programmes to the most vulnerable children and their families. Some of the challenges included poor Internet connectivity, limited availability of armoured vehicles, movement restrictions due to insufficient security personnel and limited support for the expanded human resource structure.

The Libyan context and geography also constrained programme delivery. Most people in need are in urban areas, mainly in the western and eastern regions of Libya, where tribal violence and armed groups continue to displace families as well as hindering access in the south. The security, administrative constraints and arrangements pose a challenge for rapid emergency response in different areas, especially with regard to access to children on the move. The limited number of local and international CSOs operating in Libya is a further limitation. In 2018 UNICEF started to use the services of third-party monitors to gain greater presence throughout the country. UNICEF’s third-party monitors operated from Zintan, Zuara, Albeida, Benghazi and Sabha. Given Libya’s insecurity and changing operational environment, it has been essential to maintain flexible human resources and office structures that can operate from both Libya and Tunisia as an important component of the business continuity plan. 

The 2013–2014 Country Programme Document was designed for a stable, high-middle-income country with a strong central government. Political events in 2011 and 2014 radically altered Libya’s landscape. As a result, UNICEF’s previous strategy and its modest budget, characterized by limited upstream support and humanitarian action, were insufficient to respond to the new context and provide the Government with requested support. Reflecting the critical importance of a humanitarian/development/peace nexus approach in Libya, lessons learned demonstrate that: (a) upstream work is essential to strengthening the resilience and shock-resistance of national systems, including advocacy for child-friendly budgets; (b) increasing the scale of emergency preparedness and humanitarian response, in partnership with local actors, continues to be a critical priority; (c) strengthening equity-focused basic service delivery, both upstream and downstream (including evidence-based, risk-informed programming) is essential for preventing and responding to emerging needs, with a particular focus on increasing accountability to affected population; and (d) UNICEF’s full presence in Libya (as of mid-2018) has improved the quality of programming and monitoring. 

The Country Programme 2019–2020 will finally provide UNICEF with a comprehensive roadmap for the coming two years. Significant shifts in programming include: (a) a focus on system- strengthening and multi-sectoral service delivery to support the humanitarian-development-peace nexus; (b) programme delivery through modelling/piloting for scale-up, supported by evidence-generation; (c) expansion into new programme areas, namely social policy and child survival and development; and (d) a strategic focus on pertinent cross-cutting themes – children on the move, gender, youth and adolescents and emergency preparedness and response.

Protection challenges for some Libyans – particularly irregular foreign nationals in the country –are of grave concern, primarily driven by exposure, vulnerability and the inability to cope with conflict and violence, human rights violations and abuses, contamination from explosive hazards in urban centres, breakdown of rule of law and major impediments to accessing critical services. In 2018 UNICEF began programming to address the needs of children on the move in urban settings, and has undertaken emergency response in detention centres, while maintaining and clearly articulating its opposition to the detention of children and advocating for alternatives. UNICEF has built on memoranda of understanding signed with the UNHCR and IOM to ensure coordinated response and advocacy.

"
MENAR,Morocco,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
National reform process
The 2011 Constitution laid the foundation for a more open, democratic and modern society and continues to represent an unprecedented opportunity for the realization of child rights in Morocco. The Constitution recognizes the supremacy of international conventions such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child over national laws, sets up independent monitoring bodies, and confirms that the State must provide equal protection and equal social and moral consideration to all children, irrespective of their family situation. Within this framework, the Government launched justice, education, decentralization and social protection reforms in 2014-2015 that have been providing the space for renewed engagement with UNICEF to enhance investment in child well-being.

While the national reform process (particularly in the field of education, social protection and child rights monitoring) has generally provided for opportunities to advance child rights and position UNICEF strongly as the guardian of Convention on the Rights of the Child, its slow pace has affected the achievement of some of the targets set for the year. That has also brought to the surface the need for more strategic investment in national and local capacity building to address broader governance challenges. 

In particular, the regionalization (decentralization) process, which has not advanced at the planned pace, has influenced slow progress on planned results for UNICEF. Experiences in 2018 showed that where UNICEF worked directly with regions, such as in the education sector, it greatly facilitated results. The challenge is how to replicate this model in sectors where the institutional decentralization process is not as advanced. Via the midterm review planned for 2019, UNICEF will reflect on how to better address this issue and explore partnerships with local entities such as regional councils. 

In the justice sector, the process to ensure independence of the judiciary power from the executive has required more investment from UNICEF Morocco to match the new roles and responsibilities of stakeholders with the interventions of the programme and expected results for children. UNICEF engaged several stretch assignments and obtained a time-extension for the funding to address this issue. 

Other constraints related to sensitive issues such as social norms related to violence against children and de-institutionalization. Progress was slow in those areas, with activities waiting for validation by institutional partners. Experience in 2018 showed that diversification of partnerships will be needed to advance work in such areas. 

The role that UNICEF played in the social protection reform process in 2018 merits special attention. UNICEF supported the Ministry of General Affairs and Governance to lead the reform process and provided technical assistance, with financial support from the European Union. UNICEF is at the very heart of this reform process, with an influential role, and excellent visibility. The King’s throne speech in July directly referred to the findings and recommendations put forward in UNICEF’s work. As advised by UNICEF Regional Office and Headquarters colleagues, UNICEF Morocco needs to strike a balance between a convening and an influencing role, and it is not always easy to reconcile the two. Going forward, UNICEF Morocco will need to prioritise which aspects of the reform agenda it will focus on in greater detail, and which elements it will leverage others (such as the International Labour Organization or the World Bank) to take the lead on. It makes sense for UNICEF to focus particularly on the aspects of the reform agenda that deal with children and with vulnerable population categories, including children on the move.

Partnerships 
The Moroccan context, which includes the Government, civil society and  constitutional entities reporting directly to the Palace, and an increased focus on decentralization, requires continuous investment in a high number of strategic partnerships. UNICEF is well positioned in that regard and has been able to build good relations with both the Government and the royal circle (advisors, foundations and non-governmental organizations chaired by members of the royal family). This supported the achievement of both direct and leveraged results for children in 2018. The management of those relationships and partnerships needs constant attention, as power mapping in the country is dynamic and must be closely followed if UNICEF is to continue to maintain its influence. The high number of partnerships (there were 19 active workplans in 2018), while necessary, also carries risks related to UNICEF’s ability to maintain high quality collaboration and keep transaction and time costs at reasonable levels.

Results were constrained in areas where partnerships need to be strengthened and/or diversified. Especially for child protection system strengthening, UNICEF will need to diversify its partnerships to accelerate results. The Country Programme with the national government concentrates on improving national systems for providing services. Parallel interventions with respect to knowledge, attitudes and practices and levels of empowerment, as well as action at the local level or specific actions for disadvantaged groups, also act as vehicles of change. To deliver results in those areas, partnerships with subnational actors, civil society and academia need to be further strengthened. There have been significant delays in workplan signatures for  the work on public finance for children and decentralization. UNICEF may not yet be seen as a partner of choice for those areas, but perhaps can have an important role to play in leveraging resources for children.

Resource mobilization
UNICEF Morocco successfully mobilized resources, with more than 70 per cent of the Other Resources ceiling on hand at the end of the second year of the 5-year programme cycle. The ability to convey to potential financial partners how the fulfilment of child rights contributes to dividends such as stability, reduction in population movements/migration, preventing/combating violent extremism has been key to that success. UNICEF will need to continue to strengthen this argument and encourage funding that aims to strengthen systems for all vulnerable children, while taking into account the populations in particular need. While the funding pipeline is strong overall, in 2019 special attention will need to be paid to under-resourced programme areas and those for which multi-year funding will come to an end.  

Private sector fundraising is a promising trend, but there has been no formal exploration of  untapped opportunities. UNICEF Morocco has had only a few experiences with private sector donors to date, but they have been positive. The potential for private sector fundraising and corporate social responsibility in support of programme interventions needs to be explored with the support of PFP.

Office growth and operations
In 2018, UNICEF Morocco transitioned from a small- to a medium-sized office, with throughput doubling as compared to 2017, to approximately US$10 million in utilization and staff size growing to 39. This growth presented several challenges that will need continued attention going forward. These include the fact that there is an increased accountability to donors as non-core budget has grown and a need to show tangible results in a traditionally upstream context. The growth also resulted in a need for effective technical onboarding of new staff and for staff heading growing sections to shift roles from specialists to managers. UNICEF also needs to ensure that growth is aligned between programme and operations. 

Transfers to counterparts make up the largest portion of expenditures (approximately 50 per cent in 2018), followed by staff costs (25 per cent), contractual service (10 per cent), general operations (8 per cent), supplies (3 per cent), and travel (3 per cent). The vast majority of transfers to counterparts were via direct cash transfers (92 per cent), followed by direct payment (6 per cent) and reimbursement (2 per cent). UNICEF Morocco made considerable progress in the timely liquidation of direct cash transfers, meeting organizational benchmarks for most of 2018, despite significant increase in throughput. Long-standing liquidation bottlenecks with UNICEF Morocco’s  were resolved thanks to dedicated capacity building of partners and close monitoring. However, some issues remained and will require continued focus, especially with new partners.

These lessons learned and constraints will feed into UNICEF Morocco’s midterm review process, planned for 2019.

"
MENAR,Oman,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Lessons learned 

Operating in a high-income country such as Oman, which still benefits from programme support from UNICEF on a wide range of matters, requires modifications from the programming usually designed for low and middle-income countries.  Following a review of the UNICEF Oman Country Programme implementation during the first half of the programme cycle 2017 – 2020, some key lessons were identified:

One, the need for a broad programme structure to accommodate emerging government needs  
The three programme outcomes - integrated early childhood development; the protection of children from violence; and the inclusion of children with disabilities - while relevant, limited UNICEF Oman support to early childhood and children in need of special protection. The country’s emerging priorities and the Government’s requests did not always fit within this structure. For example, focusing on integrated early childhood development and inclusive education did not contribute to mainstream education. Yet, government requests were clear that such support was needed in a few strategic and catalytic areas to improve learning outcomes and employability, given the importance of Omanisation and Tanfeedh (an initiative to diversify national income resources). 

Two, the need to refocus activities  
Overall, the work of the programme management group, proposed by UNICEF Oman and established by ministerial decree, was instrumental in resolving obstacles in programme implementation. Formed of representatives from the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Social Development, and the National Centre for Statistics and Information, the programme management group takes a holistic approach to the country programme, promoting cross-sectoral linkages and facilitating the endorsement of progressive interventions. Nonetheless, more progress could have been realized if a more focused and strategic selection of activities was endorsed, building on UNICEF’s added value in high-income countries. Selected activities would need to have the potential for maximum impact, synergy, scalability and sustainability.

Three, cross-cutting challenges  
It was recognized that in many areas, appropriate policies and laws were largely in place and that access was not a problem for mainstream services. Rather, bottlenecks were related to: 1) weak implementation of existing policies and programmes; 2) specific gaps in laws, policies and regulatory frameworks affecting children; 3) inadequate quality of services – especially at sub-national levels; 4) sub-optimal planning and data systems, and therefore, a lack of effective planning, targeting and robust disaggregated data; and 5) behaviour and practices that are not conducive to the realisation of child rights.

Four, the added value of UNICEF Oman in a high-income country lies in innovative approaches and ideas, which the Government could then take to scale 
As such, UNICEF Oman must use some independent “seed” funding for introducing interventions and providing Government with relevant evidence. In this regard, allocating some of the Global Thematic Funds in Education to UNICEF Oman was highly appropriate and effective. Other sectors will need such allocations as well. 

The need to strengthen national capacities is considerable and should not be underestimated (regardless of Oman’s high-income country status). As most UNICEF Oman interventions involve innovative approaches, there is a need for appropriate technical assistance in operating or scaling up initiatives. UNICEF Oman will continue providing support to capacity building in these new areas. In addition, to ensure sustainability of capacity building initiatives, it is essential that they became institutional in universities and ministry’s training institutes. 

Taking into consideration lessons learned, it was decided to broaden the scope of the country programme in 2019, also focusing on a number of well-defined and strategically-selected areas that synergize with government-funded interventions, with the aim to be more upstream. UNICEF Oman’s added value thus lies in its global experience and convening ability to identify and call upon the required technical expertise and knowledge as necessary and in the highest quality possible.  

Accordingly programme strategies were consolidated from six to four:

1. Social behavioural-change communication: The Government and private sector partners should be supported in the social behavioural-change communication strategy to address issues linked to demand, knowledge and behaviour, such as inappropriate young child feeding, unhygienic practices by care givers, violence against children and boys dropping out of school. Social behavioural-change communication should engage communities and the public at all levels, and through a variety of channels, including television and inter-personal channels. Extensive use of the internet and mobile technologies offer new opportunities.

2. Institutional strengthening: Special support should be provided to enhance the effectiveness, efficiency and timely impact of institutional performance. There is a need to encourage: a) joint initiatives on children's issues by sectoral ministries, to move away from verticality, to achieve synergy and ensure an integrated multi-sectoral response to key child concerns, and b) sustainability of robust, in-depth building and upgrading of professional capacities in domains closely related to children’s welfare. 

3. Evidence-based policy analysis and advocacy: Advocacy needs a strategic plan in support of the country programme goals and targets, but with its own goals and milestones for influencing policy development and resource allocation. Strategically-prepared study tours for decision-makers can influence programmes and policy in Oman. South-South and triangular cooperation should be promoted, with care given in selecting countries, taking into account the numerous achievements of the Sultanate. In 2018, two successful study tours were organized to New York City and Jordan. 

4. Strategic partnerships for children to elevate children’s issues to a higher level: Prior to 2018, UNICEF Oman had limited experience with partnerships beyond the three-line ministries of Social Development, Health and Education and the National Centre for Statistics and Information. As outlined above, UNICEF started new partnerships with the State Council, the Ministry of Higher Education, and academic and research institutions. Partnerships with the private sector and non-government organizations were also established.

MENAR,"Palestine, State of",Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
UNICEF delivered results for children and women in 2018 through joint and integrated programming; innovation; partnerships and campaigns; policy and evidence generation; and capacity-building. Solid plans are in place to deliver Area Programme Document 2018-2022 and the Humanitarian Response Plan (2018-2020) results, but the programming environment poses challenges to the UNICEF State of Palestine programme theory of change.

UNICEF State of Palestine engaged in joint and integrated programming in 2018, especially the early childhood development programme and the East Jerusalem and United Nations joint justice Sawasiya II programme. Based on evidence generated on children with disabilities in Palestine, UNICEF prioritized developmental delays and disabilities under the early childhood development programme. UNICEF worked with the Ministries of Health, Education and Social Development based on a Europe and Central Asia regional office model, in partnership with a non-government organization from Bosnia and Herzegovina. UNICEF piloted early detection of children with disabilities and developmental delays in 62 locations across Gaza and the West Bank; the child-development assessment instruments were adapted to Palestine. A brief video on the early childhood development programme was produced.  

A lesson learned through early childhood development implementation was that a paradigm shift is required concerning service providers’ areas of work and the type of services that communities expect to receive in health facilities. UNICEF has planned an evaluation of the early childhood development model in 2019 to generate lessons for scale-up.  

UNICEF support on policy for people with disability included the revision of the disability law with Ministry of Social Development, and the drafting of the state party report on the Convention on the Rights of People Living with Disability. There is room for coordination of programming for people with disabilities in Palestine; recommendations from the committee will provide the basis for solid policy dialogue. 

UNICEF, United Nations Relief and Works Agency and local partners implemented Keeping Kids Cool, a project to engage children in sports and recreational activities and to respond to the mental health challenges faced by children in Gaza. In total 19,980 children (10,151 girls and 9,829) were reached and an additional 36,000 will benefit by February 2019 from recreational and psychosocial activities across 88 locations of the Gaza Strip (47 Relief and Works Agency, 30 government schools, seven community-based rehabilitation centres and one Relief and Works Agency rehabilitation centre for the visually impaired). Project staff members from the institutions were trained on child safety, child rights and protection issues.

Palestinian children living in East Jerusalem are growing-up under extremely difficult circumstances. Compared to Israeli children, Palestinians are more likely to live in poor households, have poor educational attainment and live in homes under threat of demolition. Palestinian children in East Jerusalem have frequent, and often violent, encounters with Israeli forces at checkpoints, during raids and arrests at homes, schools and public spaces. Given these challenges, and with the Palestinian Authority limited access to deliver services, UNICEF supports coordination and cooperation between the United Nations country team and Palestinian civil society organizations to improve interventions and donors’ return on investments supporting Palestinians in East Jerusalem. UNICEF is an active member of the core group of United Nations agencies and civil society in developing a practical approach to address the priorities in 2019-2020. The group developed an East Jerusalem action plan, with UNICEF actions including child protection, WASH, health and education. UNICEF with United Nations Development Programme and United Nations Women delivers a joint rule of law, gender, justice and human rights programme, Sawasiya II (2018 to 2023) that targets bottlenecks in justice and security services and supports institutions to provide legal aid. In 2018, UNICEF developed a legal standards manual for the defence of children arrested and detained by Israeli forces, for better legal representation. 

UNICEF State of Palestine embraces innovation to overcome barriers in programming in a challenging socio-political context. UNICEF works with partners, including ministries, civil society and partners in the global south, to develop and bring innovations to scale. UNICEF is working with the Ministry of Education and Higher Education and a national university to pilot a new pedagogical tool called ‘learning objects’ that promotes children’s active engagement in classrooms by engaging with objects in their everyday lives. In the pilot schools, the programme has had success. UNICEF is working with the university to transfer the methodology to Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia.  

The Gaza water crisis posed an acute challenge with innovative approaches required. UNICEF supports the largest water desalination plant in Gaza, providing water to 75,000 people. With the plant’s capacity limited by electricity shortages, UNICEF supported the construction of the largest solar field in Gaza. The second and third phases of the plant will soon bring the plant’s capacity up to provision of sufficient water for 250,000 people.  

UNICEF also supported a photovoltaic-powered electrodialysis reversal brackish water desalination plant installed in Gaza, with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The environmental sustainability analysis of this plant shows that it requires only around 60 per cent of the energy typically required for conventional reverse osmosis desalination systems. The plant is a scalable innovative solution for water-energy scarce contexts, such as the Gaza Strip. To quantify the environmental impact of this, the carbon footprint for existing large-scale systems were compared with the new plant system, and the carbon footprint for UNICEF/MIT’s plant was two to eight times lower than the large-scale plants in Gaza. 

Stakeholder engagement was critical for programme ownership and to achieve goals. The partnerships that UNICEF built around the launch of the violence against children and the Generation Unlimited campaigns in 2018 were essential for programme outcomes. The Generation Unlimited campaign was designed with the Government, private sector and civil society as a cross-sector platform to promote innovative solutions to adolescent problems, focusing on creating opportunities for young people. Generation Unlimited aims to meet the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal on ensuring all young people aged 10-24 are engaged in learning, training or employment. Entrepreneurship programmes supported adolescents to play a more active role in their communities with initiatives enabling them to research issues in their communities and develop social enterprises.  

Generation Unlimited overlaps with violence against children priorities, and UNICEF prioritized protecting adolescents from violence in their communities through initiatives including: educational evenings for parents; training early childhood development supervisors on positive-discipline; adolescent-led awareness campaigns on violence; youth civic participation and providing adolescents with skills to address violence in their communities through drama, debates and social media. However, there remain ingrained attitudes toward to violence in society, and violence reduction will remain a long-term programme priority.

Policy development and evidence generation were essential to the country programme. In 2018, UNICEF State of Palestine supported the Ministry of Social Development to draft and submit the first report on the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, with an advanced draft of the report on the Convention on the Rights of People with Disability under development. The Convention on the Rights of the Child report is planned for Committee discussion in January 2020, with the recommendations expected to feed into policy dialogue.  

UNICEF State of Palestine is committed to securing the rights of children and women through data gathered from evaluations and research. The scope of UNICEF evidence generation activities is driven by the complexity of issues in Palestine with humanitarian and development programmes, and high levels of internal and external scrutiny on programme effectiveness and efficiency. In 2018, UNICEF-commissioned studies included: a rapid assessment of vulnerabilities, resilience, coping mechanisms, and service delivery gaps in Hebron Governorate; a study on out-of-school children; a knowledge, attitudes and practices survey on social cohesion; a barrier analysis for infant and young child feeding; and a baseline knowledge, attitude and practice study on early childhood development. 

UNICEF completed three evaluations in 2018 on family centres in Gaza; post-natal home visits; and the Al Fakhoura programme, ‘investing in education and building resilience in Gaza’. The findings are being used to inform programme design. For example, the terms of reference for the child protection community committees were reviewed to embed community support and ownership and prioritization of the family centres as a social service in the communities. Another programme improvement from the family centre evaluation was the development of standard operating procedures for gender-based violence in child protection programming in Gaza.

UNICEF invested in capacity building and system strengthening for government ministries and partners to ensure programme sustainability and quality programme delivery. To strengthen social work capacity, a university curriculum review continued with the Ministry of Social Development and a national university, in cooperation with an Australian university. The cooperation used child protection materials to further design high diploma curriculums on child protection. Another national university received joint support from UNICEF and the World Bank to revise the early childhood development training curriculum to include modules on child development behavioural scale and guides to development the individual family plan of service and interventions. UNICEF with World Bank support provided training to 15 university professors from faculties including health, education and social science. 

UNICEF worked with partners to support the Ministry of Social Development social protection and case management reform process. In the current system, social workers conduct proxy means testing of beneficiaries alongside their work to support most vulnerable families. The Ministry of Social Development plans reforms that will shift social workers’ time to support the most vulnerable and the most complicated cases. UNICEF provided the ministry with materials to develop the information management platform, with plans to build an integrated national social registry. UNICEF built the capacity of the ministry monitoring and evaluation system to better use existing databases across different departments in the ministry. Support for this reform process will continue in partnership with the European Union and the World Bank.

Training was provided to all partners in UNICEF-led humanitarian clusters on the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse and helped leadin establishing and co-chairing a task force on the issue for the United Nations country team and humanitarian country team.

UNICEF and the Ministry of Health were engaged in discussions on strengthening the capacity of supply chain personnel, supporting the multi-year vaccine forecasting and developing a consultant terms of reference scheduled for 2019. However, the new requirement by the Israeli authorities changed planning parameters. As a result, vaccine planning for 2019 and beyond will require clarification of the rules and legislation to continue without interruption.

In 2018, the UNICEF State of Palestine office underwent both an external and internal audit of a donor funded WASH project in Gaza. The audit recommendations will be utilized to strengthen programmes and operations. Audit recommendations included the need to strengthen partnership management. In response, UNICEF established a process for reinforced due diligence.  

UNICEF trained staff and partners on the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse, and on financial and programmatic assurance. UNICEF co-chairs the humanitarian country team and United Nations country team’s prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse task force established in 2018. UNICEF will review processes for the escalation of identified risks with UNICEF headquarters and inter-agency partners. Also, in 2018 the UNICEF has reinforced processes for in-country escalation of any issues arising with the Israeli authorities. UNICEF will strengthen fraud-mitigation procedures in2019, in line with the global anti-fraud policy issued in 2018, trainingstaff and partners.

The first year of the five-year programme cycle for the Area Programme Document, there were considerable changes to the programming environment in 2018, including the Great March of Return and an increase in poverty in Gaza; the United States’ recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel; and the US funding cuts to Palestine and particularly to United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine. Other challenges that intensified in 2018 included the intra-Palestinian divide and the shrinking operational space faced by humanitarian and development actors.  

Finally, operating risks are increasing. UNICEF State of Palestine will observe risk going forward, including the shrinking space for the United Nations and non-government organizations, both financially and programmatically, which hinders service delivery to children and families. The political landscape continues to evolve, such as the dissolution of the Palestinian Legislative Council in December 2018, pointing to a further division between the political leadership in the West Bank and Gaza. The first state party report to the Convention on the Rights of the Child confirmed the analysis of challenges facing children in the State of Palestine.

The above-mentioned factors are not sufficient to undermine the theory of change for the Area Programme Document, but do pose serious challenges to some of the planning context. The theory of change and results logic remain largely relevant for the country programme; risks will continue to be monitored with appropriate mitigating measures.

In 2019 and beyond, UNICEF State of Palestine will continue to focus on priorities captured in the Area Programme Document (2018-2022) and the Humanitarian Response Plan (2018-2020). Programmes have more impact when delivered in a comprehensive package of interventions to people in needand a range of delivery options can be adopted, including geographic or thematic convergence.  

UNICEF State of Palestine will continue to position itself as a knowledge-broker for children. The 2019 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey with the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics will be central in 2019, building into the Sustainable Development Goals for Palestinian children. UNICEF must expand its partnerships in 2019, and a framework is in place to do so with three core themes of the Area Programme Document: adolescence, through the Generation Unlimited; disability, by making the disability law operational; and violence reduction, through the violence against children campaign.

Child rights are central to the UNICEF State of Palestine programme. UNICEF will leverage the state party presentation on the Convention of the Rights of the Child report, to put child rights at the core of discussion with the Government of the State of Palestine. This will be especially meaningful marking the 30th anniversary of the Convention of the Rights in 2019.

"
MENAR,Saudi Arabia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
UNICEF Gulf Area Office found the process for developing the new sub-regional programme to be a valuable opportunity to assess lessons learned that could guide its future practice.

The countries in this sub-region are highly developed. Therefore, UNICEF’s primary challenge was to determine result areas that would have an impact on the lives of children in the Gulf by clarifying UNICEF’s comparative advantage and determining strategic priorities responsive to the context. Despite limitations in its current staffing and resources, UNICEF was able to meet this challenge by: using national development plans as a key reference, exchanging ideas with sister UN agencies about their programming experiences in high-income countries, relying on technical expertise from UNICEF’s Regional Office and Headquarters and by proposing innovative models for UNICEF’s presence in the Gulf. 

In the previous programme cycle, UNICEF GAO maintained dual, though largely distinct functions: engaging in resource mobilization with Gulf-based actors on behalf of the organization globally, and pursuing programmes for children in the Gulf. The success and limitations of this hybrid of global and sub-regional roles was also reviewed through staff consultations at all levels of the organization – headquarters, regional office, and UNICEF Gulf Area Office. Collectively this reflection concluded that for UNICEF to be relevant in the context of a changing landscape in the Gulf, it would need to be more engaged in all five countries and have a more integrated approach to all its functions (programmes, partnerships and advocacy) to coherently engage with public and private partners. UNICEF anticipates that this approach  will be more impactful in advancing the rights of children in the Gulf, in the region and around the world. 

Lessons learned 

Programming in the Gulf 
UNICEF’s Gulf Area Office supports programmes in the Gulf and has a presence in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which is completely reliant on funding from host countries. UNICEF has adjusted this scenario in its upcoming programme cycle in significant ways. Firstly, it has sharpened its programmatic focus to align more clearly with the national priorities of the region. By reviewing the situation of children in each country and engaging in country-level dialogue, even where UNICEF was not present, a more robust set of programme priorities have been identified and endorsed: to support early childhood programmes, especially for the first two years of life, to improve the data landscape for children such that relevant and quality data on children is gathered and utilized effectively and child protection systems are strengthened. 

Second, the multi-sector and integrated nature of the programme priorities, which require engagement with multiple line ministries for each result area, leverages UNICEF’s comparative advantage as a knowledge leader on children across sectors. The ability to tap into technical expertise across thematic domains and across the organization should position UNICEF to partner more substantively in providing timely and quality support to countries. For example, in the Emirates this approach, leveraging UNICEF’s experience across the organization to become a “first point of call” on issues facing children, has been used successfully. UNICEF anticipates that the diverse consultations undertaken for developing the programme, strengthened by high-level advocacy across the organization, should yield greater commitment by all countries to the results that have been jointly agreed upon. The signing of a basic cooperation agreement for UNICEF to operate in Qatar is an expression of this strengthened partnership. UNICEF also concluded that its presence in Saudi Arabia and the Emirates has fostered strong partnerships with its lead partners, which facilitated linkages with a broader range of line ministries. These expanded networks will be critical for realizing the multi-sector priorities of the next cycle, such as early childhood development programmes. UNICEF expects that presence in Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar will also enable greater progress in achieving results for children. 

UNICEF’s Gulf Area Office has also come to better understand the types of technical support requested by Gulf countries, which has implications for incoming staff. The countries of the Gulf are well-positioned to seek assistance from many of the most reputable and recognized institutions around the world. However, they look to UNICEF – and the UN-at-large -- to offer guidance on best practices and share programming standards and norms. In developing the sub-regional programme, UNICEF was successful in showcasing UNICEF’s potential in each country context. However, to meet expectations and fulfil this role across the programmatic result areas, UNICEF is working on a recruitment plan that will identify senior staff able to partner effectively with leadership in each country context, with skills to identify and build technical networks that can be called upon to support sector-wide approaches. Given that UNICEF’s presence will not be sizeable, staff will also need to be conversant in child rights, using strategic programming opportunities to fulfil UNICEF’s normative mandate, raise awareness about child rights and strengthen the focus on gender equality. Finally, the growing number of agencies working to expand their presence and portfolio in the Gulf will need to be fully engaged in country-level processes responding to the UN reform agenda, including in countries where UN strategic partnership frameworks are being implemented. Strengthened collaboration with UN sister agencies presents an important platform for providing coordinated support for implementation of the SDGs for all children.

Public and private partnerships 
The approach to partnerships, with a view to leveraging commitments for children, will be informed by recent experience, including:

• Integrated approaches to programming and partnerships: UNICEF Gulf Area Office recognizes that more robust programmes within the Gulf have the potential to tangibly show how the realization of children’s rights can be advanced, which can assist in advocacy in support of children globally. In addition, partnerships with the public and private sectors present key opportunities to address the life-cycle of a child from birth through young adulthood. While early childhood programmes will focus on improving children’s quality of life during the first years, other partnerships (such as Generation Unlimited) offer a means to build on early investments in children through partnerships with the private sector that sustain those early gains through adolescence and beyond by ensuring that young people possess the skills they need to participate in the rapidly changing environments of the Gulf.

• Paradigm shift - viewing donors as partners: UNICEF also invested more substantially in engaging with government partners as more than donors. This shift has involved working strategically with partners to respond to their needs for technical assistance and information-gathering, and their ambition to engage in leadership roles within the region or globally. This approach is presenting new channels for promoting children’s rights.

• Context-appropriate engagement: UNICEF also recognized that face-to-face interaction and dialogue is of paramount importance in the Gulf. Therefore, ongoing support from UNICEF leadership, at all levels, has given greater impetus to recent priorities – whether working to establish UNICEF presence in new countries or signing key agreements – and provided much- needed funding during crises. 

• Promoting a shift to flexible funding. Funds received to date from Gulf partners have been predominantly for emergencies. While this was due to escalating crises, particularly in MENA, the UNICEF Gulf Area Office needs to continue advocacy with partners to consider funding “forgotten” crises and/or more development and resilience-oriented programming. 

• Increasing UNICEF’s visibility and advocacy. Considerable efforts were undertaken in 2018 to engage with corporate entities. From an advocacy standpoint, this was successful; key events and influencers reached far more individuals with UNICEF’s brand, messaging and programming priorities around the world. Translating this increased visibility into major new funding remains a challenge, which may be mitigated through sustained communication and discussion with partners.

Country operations 
Development of the area programme management plan (APMP) that accompanies the sub-regional programme, defining key result areas and the resources and processes (funding, staffing, and governance mechanisms) required to achieve them, provided the entire office with an opportunity to reflect upon lessons learned in country operations. 

A series of consultations with UNICEF Oman facilitated by the UNICEF MENA Regional Office (MENARO) highlighted opportunities to share resources – particularly around human resources, finance and administrative functions. In reviewing the volume and complexity of transitions performed at both locations, a recommendation was made to create a joint operational hub to support these roles. The increased capacity afforded by the hub will also assist with the establishment and scale-up of operations in three new country locations.

The innovative approaches called for in the new sub-regional programme – including an increased focus on integrated functions across programme and partnership roles, the need for high-level advocacy and engagement with partners in each country and for talented staff able to lead programme operations –demands a strong recruitment plan in coming months, with the support of MENARO’s human resources team. UNICEF will use lessons learned in operating in multiple locations to orient incoming staff. Finally, the operations team will prioritize findings from staff consultations in recent months, including supporting a culture of effective communication across units to maintain shared understanding on programme implementation and to support the re-tooling or re-profiling of existing staff to fulfil new roles, as appropriate.

"
MENAR,Sudan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
In a protracted humanitarian context with the onset of additional economic, social and climate-related emergencies, UNICEF Sudan took concrete steps to mitigate and overcome programme challenges and advance the humanitarian, development and peace nexus (HDPN) in 2018. While emergency incidents required immediate response with service delivery to meet the urgent needs of affected populations, UNICEF Sudan strengthened its efforts on resilience- building at all levels to mitigate risks in a preventive and sustainable manner. 

UNICEF demonstrated its comparative advantage for influencing upstream engagement by providing technical expertise and convening a wide range of partners across all states in a series of consultations leading to successful ownership and high-level commitment to the SDG agenda at sub-national and national levels, and to the development of SDG 6 plans and budgets for all 18 states in Sudan. 

Despite these positive results, UNICEF Sudan faced a number of challenges in programme implementation. The economic crisis adversely impacted UNICEF Sudan’s programme delivery. Fuel shortages and an increase in overall operational costs caused delays in procurement and service delivery. The weakening currency caused significant delays in procurement in local markets, as imported materials became scarce, affecting emergency supplies and construction materials. Rapid inflation raised the cost of spare parts, such as for water facilities and public health centres, requiring significant budgetary adjustments to programmes. Negotiations with suppliers took longer than usual, since they were reluctant to commit to specific rates due to unpredictability, resulting in implementation delays and posing difficulties for communities and government partners to meet financial requirements for constructing and maintaining facilities. 

UNICEF Sudan, particularly its field offices, coped with the lack of fuel and currency through advocacy with government counterparts. The needs of UNICEF’s partners were outlined to state line ministries so that they were prioritized within state allocations and measures could be taken to reduce shortage complications. For example, in Nyala and Demazine, field offices took direct action to urge the state governor, which resulted in making the required supply of fuel and cash available for lifesaving interventions through associated state government ministries. The Kadugli field office reported similar outcomes through advocacy with various government institutions. Unfortunately, this prioritization did not extend to non-government implementing partners, which continued to face challenges that required alternative solutions, such as: sector-level coordination to implement joint field missions, utilizing solar power systems rather than fuel to run water supply systems, using checks as an alternative to cash payments and activating previously negotiated supply agreements with other UN agencies to tap into parallel supplies. 

The continued rise in inflation also caused challenges to UNICEF staff retention, particularly among field monitors in field offices who were contracted as UN Volunteers. The real value of incentives decreased, resulting in high staff turnover– especially during the local harvest season – leading to significantly higher operational costs and weakened implementation. Staff resignations were exacerbated by lengthy recruitment times, the loss of project knowledge and substantial gaps in monitoring activities. As a mitigation measure, UNICEF Sudan agreed with the UNV Office to augment lists of potential future hires by recommending more than one person to ensure fall-back candidates should the first recommended decline or a staff member resign. The existing talent pool was also used to speed up the recruitment process. 

In addition to inflation and lack of supplies, the restructuring of government ministries and reorganization of intrastate boundaries created uncertainty, with implications for programme implementation. Ministerial decision-making required for programme implementation had a gap in officially appointed nodal ministry. Concerns arose that combining localities could raise tensions as previously separated tribal structures were adjusted to new compositions, often by downsizing. The new government structure will become more visible as official decisions are made by state governments during the course of 2019. UNICEF Sudan has been mitigating risks by using previously established working relationships with specific line ministries, at both the organizational and personal levels, during structural transitions to monitor the situation and strengthen the pre-positioning of life-saving supplies.

Fifty-nine per cent of UNICEF Sudan’s ‘other resources’ allotment was emergency funding (US$ 58 million) in 2018, and 41 per cent was for development funding (US$40 million), at a time when the office was trying to move to longer-term policy development work. Of the emergency funding, a significant part came with strict conditionality and some US$9 million provided less than six months’ for implementation, posing additional constraints on quality implementation, especially as partners concurrently struggled with lack of cash and inflation. A new trend over 2017 and 2018 were so called “nexus projects” – funding from donors (e.g. EU, Germany, the Netherlands) shifting from one year to multi-year initiatives and clearly directed at  activities related to the humanitarian-development-peace nexus (HDPN) with a strong focus on resilience and durable, sustainable solutions. Such initiatives have been discussed for Eastern Sudan, West Kordofan and North Darfur as examples. These funding streams were often linked to migration or refugees.

UNICEF Sudan applied C4D, including community engagement, widely as a key strategy in all programmes. This lead to an understanding that a comprehensive, integrated C4D strategy is instrumental to ensuring a holistic, life-cycle approach to programming. Thus UNICEF began developing a multi-year, integrated C4D strategy to be rolled out during the rest of the country programme cycle. 

Lack of up-to-date data posed a serious challenge to programming, and monitoring systems in different sectors are not always adequate, accurate or accessible, particularly for child protection. Hence the baseline for the majority of indicators was the MICS 2014, and measuring progress since that time is not possible, as no population-based survey has taken place in the interim. UNICEF did complete data collection for S3M, which will provide a robust set of new data encompassing most sectors in 2019.

The main lesson learned in Sudan during 2018 was that the international community has embraced the humanitarian-development peace nexus (HDPN) approach, and agreed to adopt it as the default approach from now on as an international community. Within UNICEF, HDPN coordination was explored and discussed specifically for the education, nutrition and WASH sectors, including with NGO partners from each sector. As an overall outcome and lesson from 2018: HDPN coordination for education seems to be feasible; nutrition will be more complex, but feasible, in 2019; and for WASH the main lesson is that the overall HDPN coordination requires rapprochement among partners working on water with those working on sanitation and hygiene.

"
MENAR,Syria,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
UNICEF Syria learned several lessons during 2018, mainly on: the humanitarian/development continuum nexus, innovation, community engagement, preparedness of the emergency response and programme evaluation. 

Some of these lessons were learned due to challenges faced by the organization in Syria, such as: restricted access to some areas of the country, limited operational capacities and additional bureaucratic layers required by local NGOs that had been UNICEF implementing partners and earmarked funding (both geographically and thematically), which did not provide the office with the necessary flexibility to immediately shift resources in response to continuously emerging new crises. Other key challenges faced in 2018 included politicization of the funding stream; large-scale destruction of basic services, infrastructure and human capital; widespread poverty (a majority of the population is living below the poverty line); deepened fractures in the social fabric; internal complexity, due to the presence of non-state actors and foreign forces in the country; and lack of clarity on the institutional framework, especially regarding the future of the United Nations strategic framework with the Government of Syria, which was delayed. 

An important lesson learned in 2018 was that a properly designed short-term response provides a natural entry point for more long-term, resilience-focused interventions (establishing a continuum/nexus between humanitarian and development interventions). Within this context, UNICEF Syria considered two interconnected elements to be more strategic in intent and operational efficiency.  

First, given the presence of 5.3 million children in need of immediate humanitarian aid in the country, it is important that the delivery of supplies be accompanied by the strengthening of local capacities in all areas. This was the case in key areas of intervention, such as health (through strengthening immunization capacity), child protection (through psychosocial support and mine-risk education) and education (through self-learning). Second, eight years of conflict have had a devastating impact on Syria’s economy and social fabric; the conflict eroded several decades’ worth of human development achievements and led to the reversal of all key child well-being indicators. The country experienced the degradation of public services at an unprecedented rate and scale – both in terms of infrastructure destruction and, more importantly, erosion of the social fabric. Within this complex backdrop, UNICEF Syria supported programmatic interventions that contributed to restoring services and their functionality, while also aiming to reassemble the social fabric. The programme had a two-pronged approach: to immediately address war’s repercussions on various sectors and halting the continued deterioration of systems by developing qualitative strategies for government services. This approach is more efficient in the long run than rebuilding systems from the ground up after they have totally collapsed.

UNICEF Syria engaged in a series of innovative initiatives in 2018, especially for young people, such as the ‘raise your voice – Syria’, an initiative framed as a competition between young people (aged 14–24) interested in publishing stories, blogs, photos and videos. This competition was the first of its kind in Syria, and was hosted in the cities of Tartous, Al-Hasakeh and Quamishli, to promote a culture of blogging in the community, improve young people’s blogging skills and encourage them to express themselves. This also enhanced their digital participation on UNICEF’s Voice of Youth (VoY) Arabic platform and other similar platforms. Over 300 young people (60 per cent females) applied from the governorates of Damascus, Rural Damascus, Homs, Hama, Tartous, Lattakia, Al-Hasakeh and Deir-ez-Zor. From these, 112 were short-listed to participate in a five-day challenge event from 25–30 July 2018. All participants were trained on blogging, writing and presentation skills and at the end of the five days three were declared winners. About 100 blogs were written by young participants during this competition, nine of which were published on UNICEF’s global VoY platform to date, although more are planned to be published in upcoming months. In addition, three young bloggers from Tartous took the lead on promoting the initiative by creating the digital event and managing a dedicated page on Facebook, designing the visual identity for the event, preparing a Google-document application and managing the Facebook event and page for more than 15 days. The Facebook page of the event https://www.facebook.com/syrian.bloggers/ 
was ‘liked’ and followed by more than 700 people, while 500 were going or interested in going to the event, which was 40 times shared on social media. A media article on the competition is available at:https://www.facebook.com/222321052599/posts/10156038809742600/. 

Also, within the context of access constraints UNICEF optimized the use of third-party monitoring and facilitators to conduct timely multi-sectoral assessments at sites for the internally displaced and newly accessible areas, in order to identify main needs and respond accordingly. The facilitators were critical in supporting UNICEF monitoring on the ground and data collection for effective and evidence-based programme delivery. 

UNICEF invested in capacity development for national implementing partners on the use of the harmonized approach to cash transfers. UNICEF selected 13 national NGOs and provided them with training in financial management and internal control capacity. 

UNICEF also promoted integrated community engagement initiatives throughout the reporting year, such as the one in Deir-ez-Zor, where the majority of the population is represented by returnees who fled the country during the crisis in 2012 and 2013. The primary scope of the initiative is to generate awareness among the communities on services available for health, nutrition, WASH, child protection and education, to improve utilization of these services. With the same motive, an integrated initiative at household level was launched in Deir-ez-Zor in July 2018 through consultation meetings with four ministries and six NGOs, followed by training and the development and implementation of micro-plans. As a result, by the end of November 615 children under five had been identified as defaulters from immunization and 418 as out-of- school children. Community workers were able to reach the parents/caregivers of these children and provide them with necessary information about immunization and school enrolment, in addition to referral cards for health centres and schools. UNICEF will scale up this intervention in other geographical areas in 2019. 

Another important lesson learned from the continuous emergency response that UNICEF promptly undertook all over the country was the importance of investing time and resources in the development of a high-quality preparedness response plan. Overall, the integrated response to the countless sudden emergencies that took place in 2018 was a success for UNICEF Syria made possible as a result of the preparation of 15 plans for short- and long-term preparedness for emergency response. For example, the emergency response in Goutha was based on an integrated response plan that represented outstanding coordination among sectors, sections and field offices. This successful experience was then replicated for other crises, including the complex organization of delivery of short-term assistance to Rukban. Moreover, as part of the ‘Whole of Syria’ operation UNICEF Syria developed a preparedness plan permitting support for up to 400,000 displaced people (200,000 from Syria and 200,000 through cross-border operations) in case of escalation of the conflict. A key element of all UNICEF emergency interventions was to ensure a sustainable response, linked to the longer- term (such as the intervention in Eastern Goutha). 

UNICEF was also constantly engaged in ensuring respect for the principle of accountability to affected populations. UNICEF ensured that populations were involved in all stages of its interventions, from planning through implementation, and that feedback was collected to make sure that needs had been addressed in the best way. One example is the response in East Goutha, where UNICEF engaged in a consultation with the communities specifically to identify the most appropriate hygiene items to be provided through the response. Several focus group discussions were organized with community members, which resulted in a series of practical recommendations for fine-tuning the response in line with actual needs. Consultations with the affected populations contributed to better inform the response and helped UNICEF to respond to actual need, as perceived by the affected populations, which expressed strong appreciation for the discussions and consultations. 

UNICEF supported a programme evaluation of the back-to-learning initiative in Syria from 2013–2016, covering key components of the programme such as the provision of school supplies, C4D and support for school rehabilitation. The purpose of the evaluation was to assess the programme’s relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, coverage, coordination, sustainability and impact over a four-year period. The evaluation is expected to provide evidence for decision-makers regarding the extent to which BTL contributed to a change in the number of children enrolled in school and recommendations for adjustments or new approaches for the initiative. The final report is expected to be available in Q1 of 2019. 

In addition, UNICEF continued to work on the management response and implementation of recommendations from the national survey on disabilities in Syria conducted in 2017.

In October 2018 UNICEF initiated a situation analysis on children in Syria as an important contribution to shaping national development strategies to accelerate equitable achievement of the child-related Sustainable Development Goals and support risk-informed programming. A zero draft was available by end-December; the final version is expected to be available during the first quarter of 2019.

MENAR,Tunisia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Tunisia’s transition to democracy offers opportunities for the realization of children’s rights. The 2014 Constitution underscores children’s rights as well as new laws including violence against women and on the independent commission for human rights. Numerous reforms including in education, health, justice, and social protection have been initiated. The 2016 National Development Plan’s focus on social cohesion, equity and gender equality also presents positive opportunities. In addition, the transition has fostered a political opening to tackle issues previously considered taboo, including violence against children.

UNICEF Tunisia took advantage of the changing context by repositioning itself and diversifying partnerships by engaging with civil society, media, children and adolescents. The office undertook many pieces of research previously not possible to conduct on issues including children out-of-school, child poverty and the viability of data. The findings contributed to the articulation of UNICEF’s programme niche. This also allowed for positioning the office as a knowledge broker and convener in social and child protection, early childhood education and in education sector reforms. New programme strategies were put forward such as modelling, provision of high calibre technical expertise in emerging areas such as early childhood education, remedial education for out-of-school adolescents, justice for children and adolescents, violence against children and social inclusion. Efforts were also undertaken to contribute to strengthening coordination, dialogue and partnerships with various stakeholders, notably between Government and civil society. UNICEF’s technical and convener roles were acknowledged during the adoption in 2018 of Tunisia’s multi-sector ECD national strategy and action plan. The strategy developed through a consultative and decentralized approach and involved various actors within Government as well as civil society, private sector and the World Bank.

Since 2016, UNICEF has leveraged millions of US dollars from international finance institutions and bilateral donors for children and adolescents, as well as increased by three fold its country programme ceiling. These changes have forced UNICEF to adjust through deployment of additional expertise at both national and international levels. Although UNICEF Tunisia attempted to adopt and innovate within a fast changing external and internal environment, it could have benefited from a solid political economic and change management analysis to tackle more effectively the widespread and unfolding challenges. 

Eight years after the Spring Revolution, UNICEF Tunisia still strives to achieve results for children and adolescents, while operating in an environment with significant challenges and changes, including: 
Regular reshuffling within Government - ten since 2011; 
Safety and security remaininga concern, despite substantive progress; 
Deepening economic crisis,with peaks in food commodities, a high debt burden, and widespread youth unemployment; 
A striking decline in human capital (MICS6), especially children’s learning outcomes, immunization rates, and water quality, which all require urgent investments; 
Growing social unrest, youth discontent, polarization of the education sector and the rise in suicide and illegal migration including of adolescents- all of which are impacting the pace of the implementation of the much-needed reforms and the economic growth. 

These external factors were also accompanied by internal constraints as UNICEF Tunisia was managing its own transition from a small team into a team of more than 30 staff. The office encountered many challenges in managing the transition and rapid and innovative programme changes. Adopting to a new pace has proven more demanding than expected. The integration of new members of the team was at the time seen as a threat to the routine work practices; and the rapid and innovative programmatic changes were also seen as a constraint after a decade of ‘business as useful’. This was coupled with the external environment, which on one hand offered new opportunities for the realization of children’s rights and on the other hand the social, economic and political situation affected partners’ motivation and performance.

This called upon the UNICEF Tunisia to invest more in staff well-being in its drive for achieving results for children and adolescents. This is gradually being done with the commitment of both staff association and management through the conduct of “speak up” workshops facilitated with support from UNICEF MENARO (notably the staff counsellor); establishment of a well-being committee to monitor that a set of agreed actions including from the staff survey results are implemented; induction clinics, including orientation on career development; facilitation of exchanges with other country offices; encouragement of staff to take leave; provision of leadership and expertise to the local salary survey committee; establishment of key positions and deployment of experienced managers. These investments must be continued and sustained as the journey to change is a lengthy process, especially in a tense and difficult external environment where the demand for achieving results for children and adolescents continues to rise. 2019 offers opportunities for further shaping the strategic direction of the programme as per the outcome of the 2018 MTR, as well as consolidating and continuing investing in the team’s well-being. 







"
MENAR,Yemen,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Yemen is a complex implementing context, with a protracted conflict and low-level baseline indicators for child rights pre-conflict, now exacerbated by years of instability and collapsing systems. 

Ongoing challenges included navigating political divisions across the country and the existence of two authorities (de facto in Sana'a and internationally recognized government in Aden). The economic instability, in particular the fluctuating value of the currency in 2018, had a significant impact on UNICEF programming. Alongside the devaluation of the Yemeni Rial and rising inflation, over 1.25 million civil servants in public sector have not been paid salaries (or paid only partially, and primarily in the south) for more than two years. This has weakened institutions and reduced their capacity to deliver much-needed services to the people of Yemen.

Community level engagement, especially related to accountability for affected populations was challenging, primarily due to the reluctance of key actors to facilitate access. While coordination of social and behaviour change intervention at governorate and district levels was effective and efficient, at the national level the coordination of development and some humanitarian interventions led by the Health Education Centre remained a challenge in 2018. This was due to the reluctance of authorities to engage other government and civil society organization partners for the implementation of social and behaviour change interventions. To address this issue, other coordination mechanisms such as the Hygiene Promotion Technical Working Group to coordinate interventions for WASH-related behaviours and practices were established. The high attrition of trained community volunteers due to unattractive incentives, coupled with the denial of access to partners in some areas, were also bottlenecks to effective community engagement. For example, in Hodeida Governorate, due the ongoing conflict, about 20 per cent of community volunteers moved to other governorates. The situation was further compounded by lack of accurate data on the community volunteer’s location, overall capacity needs and other critical information. A mapping exercise conducted in late 2018 facilitated a database of community volunteers, their contacts, locations and level of training in community engagement and behaviour change. This will allow the program to institute a system for strengthening their capacity, including the payment of incentives to volunteers.

In 2018, access remained a key constraint to implementation and added strain on affected populations. Physical access to parts of the country was restricted due to the volatile security situation coupled with fuel shortages and damaged infrastructure. Access was also limited by bureaucratic procedural requests, including delays in approval of sub-agreements, visa restrictions on international staff, amongst others.

In response to the numerous constraints, and building upon experience of previous years, UNICEF Yemen identified several lessons that guided its programming in 2018 and will shape that in 2019.

While Yemen’s internationally recognized government is currently located in Aden, UNICEF has maintained a strong presence in Sana’a working with the authorities based there, who have approximately 70 per cent of the population living in areas under their control. Working across political lines requires diplomacy and regular monitoring of the political environment. To improve relations and effective cooperation with the internationally recognised government, in 2018, UNICEF made concerted efforts to enhance its presence in Aden, through its field office as well as regular higher-level representation. This is strengthening the relationship and creating greater opportunity for collaboration and coordination in Yemen moving into 2019.

In the context of programming in conflict, UNICEF respects the redlines in line with International Humanitarian Law and international human rights. These redlines are critical for UNICEF’s credibility as a human rights organization and must be adhered to not only for Yemen but for the precedents it could set for other conflict settings. Equally, UNICEF has found that it is important for donors and development partners to show a united front on non-negotiables or redlines with parties to the conflict.  

Considering the risk of aid diversion, UNICEF Yemen further strengthened its assurance systems. The harmonised approach to cash transfers (HACT) performance for 2018 exceeding the planned annual targets for all four its assurance activities. UNICEF managed to conduct 139 out of the 126 spot checks required in 2018 (110 per cent) and 1,280 programmatic visits - 295 per cent of the annual target of 434. Additionally, UNICEF strengthened its systems to prevent and detect cases of alleged diversion. The internal staff capacity was increased in this area by the recruitment of an internal controls specialist and an expanded HACT team.

A central lesson learned is the need and ability for UNICEF to think and act out of the box in complex and constraining environments. Without UNICEF’s bold decision to seek support for teachers’ incentives, despite the risks and initial lack of support, the education system could have collapsed with the absence of teaching personnel from school. With persistent advocacy, negotiation, alliance-building and the demonstrated ability to deliver while mitigating risks, UNICEF has convinced donors who were initially reluctant to support the approach and mobilized the US$70 million required to cover the 2018/2019 school year. UNICEF will continue to creatively programme and respond to the evolving needs in Yemen in 2019.

UNICEF is mitigating the constraints posed by lack of payments of civil servant salaries within a limited scope by paying incentives to specific cadres of civil servants, such as teachers, and health workers, as a strategy to keep services functioning. The incentives do not replace salaries, but are intended to support civil servants to continue in their role and to an extent sustain the fragile, yet functioning systems so that the children and families can access health and education services. While there are risks inherent with incentive payments and it is a short-term solution, UNICEF has put into place risk mitigation strategies and assessed the short-term support as critical to longer-term systems preservation. Now that the structures are in place to deliver incentives, exploratory discussions on support for other publicsector employees (potentially in WASH) will take place in 2019.

Complementary to incentive payments, UNICEF identified that covering specific operational costs, such as for health facilities or local water corporations, allows the service centres to continue functioning. Most public service providers have no revenue or recurrent budget, thus threatening the delivery of services. By covering the basic operational costs, UNICEF has been able to keep these services functioning. As with incentives, this is a short-term solution aimed at preserving systems to be strengthened in a post-conflict period.

The successful delivery of two payment cycles as part of the Emergency Cash Transfer project  provided an opportunity for UNICEF Yemen to leverage the existing delivery mechanism and systems to distribute cash for other sectors with the necessary risk mitigation measures in place. Plans are underway to use this delivery mechanism for the proposed payment of incentives to teachers and education staffin 2019. 

To improve its immediate respond to humanitarian needs, UNICEF expanded the piloted Rapid Response Mechanism with a consortium of three internationalNGOs (ACF, Oxfam, ACTED), with anUS$$8 million partnership. The RRM covered nine governorates in both the north and south of Yemen with a package of supply and services. Based on successful implementation of the programme, the consortium will be expanded to sixinternational NGOs in 2019 to ensure greater coverage across the country.

The communication for development strategy was revised to focus on a limited number of high-impact low-cost core family practices delivered through innovative interactive and sustainable approaches. This is building upon the lesson that due to the limited reach of electronic mass media as well as poor access of households to electricity and other forms of energy, there is a need for interpersonal communication approaches that directly reach parents and caregivers, such as the human resource-intensive house-to-house visits. 

The challenges and delays experienced with re-programming the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) and Education Cannot Wait (ECW) funded project highlight the need for global initiatives to take into consideration and adapt their approaches to country realities, in particular those experiencing conflict and political instability.  

Humanitarian access remained a challenge for UNICEF. To work around this, UNICEF continued to engage third party firms to enhance its presence and effectiveness and to monitor activities, as well as deployed facilitators in hard-to-reach areas through third-party human resource management. Third party monitoring presents a set of unique opportunities and challenges as the number of companies in Yemen are limited. However, moving into 2019, UNICEF will explore expanding the network and developing the capacity of new third-party monitor providers. Internal challenges such as limitations on the number of international staff, particularly in Sana’a also continued to present an implementation bottleneck.

A balanced approach to decentralize decision-making at field office level has been adopted in 2018, with investments in additional human resources and capacity building. As a result, the accountability as well as programme delivery improved and aligned to the local context, which differs significantly from district to district. It allowed for a more rapid provision of humanitarian responses and stronger engagement with communities and authorities for feedback, greater local ownership of interventions, facilitated access negotiation and improved value-for-money.

The role of external communication is central to UNICEF’s positioning for advocacy and perception monitoring. Building on its credibility and benefiting from its field presence, UNICEF fed content to local and international media outlets. UNICEF was regularly contacted for comments and information for press briefings or high-level meetings. Twenty press statements were produced (in English and Arabic), 13 of which were dispatched by UNICEF headquarters and regional office and circulated. An advocacy strategy was produced following wide discussion and consultations within and across offices. The strategy set clear advocacy priorities based on key issues of children, objectives to achieve, a mix of public and bilateral actions to take at various levels of the organization and a clear breakdown of audience. This ensured a focused, coherent and concerted engagement on issues of children, hence positioning UNICEF as a strong and credible voice on and for children.

UNICEF Yemen was fortunate to receive multiple grants and support from the donor community to implement its humanitarian action and non-emergency programming. However, given the complex implementing environment and its unpredictability, the most effective funding would be multi-year funding with less stringent conditions. Such funding would be better aligned with UNICEF’s longer-term programming plans and vision and taking into consideration the implementation complexities in Yemen. Going forward, this will be at the centre of dialogue with donors as well as relevant stakeholders within UNICEF.

"
SAR,Afghanistan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
The year marked the second year of programme implementation following the Mid-Term Review in 2017. Afghanistan remained a complex and rapidly evolving context. Several lessons were drawn from the implementation of the programme this year, which will guide the work and role of UNICEF for the rest of the country programme cycle. 

The first lesson was the need to exercise cautious optimism, as well as realistic and flexible targeting within the highly volatile and fragile situation in Afghanistan and the difficulties of the operating environment. Two examples are programming for polio eradication and roll out of the community-based nutrition package.  

Following three years of progressive improvement in the overall polio situation as evidenced by a reduction in the number of polio cases from 23 in 2015, 13 in 2016 and 14 in 2017, the overall geographic restriction of poliovirus, steady improvement in campaign quality indicators, and improvements in population immunity and vaccine acceptance, the 2018 target was to stop transmission by the end of the year. However, during 2018 Afghanistan faced an upsurge in polio cases, accounting for 21 of the 29 cases of polio recorded globally. The majority of the cases werein the south of the country, where there has been a ban on house-to-house campaigns since May, as well as an increase in refusals. Prior to the ban, the number of inaccessible children was the lowest it has been in more than two years. The mobility of populations within Afghanistan and across the border with Pakistan continued to present a risk for the programme, particularly in the eastern region. This phenomenon contributed to new circulation registered in the province of Nuristan which had been polio-free since 2009. The deteriorating security situation, particularly in the south of the country, as well as the difficulties encountered in gaining access to some areas, contributed to increased restrictions, resulting in  over one million children missing out on vaccination, with the inevitable upsurge in polio cases. It is important to note though that 96 per cent of the country is polio-free. Significant efforts continue to be made to try and resolve the resistance to house-to-house campaigns and to dialogue for uncompromised access. There is incredible pressure to get to zero cases by all global stakeholders. Setting realistic targets within a highly complex, volatile environment and ensuring thorough estimates of potential residual risks are crucial for the reputation of UNICEF. 

In the case of the limited implementation of the community-based nutrition package in the field, this was largely due to the limited number and capacities of partners and the difficulties associated with working at community level in Afghanistan. The small size of communities coupled, with them being widely spread across difficult, hard-to-reach and sometimes impossible terrain, meant that many communities could not be reached with nutrition actions. 

Within the One UN framework, UNICEF Afghanistan has tried as much as possible to look and consider Afghanistan as a development programme in a fragile context. During 2018, the key changes made in 2017 at the Mid-Term Review were found to be justifiable, notably the need to make a paradigm shift into “a continuum of development work, resilience-building, and scaled up humanitarian responses to children affected by both acute and protracted emergency situations”. This shift includes realistic and flexible target setting. This is something which UNICEF will continue to be more aware of in the future, if the current trends of the overall situation in Afghanistan continue. 

The second lesson learned is the engagement of UNICEF Afghanistan in actions pertaining to the humanitarian-development nexus, as recommended by the Mid-Term Review.  There are several examples, including the expansion of the paradigm of nutrition action to focus not only on treatment of children with severe acute malnutrition, but also to focus on prevention. This allows for eventual reduction of expenses related to treatment and focusing on more long-term solutions. This has been fully embraced by the Government, especially the Ministry of Public Health, as well as the national food security and nutrition agenda. Similarly, an important action undertaken this year in response to the drought situation in the west of Afghanistan was the introduction of the treatment of children with severe acute malnutrition to the level of the health sub-centre. This was a measure taken by UNICEF in the province of Badghis in western Afghanistan to enable the treatment of a larger number of children, since there were not enough health centres to deliver the services required. The action has proved to be quite successful so far. Advocacy efforts are underway, including with the World Bank, to take this to scale. Should the government buy-in continue, what started as an emergency action to deal with an increasing number of severely malnourished children in one area of the country could result in treatment of larger numbers across the country, and at lower cost.  

Another good practice in the context of the drought response, in which the Child Protection Action Networks and the social workers that had both been nurtured by UNICEF as part of the regular development programme have been engaged in responding to the large-scale displacement that took place in Herat province due to the drought. The CPAN and the social workers became the forefront of identifying and addressing major child protection issues among the displaced children. The CPAN members moved to the internally displaced persons settlements and engaged with the communities to prevent negative coping mechanisms such as early marriage, child labour and child recruitment by armed groups and armed forces. This demonstrated the benefits of the development investment into such structures that were beneficial at the time of the crisis. The country programme has rich examples of humanitarian-development nexus for which support has been requested from UNICEF ROSA to document during 2019. 

The third lesson learned in 2018 relates to positioning UNICEF as the lead voice and advocate and seizing relevant opportunities to speak out on behalf of children in Afghanistan. This includes both public advocacy by highlighting the situation of children in Afghanistan through the media – both national and international – and silent diplomacy through quiet advocacy with key influencers in Government and diplomatic circles. There was significant increase in public advocacy efforts with traditional and social media, especially with the compelling evidence provided by the Out-of-School Study, Child Marriage Study, assessment of humanitarian response and the menstrual hygiene management guidelines, most of which were either the first-ever or first in decades. These reports positioned UNICEF as a knowledge leader for children, duly recognized by the Government, donors and other partners. UNICEF was also vocal on the attack on schools andon children, and developed comprehensive question and answers, quick facts and position papers on sensitive issues impacting on the rights and well-being of children. Silent diplomacy was key in navigating the polio eradication quagmire, engaging around children on the move and advocacy around the Afghanistan Child Protection Act, though the latter has still not been passed by Parliament. Despite the progress made, there is a need to speak out and engage more boldly on the rights and well-being of children. Some key lessons include the need to: 
Invest in research and data management to distil reliable and credible data in a timely an efficient manner. This applies to all areas, but particularly for child protection, due largely to dysfunctional systems for data collection;  
Mitigate a risk aversive attitude which has been in place for many years because of the operating environment when it comes to speaking out;  
More strategically invest in identifying, compiling and simplifying the key messages for which advocacy needs to be conducted.  

For example, the considerable number of civilians and members of the national security forces killed in Afghanistan in 2018 has orphaned many children who may lose opportunities and be deprived of their basic right to a normal childhoodand access to basic social services. There is no data relating to this, nor is there any clarity about what is offered to the children of those who are killed. Having such information would have enabled UNICEF to speak more on their behalf. The Group of Friends of Children Affected by Armed Conflict, which is headed by Sweden, progressively increased its engagement during the year to bring the agenda to the forefront and to foster stronger alliances to speak out on behalf of those children. Afghanistan remains a complex and dynamically evolving context which constantly requires strong political acumen on when and how to speak out as well as proactively responding to competing priorities. These priorities include the unprecedented levels of drought and the impact on vulnerable populations across the country, the significant spike in violence and deterioration in security, addressing polio eradication, as well as balancing of programme continuity and staff safety.  While the country programme has focused on programme implementation and support to service delivery, advocacy and speaking out about and on behalf of children – a normative role of UNICEF – requires dedicated investment and capacities both at national and sub national levels. 

The fourth lesson is about the importance of partnerships to achieve better results for children. In a country like Afghanistan with competing priorities for children, it is not possible to work without relying on partnerships. While the partnership with Government is steady and UNICEF works hard to strengthen it at central level in Kabul and in provinces, there is a need to explore and expand partnerships outside this domain. Efforts need to be made to work more with civil society at grassroots level. Many of the country programme and humanitarian results require some behavioural change, which must be addressed at the level of the community. Hence, civil society is an important and critical partner. There is also a need to forge a stronger partnership with the media so that the voice for children and their priorities is amplified. A partnership strategy with key influencers such as parliamentarians, religious leaders and the media will be put in place in 2019. 

The fifth lesson learnt had been the added value of UN Volunteers and interns. This year the human resource team conducted six field visits to various tertiary institutions across the country sharing the work of UNICEF and the role of young people. This resulted in UNICEF hosting 26 interns this year, 19 of whom were female, and several of them were based in the field.

The sixth and arguably the most important lesson relates to working on the flagship results that were adopted by UNICEF Afghanistan as a key outcome of the Mid-Term Review carried out in 2017, to ensure greater efficiency and effectiveness in achieving results for children. Strategic reflection was undertaken on the initial implementation of the flagship results approach in 2018, following the mid-year review. It revealed that achievement of those flagship results required strengthening management. Geographical convergence and siloed, multisectoral convergence (by listing and doing several activities together) was not enough to make the required change to deliver the flagship results for children.  UNICEF Afghanistan therefore engaged the services of a consultant to undertake a review of the working modality on the flagships, supporting clear articulation of the what and how, including required shifts and the investment needed to drive results. Some of the changes proposed and adopted included a shift from multisectoral approaches, which maintains the silos, to intersectoral approaches, where the result is collectively owned across all sections; as well as the establishment of four intersectoral flagship task forces. The purpose of these task forces is coordination across programmes, sections and field office, as well as the identification, implementation, and monitoring of high impact, catalytic, intersectoral approaches and actions that will lead to the achievement of the flagship results.  

The task forces will report regularly to the country management team on progress in overcoming barriers and moving towards the identified changes through the intersectoral approaches. They will also undertake joint resource mobilization and work closely with the communication, advocacy and civic engagement section to strengthen advocacy, raise awareness and mobilize Government, influencers and other partners on the prioritization of resources, investments and inter-sectoral collaboration among partners to achieve flagship results for children in Afghanistan. It is expected that these task forces will start meeting in 2019, with their performance closely monitored to obtain the desired results.

"
SAR,Bangladesh,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Partnerships in 2018 presented both challenges and advantages; working through effective partnerships continued to grant UNICEF Bangladesh myriad opportunities to improve the lives of children. Often it was a partnership that helped the country office to overcome common constraints such as limited capacity or lack of coordination in relation to development or humanitarian efforts. In the context of the Rohingya crisis, frequent inter-agency collaboration, multi-sectoral interaction for joint supply chain mapping, use of a common logistics hub, establishment of storage outposts in and around camps, and use of LTAs for common service sharing were absolutely critical to overcoming supply chain management bottlenecks and ensuring rapid scale-up of the emergency response. 

Bringing together key partners – both relevant ministries and development partners – in a national consultation to develop a new and unique programme, and building a strategic partnership with the ILO were key factors underlying the rapid scale-up of the Mothers@Work programme. Establishing other strong partnerships with garment/knitting associations could, however, have helped to increase programme uptake across the ready-made garment sector. From a strategic communication point of view, engaging a media agency to develop a brand using social and behaviour change approaches for the programme supported UNICEF’s efforts to raise awareness about Mothers@Work among ready-made garment sector stakeholders.

Achieving the SDG targets for WASH is far more challenging than the equivalent MDG targets. More than 20 per cent of Bangladesh is rated as extremely or very hard to reach with water and sanitation services, affecting 28.6 million people. The situation in urban slums is particularly precarious, characterized by low access and a need for significantly improved faecal sludge and solid waste management practices. As a first step to identifying the right interventions and strategies, the bottlenecks analyses conducted in 2018 were critical. Preliminary findings from the workshops reveal that lack of knowledge about WASH and low access to improved WASH facilities are key factors that negatively impact on the health and nutrition status of people in Bangladesh. Other factors – including poverty, rapid urbanization, declining water levels and vulnerability to climate change/natural hazards– exacerbate an already challenging situation. Moving forward, consultations will be organized to build consensus about bottlenecks that are preventing the attainment of the SDG targets for WASH and to develop costed solutions for accelerating progress. 

In the area of C4D, ongoing and consistent engagement with stakeholders and partners proved necessary to ensure sustainability and scale (especially with the Government), leverage resources and assure quality (as, for example, with the private sector). In particular, adopting a public–private partnership approach enabled UNICEF to expand the reach and intensity of media dissemination in 2018: UNICEF aired all newborn health and end child marriage campaign broadcasts on all channels in prime-time slots, and the adolescent empowerment entertainment-education drama series was telecast weekly on four channels, free of charge and at prime time. One important way to foster close relationships was arranging joint visits and assessments with partners to inform and accelerate programme implementation, as was the case with the partnership with Bangladesh’s Islamic Foundation, which started off slowly. Sharing successes with partners publicly strengthens ownership: Government involvement and ownership of the end child marriage campaign increased significantly after the campaign won awards. 

Behaviour change is a long-term and complex process that requires investment not only in intensive and repetitive messaging and dialogue, but also to ensure the availability of services and a supportive environment. Lack of access to services or inadequate service provision, combined with incomplete information, can breed resentment and mistrust, leading to myths, rumours and misconceptions. Communities should be able to provide feedback that is valued and acted upon by service providers. Investment in feedback loops and grievance mechanisms are essential to fulfil the principle of accountability to affected populations and as a strategy to ensure the long-term effectiveness of efforts. Building the trust of communities in service providers, through dialogue and by engaging community leaders and influencers, is central to creating a supportive environment for sustainable behaviour change.

Lack of capacity remains a key challenge in several areas. It is a critical time for education reform, with important opportunities for change, and all three levels of the education system have developed strategic plans slated for implementation in 2018/19. The education system is struggling, however, to effectively operationalize multiple new strategies. This is made more difficult by frequent changes in key personnel in critical agencies: the knowledge gaps that result affect the pace and quality of implementation. This high turnover is a common phenomenon and reinforces the need to invest in system-strengthening. Similarly, challenges to strengthening the child protection system relate mainly to inadequate human resources – both in number and capacity. The child protection system mapping exercise that began in late 2018 will further guide the strengthening of government services and the development of costed action plans. 

Insufficient coordination continues to pose a significant challenge, for example, among the multiple ministries with responsibility for education and skills-related services. UNICEF’s work to support inter-ministerial coordination between MoWCA and 15 related ministries, showed that coordination support is most effective when built on interventions that are beneficial to all parties (e.g., generating evidence, modelling initiatives, building capacity). Furthermore, while schools are a platform for expanding the reach of the adolescent nutrition programme, barriers include education sector managers’ lack of knowledge about the importance of adolescent nutrition, a limited budget allocation and poor coordination between relevant ministries and departments. UNICEF will support the strengthening of coordination between the MoHFW and the MoE and continue to explore partnerships with other national entities. Coordination is also lacking in nutrition system delivery for urban dwellers; development of a national urban nutrition strategy with clear accountability among ministries is required.

"
SAR,Bhutan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Overall, a key lesson learned was related to Bhutan’s potential graduation from the status of a least-developed country to a lower-middle-income country: the continual withdrawal of traditional development partners and funding sources during the reporting year. Bhutan has maintained a strong macroeconomic performance, that trickles down to benefit many children and their families over the past two decades, but diminishing funding for the social sector puts results at risk. Acknowledging that support of development partners is required to sustain important socio-economic achievements, UNICEF Bhutan successfully leveraged additional resources for the Government from the Global Fund, GAVI and the Global Partnership for Education, among others. To ensure that declining resources do not strain social expenditure, upstream policy work and especially social policy engagement were crucial in 2018.

Bhutan faces disparities among socio-economic groups, a development constraint despite progress to improve key socio-economic indicators over the last decade, including meeting the Millennium Development Goals on reducing poverty, halving the proportion of underweight children, child mortality and maternal mortality.  

But by wealth alone, average disparities between the richest and poorest quintiles are stark across sectors. Urban/rural inequity persists, underscored by disparities in multi-dimensional poverty index rates of 1.2 per cent in urban centres and 8.1 per cent in rural areas. During the preparation of its new country programme document, UNICEF Bhutan addressed the structural and other challenges that Bhutan faces, with increased up-stream policy and advocacy work, social policy and public finance for children.

Bhutan made progress in strengthening its governance during the reporting year, focusing on decentralization of services through a national decentralization policy that addresses the barriers to access by those who are hardest-to-reach. In line with these ambitions, the 12FYP foresees the potential allocation of 50 per cent of government resources at sub-national level. However, it will remain challenging to strengthen systems and institutions at the local level. 

UNICEF Bhutan focused on addressing insufficient decentralized capacities for equity-based planning, service delivery and monitoring during the preparation of its country programme document. Initial discussions were undertaken with the Gross National Happiness Commission and the Ministry of Finance. Priority will be given to areas lagging in human development, including urban and rural settings, vulnerabilities between population sub-groups, by wealth quintile, location, gender, age, disability and other factors, challenging the “last mile” of development.  

Against this backdrop, to ensure effective development programmes, UNICEF Bhutan enhanced cross-sectoral programming and mainstreamed cross-cutting issues in 2018. Examples include early childhood care and development with focus on early learning and disability, and child protection with a focus on children who live without parental care (including in boarding schools and monastic institutions).

In Bhutan, data scarcity limits programme planning, implementation and monitoring. A first assessment showed that almost half of the Sustainable Development Goal indicators cannot be measured due to a lack of baselines. Responding to these constraints, the Sustainable Development Goal monitoring process provided key lessons learned to engage in the statistical sector and step up dialogue and interventions around data collection in the country. The 12FYP focuses on decentralization and is thus a good opportunity to localize the Sustainable Development Goals, as well as map and monitorSustainable Development Goal indicators at the local level. 

In 2018, in line with the focus on upstream work in the new country programme document, UNICEF Bhutan increased engagement with the National Statistics Bureau on data and analysis, and increased support to development and revision of sector management information systems, including health and education. Partnerships with academia and training policy makers and stakeholders on social policy have set the tone for UNICEF Bhutan’s gradual shift to upstream work and focus on equity. For the first time, an initial work agenda on public finance for children was discussed with the Ministry of Finance. Building on these achievements, the new country programme will focus on evidence-based policy making, information management and accountability systems, to ensure timely and quality information for decision making. 

Recognizing the need to increase upstream policy, the new country programme includes an outcome on social policy. With the risk that budget allocation for the social sectors may not be reached, UNICEF Bhutan invested in building partners’ capacity for evidence-based, gender-responsive policy and budgeting. The interventions intensify in the new programme, including more support to the Ministry of Finance in public finance for children. Other components for an enabling environment such as the production, use and quality of evidence on vulnerable groups and high-level advocacy, will also be enhanced. 

Bhutan is a seismically-active zones and vulnerable to earthquakes, along with other disasters. In the development of the country programme, UNICEF Bhutan emphasized disaster risk reduction and strengthened cross-sector linkages and coordination for emergency preparedness and response. In 2018, the establishment of an incident command system laid the foundation to improve communication, coordination and response mechanisms during emergencies at the national and district levels.

"
SAR,India,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
The year under review reconfirmed the importance of some key lessons and highlighted some new areas for reflection. One of the factors crucial to programme delivery is high-level political and bureaucratic commitment by Government, requiring sustained advocacy based on data and evidence. This was exemplified across numerous sectors during 2018.

For example, in the health sector the renewed and intense focus on the immunization programme was largely the result of political commitment coming from the highest level in the Government, with close engagement from the office of prime minister. The convening role played by the health minister at the national level, along with engagement by chief secretaries for regular review, were critical factors providing the needed impetus to both Mission Indradhanush and the MR campaign. Similarly, close engagement by the office of the prime minster was also a major factor in ensuring that many ministries and departments engaged in POSHAN Abhiyaan and supported accelerated roll-out of nutrition-sensitive and -specific interventions. Convergent action plans on nutrition at both state and district levels brought together initiatives from the different ministries and departments. 

The Government’s embrace of social-and behaviour-change communication as part of key flagship programmes ensured translation of interventions from the national down to the Gram Panchayat level, as required for behaviour change. This was exemplified in MR and SBM guidelines, BRIDGE training guidelines, POSHAN Abhiyaan Jan Andolan guidelines and dashboards. 

Child-sensitive social protection was put on the policy table by UNICEF at both national and state levels through UNICEF-assisted evidence generation. Building strategic evidence in parallel to initiating policy dialogue with senior levels of the Government for integrated and child-sensitive social protection programmes was found to be an effective way to encourage the review and redesign of social protection programmes targeting children. 

In the WASH sector consistent advocacy efforts for policy-level changes based on data and evidence helped to secure funding for WASH O&M in schools and for making raw data available publicly.

Another lesson learned was the critical nature of catalytic funding for accelerating programme results. For example, catalytic funding by Gavi was instrumental in fast-tracking roll out of newer vaccines and bridging the resource gap for the immunization programme. The momentum and political commitment generated for the immunization programme (due to Mission Indradhanush) and the MR campaign must now be utilized to strengthen the routine immunization programme, to sustain coverage gains.

Also reconfirmed during 2018 was the power of social media, influencers and media partnerships to contribute to positive (and negative) programme outcomes. For example, social media played an important role in the success of the MR campaign, but its use by the anti-vaccine lobby has emerged as a major challenge, with the spread of negative news and rumours on WhatsApp occasionally impacting the campaign. UNICEF played a key role in handling media engagement and response, including designing and implementing a social media strategy to address negative messages and rumour-mongering. UNICEF took the lead in supporting national and state governments to create awareness and dispel myths, through a social media strategy and by engaging print and broadcast media using clear evidence, facts and figures.

This year also highlighted the importance of data analysis contextualized to India’s situation and use of monitoring information and research. For example, in the nutrition sector, data analyses over the past year provided important insights into the etiology of acute malnutrition. In South Asia, unlike in sub-Saharan Africa, SAM prevalence peaks during the first month after birth and steadily declines to 5 per cent at 12 months. A proportion of SAM cases in children six months and older reveal persistent or chronic low weight for height (a global definition of SAM). The rapid decline of SAM leads to a lower mortality among children with SAM after six months compared to other countries. It is also increasingly recognized that the presence of a wide scope of community- and facility-based health and nutrition programmes in India provide an opportunity for a unique approach to SAM prevention and management. When the draft CMAM guidelines are finalized and implemented, UNICEF will continue supporting government by generating evidence permitting better understanding of SAM and ensuring that appropriate responses are provided within the local context. 

Implementing the programme to end child marriage at scale yielded important lessons generated from data analysis, monitoring of programme interventions and research. The single most important learning was the need to better understand what accelerators of change work at scale, as well as what are the most effective and cost-effective interventions. UNICEF and partners have sufficient evidence on what works at a small scale to reduce child marriage through high-intensity interventions in specific contexts (e.g. community mobilization to promote dialogue and behaviour change; empowering adolescents with information and skills,). Some important areas for further evidence include the inclusion of ‘plus’ elements (in cash plus programmes), which may optimize the effect of cash grants on incentivizing adolescent girls’ education and opportunities. 

Building and strengthening partnerships, and UNICEF’s key role in supporting coordination and collaboration among stakeholders at central and community levels, was again highlighted in 2018 as critical to achieving programmatic results. Partnerships with national institutions (e.g., National Institute of Rural Development, Panchayat Raj and Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration) presented UNICEF with an opportunity not only to collaborate in building the capacity of policy-makers, but also to effectively enhance cross-cutting work within UNICEF. Based on this learning, coherent and coordinated approaches will be further enhanced through development of a common strategy across programmes and field offices to contribute to these partnerships. 

The national achievement survey, which assessed 2.2 million children on a single day and produced results in the lowest possible turnaround time, was possible only because key decision-makers and agencies at national and state levels worked in smooth coordination and also involved district decision-makers. 

To operationalize strategies in adolescent programming, UNICEF engaged in large scale, multi-stakeholder technical partnerships with state governments and district administrations to work with adolescent girls and boys, parents, community structures and front-line workers. This points to an evolving role for NGOs, from direct implementation to working as technical partners of the Government, and the importance of a CSO alliance. This shift drastically reduced UNICEF’s costs and increased coverage. 

In the WASH sector 2018 demonstrated that sustaining sanitation gains, especially in rural areas, requires continuous engagement with communities achieving ODF status. For this, engaging and adequately incentivizing foot-soldiers or ‘Swachhagrahis’ is a critical requirement. Further, it is important to swiftly monitor the toilets built to check for structural issues that may require retrofitting. This is needed to ensure that the technology used and toilets constructed are safe. Involving local government bodies like Gram Panchayats, in these efforts is necessary and therefore an orientation campaign on sustainable ODF for Gram Panchayat representatives is immediately required. Moving forward, greater attention will be placed on other safe sanitation management issues, including solid and liquid waste, faecal sludge, menstrual hygiene and handwashing with soap. With the SBM-G coming to an end in 2019, sources of alternative financing for WASH will need to be explored.

Lessons learned in 2018 highlight the need for a shift in the role of the water supply department in operationalizing community-managed water supply from provider to facilitator. The private sector brings value in terms of community-centred service delivery, but needs to be accountable to communities. This requires non-conventional contract management. The communication and behaviour-change activities must move into campaign mode, focusing on key behaviours such as pay-for-use of safely managed water supply. The sustainability of India’s water supply depends not only on communities’ willingness to pay, but also on openness on the part of the Government to consider charging communities for their water supply.

Programming experience around child marriage and adolescent engagement in 2018 highlighted some new lessons learned that provide insights for future programming. For example, change related to child marriage is possible if it is linked to aspirations and informed choices by adolescent girls, boys and parents – not just enforcement of laws. There is a need to challenge and shift the narrative from the ‘marriage market’ to the market of aspirations and informed choices in life for girls and boys.

While amplifying drivers of change such as education, empowerment of adolescent girls, community mobilization and incentivizing change, a differentiated approach is needed for state and inter-state collaboration based on prevalence and norms. The prevalence of child marriage is high in border districts, and there are links between child marriage and trafficking in a few states. Also to be considered are India’s many highly vulnerable population groups, such as nomadic communities in Rajasthan and Maha Dalit in Bihar, tribal communities in many states and tea garden communities in Assam. 

Addressing implementation gaps and moving from strategies to operational modalities is critical. In states where political commitment exists, the next step is to translate that political capital into sustained action. Some reality checks: (1) quantity and quality of human resources should not be ad-hoc, but rather institutionalized through key existing systems and understood in innovative ways, such as the use of technology and mentoring; (2) planning, budgetary analysis, costing and resourcing should not be exclusively through public sector, but also with CSOs and the private sector; (3) inter-departmental coordination under chief secretaries and district administrations is also critical. It is also important to have a CSO alliance to support the Government to accelerate results; and (4) capacity is required to monitor progress in real time. 

The child protection programme has drawn important lessons from years of investment in promoting the effective implementation of child protection legislation, primarily in collaboration with the judiciary and state governments. Active involvement by the highest levels of the judiciary, with UNICEF technical assistance, to make child protection services more effective masks two important challenges: over-reliance on legal solutions (e.g. court orders/interventions) in the absence of integrated preventive and response services for survivors of sexual violence and exploitation, and overreliance on overburdened statutory child protection bodies that lack the staff and resources to prevent and respond to violence and exploitation. 

UNICEF India has taken decisive steps toward brokering new partnerships to ensure that public services (education, health) and private initiatives contribute toward practical solutions to prevent and respond to violence against and exploitation of children.

SAR,Maldives,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Programme implementation experienced two periods of slowdown in 2018. The unexpected state of emergency declared in early February impeded the implementation of activities, especially with the judiciary and law enforcement agencies. The second slowdown occurred during the run-up to the September presidential election and the following weeks, until the new Government took office in mid-November. There was heightened sensitivity during the run-up to the presidential elections. Some partners became extra cautious about sharing information, such as research findings and reports, as the information could be interpreted in different ways, impact some UNICEF activities. For example, the household income and expenditure survey report was published without the chapter on poverty and data on juvenile crimes were not available for public use. 

At a time of political tension between local councils and central authorities, UNICEF Maldives was able to influence and coordinate some of its multisectoral initiatives, such as the activation of the community social groups, alternative learning programmes for children in conflict with the law and multisectoral training for stakeholders. The lesson learned is that UNICEF must maintain impartiality, remain a trusted interlocutor, and continue to focus on results for children, especially the most vulnerable and disadvantaged. 

To minimize the impact of the slowdown in programme implementation, UNICEF worked directly with service provision agencies. For example, with the main tertiary hospital in Male’ to deliver interventions on child health. In addition, UNICEF opted for direct payment and reimbursement modalities when implementation and reporting-back on cash advances to official bodies was slowed. For some government partners, who were unable to recruit personnel for critical vacant positions, UNICEF assisted through the placement of short-term consultants.

SAR,Nepal,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Theory of change
In 2018, UNICEF implemented the theory of change despite constraints posed by the new federalized structure of the state. UNICEF Nepal continued implementation with little in the way of diversion from plans. The assumptions put into the development of the theory of change are holding true. Consistent evaluation is needed given the changing nature of the environment that UNICEF is operating within.

Cross-cutting strategies
There were valuable lessons gained through the integration of cross-cutting strategies in areas such as health -system strengthening. Embedding community engagement and disaster risk reduction into health programmes proved positive, igniting discussions with local governments on the further development of contingency plans and health strategies at the provincial levels. The cross-cutting approach to interventions targeting children with functional limitations led to significant resource mobilization. Norwegian Government funding will create knowledge on the prevalence of disability across Nepal and empower children with functional limitations to stay in and learn from schools, through the integration of WASH interventions in schools and implementation of inclusive education practice. 

Key constraint: Federalism
The transition from a Unitary Government to the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal provided a host of constraints that UNICEF has had to manage. The functions and financial systems previously managed at the central level are now devolved: this impacted systems, resources and capacity at the local level to absorb these new functions. A lack of awareness, technical expertise and resources constrained capacity. The lack of systems and resources hampered areas such as data management. In certain instances, data collected at local levels for monitoring key indicators was more reliable than data reported through the Government central monitoring system. The transition requires new legislation, institutions and administrative procedures. All three tiers, federal, provincial and local, now have executive, legislative and budgetary powers, together with judicial functions. 

Lessons learned 
Working in collaboration with the three tiers of Government (federal, provincial and local) has been challenging and rewarding. For example, UNICEF Nepal facilitated close collaboration among education cluster members to work with national and local governments and school management committees. This collaboration drove rapid decision-making and solutions. UNICEF Nepal’s established local mechanisms to monitor ‘open defecation free’ status declared by many parts of Nepal. Monitoring is conducted by an independent third-party. Joint monitoring and supervision with local governments helped identify gaps in service quality and delivery, promoting further collaboration.

Capacity building has proven to be a key priority. For example, in the case of nutrition programmes,local-level awarenesswas essential on the importance of investing in nutritional well-being of adolescents, women and children, as was strengthening the capacity of newly -recruited officials to mainstream nutrition into local planning processes. UNICEF Nepal provided technical support to roughly 25 per cent of local governments on child protection issues. To tackle the challenges related to limited capacity of health coordinators and other staff, UNICEF provided technical assistance and conducted onsite coaching and mentoring at health facility levels. In the context of disaster risk reduction, the country office worked on sensitizing and building the capacity of local government officials and elected bodies on risk informed planning and budgeting. 

UNICEF engaged with local governments across the new, federal Nepal with a letter of agreement, a critical component to UNICEF programming for the second half of 2017 and into 2018. An integral part of this engagement included declaring the budget for local municipalities to the Ministry of Finance, ensuring full transparency. The letters of agreement helped secure commitment and accountability from local governments. For example, UNICEF engagement and advocacy with local governments from planning to budgetting helped to prioritize maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health related issues, and sustain results in local governance structures. 

Advocating for the allocation of budget to child-related programmes is essential within the decentralized context. UNICEF Nepal worked to ensure sufficient budget would be allocated for the implementation of the nutrition-specific actions related to the multi-sector nutrition plan and supported local levels to establish the nutrition information system. Consequently, UNICEF was successful in leveraging 29 per cent (US$1.69 million) from 308 local municipalities out of the total funding of US$5.67 million. This was achieved as part of a holistic effort that included all the local elected officials signing of the declaration of commitment to eliminate malnutrition from their municipalities. Another lesson related to the use of advocacy was in relation to UNICEF’s social policy agenda, which was successful in leading the Government to adopt a universal approach to the child grants programme, to be expanded to all districts during the current Country Programme (2018-2022). 

Data collection 
In terms of data collection, there are valuable lessons from an ongoing pilot of the use of RapidPro to link beneficiaries of the child grant programme to an SMS-based information service. This moved slower than planned due to challenges that anon-government organisation partner faced when coordinating 400 local governments. 

Looking ahead
Across all areas of programmes, UNICEF Nepal will continue to focus on providing local level support in the areas of planning, budgeting, implementation, monitoring and reporting whilst strengthening the collaboration across the tiers of Government and bolstering technical and leadership capacity of relevant officials. In tandem with a coordinationrole and providing technical assistance at central, provincial and municipality levels, UNICEF Nepal will monitor the situation at local levels and adapt when required, advocating for change and ensuring that interventions are carried out in timely and efficient manner. Despite challenges, there are valuable lessons that will serve as a basis for future actions, especially to work efficiently in a dynamic environment.

"
SAR,Pakistan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
At the end of the first year of the new country programme, UNICEF Pakistan reflected on the evidence of how its theories of change helped to achieve concrete results for children. Across all programmes, the theories of change in the strategy notes generally were credible and valid. Strengthening institutional structures at the national and subnational levels is a major aspect of UNICEF Pakistan theories of change, given the relevance in the context of the fairly slow development of subnational structures to support children following devolution in 2010. Against this backdrop, UNICEF contributed to creating a conducive environment for achieving results for children through vertical coordination (between the centre and the provinces/districts) and horizontal coordination (between ministries). 

Thus, UNICEF supported the translation of federal policies and strategies on health and nutrition to the provincial levels. It also facilitated Balochistan in sharing lessons learned from its experience of developing Pakistan’s first Convention on the Rights of the Child-aligned child protection legislation. In tandem, UNICEF supported research on the links between WASH, poverty alleviation and other development indicators. Such efforts were accompanied by capacity-building interventions for government counterparts which focused on, for example, enhancing capacities for budget analysis correlated with local deprivations. Programming workshops mainstreamed risk reduction strategies into sectoral work plans, engaging both line ministries and provincial authorities.

In 2018, Pakistan’s first-ever parliamentary resolution on child rights was passed unanimously – a major achievement brought in no small part through UNICEF work with parliamentarians during celebrations for World Children’s Day and Human Rights Day. This promises to break new ground for the child rights agenda in the country. However, such progress will require sustained, serious engagement with parliamentarians. Strengthening the Government for evidence-based decision-making for children also reaped rewards: the Governments of Balochistan and Punjab drafted monitoring and evaluation policies following rigorous, wide-ranging debates on implementation, regulatory measures and institutional frameworks. This was a historic transformation in public sector learning and accountability processes. Long-running support and capacity development contributed to a nationally-coordinated Multiple Indicator Survey Cluster, comprised of provincial surveys completed or underway as of the end of 2018. Full provincial ownership was reflected in the fact that over 80 per cent of the survey’s funding was provided by provincial governments. 

However, complicated vertical structures posed challenges for planning and implementation. This was exacerbated in 2018 by the change of government, with delays in approvals – for example, for the child labour survey – and a high staff turnover and changes in programme/department leadership. This also created opportunities; for instance, strengthened federal support for nutrition and WASH. In 2019, UNICEF will support provincial action to meet sectoral goals and expand the focus on urban children.

Multisectoral nutrition and WASH initiatives through the stunting reduction programme in Sindh showed that working between UNICEF goal areas can deliver results. Using a lifecycle approach, this initiative utilized the service delivery platforms of both sectors to deliver at-scale results. A multisector monitoring and evaluation framework for the Accelerated Action Plan to reduce stunting in Sindh, jointly led by UNICEF nutrition programme and monitoring, evaluation and research programme, built understanding, capacities and appetite for mechanisms to track and evaluate progress. Similar benefits came about through collaborations between UNICEF education programme and WASH to reduce dropout rates and support the health and hygiene needs of adolescent girls through menstruation hygiene management in schools. Recognizing that cross-sector partnerships provide efficient social services, UNICEF Pakistan works with a range of government departments on child protective case management and referral processes.

By working across sectors, UNICEF leveraged existing platforms to reach previously unreached children. This is exemplified by the synergies of efforts to eradicate polio and strengthen routine immunization. The Polio Eradication Initiative’s team of social mobilizers reached children at their doorstep in high-risk communities, often in insecure areas or region’s characterized by low levels of trust in immunization services. UNICEF leveraged its access to identify and target zero-dose children. In areas where coordination was successful, previously unreached groups of children received routine immunization. The polio programme was simultaneously enhanced, reducing the impact of vaccination fatigue. Nonetheless, sustaining gains – such as maintaining vitamin A coverage after polio is eradicated – will require careful planning. It will also require efforts to ensure that the immense knowledge base of Pakistan’s vulnerable districts is not lost when the programme winds down.

Following the development of gender strategies in 2018, the next year will focus on gender results across all UNICEF programming areas, including gender-responsive evaluation and strengthening the gender component of UNICEF advocacy and communications strategy.

While UNICEF theories of change for education are valid overall, the skills-development component of the strategic plan was not adequately reflected in the strategy note. This occurred despite emphasis on the second decade of life, especially for girls. Drawing on the global Generation Unlimited initiative, in 2019 UNICEF will partner with government departments, civil society groups, social enterprises and United Nations agencies to ensure that adolescents have opportunities to access education, training and employment.  

In 2018, initial efforts gauged entry points, engaged with stakeholders and youth-led institutions, and looked at existing models, including Edtech. Support for an enabling policy environment in education, through coordinated Education Sector Plans, was validated through UNICEF’s role as the Global Partnership for Education coordinating agency in all four provinces. UNICEF will continue to facilitate connections between the new Government’s education agenda and provincial Education Sector Plans, using the shared development vision for Pakistan and its commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals. To this end, UNICEF will advocate for efforts to address disconnects between plans and budgets.

UNICEF WASH programme leveraged South-South partnerships to elicit renewed commitments, strengthen national and provincial mechanisms, build capacity in schools and at local level for service delivery, and promote changes in social norms. These approaches reduced open defecation and improved water provision, both issues which disproportionately impact women. The approaches enhanced community understandings of hygiene practices, including among adolescent girls. Social and behavioural change initiatives grounded in communication for development increased knowledge of, and demand for, services among girls and boys, critical to achieving sustainable results. 

UNICEF invested in a multi-channel approach to communication for development, which reached out to entire communities, and combined outreach through innovation, social media and interpersonal communication. This was exemplified in social mobilization campaigns to promote open defecation-free communities and the high coverage of the measles campaign. Such an approach amplified families’ and communities’ voices for change, while expanding the reach of the approach itself. Innovations such as the Generation Unlimited platform will offer new opportunities to reach adolescent girls, co-create solutions and amplify their voices.

UNICEF public-private collaboration with Telenor and the Government illustrates the value of public-private partnerships that leverage innovations within the private sector to effectively and sustainably deliver results. Following the success of a 2015 birth registration pilot, UNICEF technical expertise and advocacy contributed to adapting the digital registration system into a hybrid system, which utilizes both mobile phone-based methods and conventional paper registration to register children’s births. Government’s limited technical capacity and coordination challenges caused delays, addressed through capacity building, particularly on the use of technology. As analysis revealed significant disparities in registration – since more boys and older children were registered than girls or younger children –communication strategies addressed these issues.

UNICEF Pakistan’s focus on evidence-based advocacy for legislation and policy experienced gains in 2018, achieved by strengthening systems, planning and fluid communication. For example, the National Complementary Feeding Assessment findings are already influencing nutrition planning and communication for development efforts in Punjab and Sindh. Gains also include data dashboards to improve education planning in Balochistan, alongside campaign planning for polio and other health interventions nationwide.

As funding streams diminish and a fiscal crisis cuts into government budgets, public-private partnerships and other fundraising modalities – including domestic funding and south-south cooperation in overseas assistance – are essential to ensure that services are maintained and children’s rights are protected. In 2018, UNICEF worked with private sector partners to develop in-country sources of supplies for diarrhoea and pneumonia. The baby-food industry now leverages the ‘1,000 days’ approach for marketing, and it is essential that UNICEF work with the industry to ensure the approach is used to deliver positive results for children. 

Based on lessons learned in 2018, UNICEF will continue to follow the change pathways outlined in its country programme and strategy note, while sharpening its focus on key areas such as early childhood development, gender equality, adolescents, resilience and social policy. It will maintain a focus on communication for development, on developing partnerships (particularly with the private sector) and evidence-based advocacy and innovation. At the same time, UNICEF Pakistan will continue to support the development of strong, effective institutions that respond to the demands of informed and empowered communities to realize the rights of all children in Pakistan.

"
SAR,Sri Lanka,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
To foster convergence in addressing the multidimensional deprivations that affect children, the new UNICEF-Government country programme outcomes were formulated following a child-centred approach. This requires UNICEF to take an integrated approach to programming that combines actions across sectors and involves all relevant stakeholders. With 2018 the first year of the country programme, opportunities were taken to test the cross-sectoral approach in programming. As part of its internal coordination structure, to facilitate the delivery of priorities of the country programme, UNICEF established three outcome groups: one for each of the child-centred outcomes (early childhood, middle childhood and adolescence). The outcome groups function as a programmatic platform to promote convergence between sectors and targeted actions to achieve the integrated results. 

In this context, UNICEF prioritized early childhood development (ECD) to model and demonstrate the integrated, child-centred programming. Playing a convener role and strengthening institutional structures at the national and sub-national levels were key comparative advantages for UNICEF in moving this forward. UNICEF engaged with not only with its regular government partners ( MoWCA, MoHNIM and MoE), but also with less traditional ones such as Ministry of Finance and the National Planning Department to create a more conducive environment through improving horizontal and vertical coordination and committing to key investments to scale up high-quality ECD services for every child in the country. UNICEF contributed substantially to developing new and/or reviewing existing multi-sectoral national policies on ECD and child care, and facilitated sectoral meetings in education, health and child protection and cross-sectoral, multi-stakeholders (government and non-government partners).  

These efforts aimed to enhance capacity for budgetary analysis and to prioritize ECD investment that the Government could make through its 2019 National Budget. In addition, to improve teaching quality, UNICEF in partnership with the ECD Authority of the Uva Province identified and tested a technology-based solution to disseminate the detailed weekly lesson plan for a total of 40 weeks and its accompanying teacher instruction manual based on the Early Childhood Development Standards. Almost every teacher in the registered preschools – more than 90 per cent of preschools are registered in the province – received weekly text messages with the lesson plans and learning activities for each following week. They reported that they appreciated the guidance under the new system. The SMS-based system was enhanced with additional messages on nutrition and/or child protection and there is potential for two-way communication between preschool teachers and ECD authorities in the future.

However, adopting an integrated approach at a national level through a comprehensive, thoughtful and planned approach that blends multiple services across systems/ministries proved to be difficult. Intricate vertical structures within ministries and between national and sub-national levels,and poor collaboration among programmes in different sectors continued to pose challenges for implementing and monitoring integrated approaches, such as that adopted in ECD. For example, a multi-sectoral monitoring and evaluation framework and a clearly-defined coordination mechanism for ECD are still yet to be defined and put in place. This was intensified by the political turmoil that took place during October-December 2018.The fragile Sri Lankan economy was badly affected during the political upheaval with the steep loss in value in its currency, downgrading of its economy and loss in tourist revenue. In the wake of the political crisis and doubts about the future of democracy in the nation, several Governments and donors (such as Germany, Japan, the United States, and the European Union) froze their funding for development aid. From UNICEF Sri Lanka’s perspective, there were short-term set-backs, particularly the high-level advocacy events planned for November to December 2018, and the  delays in programme implementation at national and local levels impacted on achievement of planned results. Although the risks to UNICEF programmes and advocacy were minimal during the crisis since it was short lived, in the absence of an appropriation bill, a risk remains that the efforts to increase the ECD budget allocation may not be successful.  

In 2018, UNICEF continued to demonstrate different approaches to address systemic constraints that impede the realization of children’s rights, including piloting and experimentation, more intense upfront analysis, and working on an ‘at scale’ solution from the outset. 

One example relates to the potential of making an impact at provincial level. To facilitate the provision of safe drinking water to resettled communities in Jaffna district, UNICEF facilitated the promotion of three types of MAR options:  open wells and shafts, aquifer storage and recovery, and rooftop rainwater harvesting. This was because water was scarce in the region and the district lacked major surface water sources, as well as depleted groundwater due to salinity. During the field testing of these options with multiple stakeholders, UNICEF primarily provided technical inputs and resource persons from the same sub-national region, including for the development of training materials. The field-tested MAR options were well received at local government and provincial level, resulting in a recommendation to mainstream the MAR concept across the Northern Province. The Northern Provincial Department of Education integrated the MAR concept into their system, including the training of 12 education zonal teams and development of a video documentary (www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhdECItbInQ). The success of the tested options means that in future scale-up no additional field testing will be required and the MAR concept can be implemented directly. This demonstrated that the ability to adapt and respond to a local context, by creating local partnerships, leveraging local resources and knowledge and generating recognition, are important strategies for an eventual scale up of a model, and that expansion alone is not enough.

A second example is the child-centred approach to disaster risk reduction (CC-DRR). UNICEF partnered with the MoWCA to implement this innovative approach for an ‘at scale’ platform, using children’s clubs and child rights promotion officer (CRPO) networks. At the same time, opportunities were provided for learning and adjustments for further reach, through other players (e.g. international and national civil society organizations). While a pilot phase was considered, the project launch was very successful and eliminated the need for testing. A National Action Plan to rollout CC-DRR in Sri Lanka was finalized and will guide and coordinate all related activities by partners. In 2018, with UNICEF’s advocacy and technical and financial support on CC-DRR, the MoWCA included CC-DRR as a mandatory capacity building component for CRPOs in their annual development plan. It also allocated resources from its own budget as the first step to implementing CC-DRR in the country. In addition, through the promotion of CC-DRR in Sri Lanka, UNICEF was able to link key government entities at the grassroots level who had previously worked in isolation. The Disaster Management Centre and the CRPOs under the Department of Probation and Child Care Services commenced working together in identifying risks faced by children from natural disasters and planning for risk mitigation at district level through CC-DRR programmes supported by UNICEF. 

With significant progress made at policy and legislative level as a result of UNICEF’s evidence-based advocacy, commitments to greater accountability for implementation and follow-up is needed. There are many examples of policies being developed and adopted by the Cabinet, but not costed (and hence remain unfunded), nor evaluated to assess impact. Examples, include the National Evaluation Policy and the Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Action Plan. As such, UNICEF Sri Lanka will continue to strengthen national and local mechanisms, institutions and processes to monitor and report on the implementation of policies, and link these with international systems, including UN human rights mechanisms. 

Using child rights champions as an advocacy strategy was found to be particularly valuable for complex interventions that require sustained support. For example, the former Secretary of the MoWCA was a champion in Committee on the Rights of Children reporting. With her passion and leadership, consensus was built among stakeholders with diverse interests on collecting the much-needed data for the Committee report. Moreover, the former Secretary garnered organizational support for policy change for taking forward some of the recommendations.  

Similarly, a group of evaluation champions among Members of Parliament led to the momentum for passing of the National Evaluation Policy by the Cabinet of Ministers. However, voluntarily or politically-driven turnover of these champions resulted in losing commitment and a specific set of skills which can be detrimental to sustainability of a particular initiative. Therefore, going forward, UNICEF Sri Lanka will adopt a more institutionalized/systemic approach and focus efforts on building capacities and competencies at an institutional level.

Child participation is one of the Convention on the Rights of the Child guiding principles. Creating an environment in which child participation is fully and effectively realized has been challenging for the Government in Sri Lanka. Although successful initiatives and interventions have been put in place to ensure meaningful participation of children (such as child-centred disaster risk reduction, social cohesion and reconciliation), traditionally, the Sri Lankan society views children as the property of their parents or under the authority of elders within their community, with little recognition of any entitlement to their emerging autonomy.  

As such, child participation remains elusive for most children in Sri Lanka. The Government and, to a certain extent, the civil society have the tendency to address participation in rather limited ways – primarily through specific projects or one-off consultative events. Too often these initiatives, while achieving benefits for the individual children and local services involved, have made very limited progress in transforming the social, political and cultural environment towards greater opportunities for sustained engagement. UNICEF Sri Lanka remains committed to promoting meaningful participation of children within families, schools and the larger community. For example. children will be consulted on the choice of competing priorities for the allocation and use of resources and for the design of plans and policies affecting them. 

As funding streams are decreasing and the fiscal space is constrained, strengthening public-private partnerships and identifying innovative financing modalities are critical to ensure that the rights of children in Sri Lanka are protected. In 2018, UNICEF partnered with International Finance Corporation and 10 private sector companies from the garment industry, banks and others, to make the business case for employer-supported child care. UNICEF and the International Finance Corporation will continue to engage with other industries such as tourism and hospitality to expand this programme and ensure the provision of quality ECD services to children and other with childcare-related benefits to their employees, which can yield business benefits and be a win-win-win for employees, children and communities. 

Learning from its experience in 2018, UNICEF Sri Lanka will continue to implement the child-centred approach and test the theories of change as outlined in the country programme and Programme Strategy Notes. A stronger emphasis will be placed on middle childhood and adolescence outcomes, as well as on mainstreaming gender and disability in all outcomes. As change strategies, UNICEF will continue to use evidence for high-level advocacy and maintain high-impact partnerships. At the same time, UNICEF Sri Lanka will strengthen its communication for development and innovation.

La mise en œuvre du programme en 2018, année de fin de cycle de coopération permet de tirer les enseignements ci-dessous qui s’avèreront très utiles pour le nouveau programme 2019-2023.

La dispersion du programme actuel (dans 21 municipalités réparties dans sept départements) a conduit à une coordination et à des synergies non optimisées au sein de l’UNICEF et avec le Gouvernement et les différents partenaires. Ce constat a mis en évidence l’importance de réorienter les efforts en ciblant les disparités liées à la pauvreté multidimensionnelle des enfants. Il s’agira simultanément de renforcer l’intégration des interventions portées au niveau national et celles conduites au niveau local en vue de s’assurer de la traduction des politiques et budgets publics en résultats tangibles pour les enfants les plus marginalisés. 

En vue d’assurer la pérennité des modèles ayant fait leurs preuves en matière d’équité (prise en charge intégrée des maladies de l’enfant dans sa communauté, modèles d’intégration des enfants marginalisés dans le système éducatif institutionnel ou encore alternatives éducatives) promus par l’UNICEF, les efforts de plaidoyer politique devront être renforcés. Cela nécessite la mise au point d’une stratégie d’alliances avec le Gouvernement du Bénin, les agences de la famille des Nations Unies et, avec les partenaires internationaux. Dans cette optique, les interventions auprès du Ministère de l’Economie et des Finances sont déterminantes pour encourager le Bénin à davantage financer les programmes en faveur des enfants. 

L’utilisation systématique des données probantes pour informer le plaidoyer et favoriser une allocation équitable des ressources tout en optimisant l’efficience des dépenses publiques est plus que jamais indispensable. Le déploiement de cette stratégie a porté ses fruits notamment dans le secteur de la protection de l’enfant qui a bénéficié de l’allocation des ressources humaines et financières au bénéfice de structures pertinentes comme l’OCPM, les Comités de Protection Sociale. En outre, les évidences disponibles sur la situation des enfants ont été mises à profit pour l’engagement des leaders communautaires, des têtes couronnées et des jeunes comme acteurs principaux de changement social pour améliorer la demande de services de qualité, réclamer les droits et exiger des responsables qu’ils rendent des comptes. Toutefois, compte tenu des faiblesses du système national de collecte et d’analyse des données de routine indispensables pour le suivi de la protection des enfants, il reste urgent de déployer plus d’efforts pour renforcer les Ministères des Affaires Sociales et de la Justice et de l’Intérieur pour que le système soit fonctionnel. Cet investissement permettra de soutenir les résultats importants réalisés au cours de ce cycle dans le domaine de la protection de l’enfant du Ministère des Affaires Sociales et de la Justice et de l’Intérieur pour tenir compte des faiblesses de la disponibilité des données fiables.

De manière spécifique au programme Survie, l’insuffisance de synergies d’action dans la mise en œuvre des composantes santé, nutrition et Eau-Hygiène-Assainissement n’a pas permis de développer le modèle des interventions à base communautaire qui devrait servir pour le plaidoyer en vue de la mise à échelle. Cependant les réflexions pour une meilleure planification opérationnelle à travers une plateforme communautaire qui fédère l’ensemble des composantes a démarré et a abouti à un modèle dont la mise en œuvre sera lancée en 2019. 

Le modèle développé dans le cadre de la promotion des Pratiques Familiales Essentielles à travers la forte participation communautaire, l’accompagnement des élus locaux a montré que les changements sont possibles et le passage à l’échelle réalisable. L’expérience démontrée dans la commune de Sô-Ava a permis d’en apprendre davantage sur la valeur ajoutée de l’accompagnement des élus locaux. En effet, suite au transfert à l’équipe de la municipalité des compétences relatives à la communication en direction des mères pour susciter la demande des services de vaccination, les indicateurs de vaccination dans cette commune se sont considérablement améliorés. La connaissance du calendrier vaccinal est passée à 91% en 2018 contre 38% en 2015. Aussi la couverture vaccinale en Penta 3 s’est améliorée passant de 17% en 2015 à 69% en 2018. Cette appropriation de la municipalité a permis d’atteindre des objectifs non planifiés tels que l’amélioration de l’enregistrement des enfants à l’état civile. En effet, 3075 actes de naissance ont été distribués lors des activités de vaccination dans les 69 villages, ce qui a permis de porter le taux d’enregistrement des enfants à l’état civile de 64% en 2015 à 93% en 2018.

Enfin, des efforts supplémentaires restent à fournir pour la mise en œuvre d’une synergie effective dans la planification conjointe et la programmation des interventions dans les communes de convergence, notamment autour des thématiques transversales du genre et des adolescents.

Le travail de programmation conjointe dans le cadre du chapitre commun, des initiatives fédératrices ont permis une collaboration interagence ayant une synergie sur les résultats en faveurs des populations cibles respectives. Ainsi, dans le cadre du projet MUSKOKA, UNICEF a renforcé sa collaboration avec l’UNFPA, L’ONUFEMMES et l’OMS afin d’agir sur l’amélioration de la santé reproductive, maternelle, néonatale, infantile et des adolescents. UNICEF a travaillé avec l’UNFPA et le PNUD dans le cadre de la lutte contre les violences faites aux femmes en particulier le mariage des enfants. Avec ces mêmes agences, il travaille sur un projet commun concernant les personnes vivants avec un handicap. Enfin, UNICEF a travaillé conjointement avec le PNUD et l’UNFPA en vue du renforcement du système statistique national pour assurer la disponibilité des données désagrégées pour le suivi des ODD. Ces expériences de travail ensemble, seront capitalisées pour plus de résultats au cours de la mise en œuvre de l’UNDAF et du CPD 2019 – 2023.

Leveraging domestic resources for effective programme management
In the context of the increased need for domestic financing of programmes, effective management of available resources is vital. In 2018, UNICEF, in collaboration with other partners in the nutrition sector, successfully advocated with the Ministry of Health to incorporate malnutrition screening with routine seasonal malaria chemoprophylaxis (SMC) campaigns. This strategy reached 3,170,116 children 6-59 months old nationwide, and allowed identification of 29,356 children with moderate acute malnutrition and referral of 6,019 children with severe acute malnutrition for appropriate treatment. UNICEF provided technical and financial support for training of community health workers and health workers and contributed to the operational costs for supervision of active screening. Other partners co-funded costs for campaigns and supervisions. In 2018, the utilization of community health workers for distribution of vitamin A capsules to children in rural areas was introduced (instead of organizing large, costly mass campaigns). These strategies of mainstreaming new interventions into routine work of health personnel brought a substantial savings of US$1,678,000 to the Ministry of Health in 2018, and should be applied for the years to come. 

Sound, evidence-based emergency preparedness
The results of the National Nutrition Survey 2018 and the total number of children with severe acute malnutrition who were admitted for treatment proved that the scale of the nutrition crisis in Burkina Faso was not as large as expected. Advance preparation for the anticipated nutrition crisis, close monitoring of the situation and mobilizing emergency response funds were top priorities for UNICEF Burkina Faso. Thanks to UNICEF’s strengthened resource mobilization capacity linked to the Sahel nutrition crisis and increased domestic resource allocation by the Ministry of Health, the nationwide nutritional screening of children under age five years of age and supply requirements were fully funded in 2018. 

In the case of school closures associated with violent extremism, preparedness was carried out through combining the Safe School Initiative and peace education. Even so, all schools threatened in the Sahel region eventually closed. It is worth analyzing what the Safe School Initiative really changed in the context of prevailing insecurity.

Coordination in humanitarian assistance to internally displaced persons
Throughout the year, and especially during the last quarter of 2018, the number of internally displaced persons significantly increased due to ongoing insecurity in the northern and eastern parts of the country. As of the end 2018, more than 47,000 internally displaced persons were registered, mainly in the Sahel region. Despite the rapidly growing number of internally displaced persons, weak coordination within the humanitarian community and with the Government were barriers to grasping a clear and updated picture of the crisis and the needs of the affected population. Lack of clear definition of the 4Ws (who, what, where, when) among humanitarian actors, and little cross-sectoral coordination has affected a timely response to the internally displaced person crisis. UNICEF, other UN agencies  and a few NGOs provided humanitarian assistance starting in the last quarter of 2018. UNICEF, through a partnership with the Red Cross Burkina Faso and Danish Refugee Council, started implementing protection services for internally displaced persons, including preventive activities and psycho-social support to 6,000 internally displaced children (50 per cent girls)in the Nord and Sahel regions. The security crisis was a rapidly evolving situation and the number of internally displaced persons reached more than 54,000 at year end.  On 31 December 2018, the Government declared a ‘state of emergency’ in 6 of 13 regions. Based on the lessons learned in 2018, the humanitarian community strives to improve timeliness and quality of coordinated response based on humanitarian principles to meet the growing humanitarian needs. UNICEF, as the lead agency for nutrition, child protection, WASH and education, continues to play a crucial role in this national effort. 

Study camps to support students affected by school closure 
Many schools were closed due to repeated attacks or threats by violent extremist groups, depriving thousands of children of their right to education. In response, the Ministry of Education decided to organize ‘study camps’ during the summer vacation in Nord and Sahel regions, targeting primary and secondary students who could not attend school for the full school year but had to sit for end-of-section exams. This effort  aimed to establish camps in school compounds in safer cities (Djibo and Ouahigouya) to provide students with two months of intensive catch-up courses so that they could prepare to take the end-of-section exams. UNICEF played a leading role in coordinating this emergency operation, along with other partners, donors and NGOs. The operation was co-funded by UNICEF and the education sector-wide basket fund.  

A total of 4,983 children (2,239 girls) attended the study camps (90.1 per cent of those who received an invitation), demonstrating strong motivation of parents for their children to pursue their education. UNICEF supported provision of school kits, tents, mats and mosquito nets, and,  in collaboration with NGO partners and the World Food Programme, implemented holistic, gender-sensitive interventions in WASH and protection, health and nutrition to create a favourable environment for participating students. Inter-ministerial collaboration between the Ministries of Education and of Interior and support from local authorities were key to ensuring security for successful implementation of this innovative strategy. 

The success rate for the Primary Education Certificate among the students who attended the study camps in the Sahel region was 65.60 per cent, 1.43 points above the national rate and more than 5.0 points above the average for the region. In the Nord region, the success rate for participants in the study camps was 54.74 per cent, or 10.08 and 3.99 percentage points below the national and the regional rates, respectively. This may have been due to the longer period (by several months) of school closures compared to those in the Sahel region.Catch-up courses for two months might not have been sufficient. The cost for this operation was US$2.7 million (or US$550 per student), which is considered very high. Based on the after-action-review sessions with local actors and Ministry of Education, it was concluded that replicating a similar operation needs to be carefully examined, balancing the security risk and costs over the benefits. Given the substantial number of schools closed (nearly 100,000 students affected by the end of 2018), the Ministry of Education and the partners’ group led by UNICEF are  developing a National Education in Emergency Strategy to explore alternative, cost-effective, sustainable strategies. 

Water quality surveillance in rural areas 
With support from UNICEF in 2018, water quality tests on 200 handpumps carried out by the Government revealed a bacteriological contamination of water for half of them at the end of the rainy season. In an immediate mitigation action, all the contaminated water points were disinfected and tested again, and most of them were providing clean drinking water. Two water points in proximity to artisanal gold mining sites showed an elevated level of arsenic contamination and were closed immediately. In rural areas in Burkina Faso, water quality is tested only for newly drilled boreholes. The quality test results in 2018 suggest that contamination can become a problem in the years following the drilling, especially during the rainy season. Moving forward, UNICEF will engage with partners to advocate for a permanent, government-led water quality control system. In the Cascade region, the water directorate initiated a regional water quality surveillance system that includes the selection of high-risk water points in each municipality to be regularly tested and monitored; training of the provincial water quality focal points; and setting up of a dedicated regional team to compile data and generate regular water quality situation reports. This initiative might become an interesting model to feed into developing the national water quality surveillance system in 2019. 

Harnessing the power of business for building child-friendly municipalities 
Since 2017, UNICEF Burkina Faso has built a strategic tripartite partnership with municipal governments and the mining industry, taking advantage of the revised Mining Code (2017), which generates further opportunities to leverage funds from the mining industry to support the implementation of the Municipality Development Plans (MDPs). UNICEF continued to support the Government to pilot new methodologies to develop the MDPs using child rights and a gender lens. The plans in two municipalities will be validated in 2019. UNICEF conducted an analysis on the potential impact of the Mining Funds for Local Development (based on the revised Mining Code) with technical support from a young volunteer, to identify strategies to strengthen the capacity of municipalities to budget and absorb additional resources, based on results-based management. The results of the analysis were used during high-level advocacy meetings with the Prime Minister, the Minister of Territorial Administration and Decentralization, the Minister of Economics, Finance and Development, and the Minister of Mines to influence the prompt operationalization of the Mining Code., This positioned UNICEF as a key partner to technically support the municipal governments in this new financing landscape for local development. 

In 2017, UNICEF, in partnership with the Corporate Social ResponsibilityForum, spearheaded a workshop on child rights and business principles with the mining industry. This provided an excellent opportunity to encourage the mining companies to be more child-sensitive in their operations. In 2018, at least two mining companies requested UNICEF Burkina Faso’s technical advice on the integration of child rights in their corporate social responsibility strategies. UNICEF also developed a funding proposal to pilot the development of new Municipal Development Plans, using the Municipal Fund for Local Development, and including a package of child-friendly interventions in the municipalities where mining companies are operating. This pilot project will formulate a model of a public-private partnership geared toward child-sensitive municipalities. 

C4D as a strategy to fight persistent harmful social norms
Persistent negative social norms constituted a great bottleneck to achieving results in social and behavioural change. Communication for Development (C4D) interventions unveiled strong social barriers to demanding and accessing social services. Advocacy and negotiation at local and community levels, including the involvement of community leaders, are key strategies to engage and mobilize communities. In 2019, UNICEF will continue to scale-up C4D approaches with the aim of further addressing negative behaviours and social norms based on findings from a knowledge, attitudes and practice study and will perform an impact evaluation of C4D interventions in the Est region. UNICEF will continue to engage children and adolescents as change-makers and use the community radio networks for more dialogue to increase community engagement and participation.

Reflection on the theory of change (CPD 2018-2020)
The humanitarian crisis in the northeastern part of Burkina Faso intensified throughout 2018, with repeated attacks by violent extremist groups and increasing numbers of internally displaced persons. This constituted a major barrier to ensuring the access of children and women to quality social services, notably in education and health, but also in child protection and WASH services. The ongoing security crisis is significantly reducing the geographic access of humanitarian actors to reach the most affected populations. 

Burkina Faso is one of the pilot countries for the UN Sustaining Peace initiative. In this context, UNICEF is supporting the Burkinabè Government to advance the humanitarian-development nexus through its niche in fostering child rights in enhancing community resilience, particularly through community-based interventions in education, nutrition and WASH. These community-based approaches are gradually affected by the access constraints, especially in the Sahel, Nord and Est regions. UNICEF is exploring alternative strategies to ensure the community-level interventions in emergency-affected zones through involving community-based structures and organizations, religious leaders and inter-religious associations. 

The theory of change needs to be readjusted in terms of strategies, targets and resources. The radio-based education programme launched by UNICEF and the Ministry of Education in late 2018 is an excellent example of an innovative strategy that will allow students affected by school closures to continue their learning at home. A new focus on children on the move was incorporated in the country programme, expanding its scope to internally displaced persons, refugees and child migrants in transit. There is growing concern for children, adolescents or youth who are at risk of being recruited or associated with armed groups. UNICEF is strengthening its strategies to promote participation, capacity strengthening and formal/non-formal education of adolescents and youth to build their resilience and empower them to auto-protect from underlying risks. UNICEF Burkina Faso and the Ministry of Justice, together with the UN Office on Drugs and Crime and UNICEF-Niger, began a joint reflection to develop a juvenile justice model specifically targeting children and adolescents associated with armed groups. In 2019, the Government will increase its resource allocation to the security and defense sectors, which could have an impact on budget allocation to social sectors. In that context, UNICEF’s advocacy with decision makers on child-sensitive social budgeting becomes extremely relevant. 

The increased scale of the humanitarian crisis also has attracted donors’ interest in supporting the emergency responses. UNICEF Burkina Faso is fully funded for 2019 against the Country Programme Document’s Other Resources ceiling budget and will request an increased Other Resources ceiling for the Country Programme cycle as more donors commit to fund the programme, especially for education in emergency and social protection. The increased funding has operational implications and hasled UNICEF Burkina Faso to create several temporary posts to ensure delivery of quality results for children.

WCAR,Cabo Verde,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Dans le domaine de l’éducation

Ce qui a bien marché :
• Les concertations régulière avec les partenaires nationaux ont permis une meilleure entente et un plus grand engagement pour la mise en œuvre des activités prévues. Environ 90% des activités du plan de travail ont pu être menées à bien.
• Le dialogue permanent avec les partenaires nationaux qui a permis de dépasser un grand nombre de contraintes liées aux processus administratifs.
• La participation au Groupe Local de Partenaires de l’Éducation a constitué une plateforme de plaidoyer (pour le Préscolaire, l’Éducation Inclusive, etc.) et a permis une contribution effective aux options stratégiques pour le secteur éducatif. D’autre part, cette participation a permis de mettre en avant la complémentarité des différents partenaires internationaux du pays, de la société civile et du gouvernement.
• L’approche programme a facilité l’intégration multisectorielle et les synergies entre les portfolios thématiques. 

Ce qui n’a pas très bien fonctionné :
• Des procédures nationales assez lourdes pour la sélection de consultants nationaux ont impliqué la concentration de l’assistance technique durant le 4ème trimestre de l’année

Le secteur de l’éducation est en cours de réforme à la suite de l’entrée du pays dans un nouveau cycle politique marqué par l’alignement avec les nouveaux objectifs de développement, à l’horizon 2030. La réforme s’appuie aussi bien sur la planification stratégique, la révision de normatifs que sur la mise en œuvre d’innovations dans différents domaines (curriculum, gestion scolaire, suivi et évaluation). Pour la réussir il faut créer les conditions propices aux innovations notamment, le renforcement des capacités nationales et la mise à disposition de matériels et d’équipements. Par conséquent, l’appui technique et financier de l’UNICEF s’est centré sur ces deux volets, en contribuant d’une part, à la mise en œuvre des principales innovations en termes stratégique et de gestion et d’autre part, à l’égalité et l’équité dans l’accès à un enseignement et à un apprentissage de qualité 

En considérant que les processus de prise de décisions dans le secteur éducatif doivent être fondés sur des connaissances pertinentes de la réalité et que les compétences des enseignants constituent un élément essentiel de la qualité du service éducatif, le renforcement des capacités de l’enseignement supérieur cap-verdien dans la production de connaissances autochtones et de la formation des enseignants ainsi que d’autres professionnels de l’éducation, est essentiel. Par conséquent, même si ce n’est pas l’objectif habituel de l’UNICEF, l’enseignement supérieur devrait être envisagé dans le cadre d’une collaboration avec le ministère de l’Éducation, à partir de 2019

Enfin, dans le nouveau cadre de développement national et international (SDG’s), il est nécessaire de réfléchir au modèle actuel de fonctionnement de l’enseignement supérieur afin de de comprendre sa contribution aux priorités nationales. Ainsi, le renforcement des compétences essentielles du ministère de l’Éducation devrait englober, également, l’enseignement supérieur.

Dans le domaine de la protection de l’enfant

Ce qui a bien marché :
La relation de proximité (contacts fréquents) avec les partenaires a accru les attentes concernant les résultats obtenus.
• L’approche programmatique conjointe et continue (réunions de programme) a permis une plus grande interaction avec d’autres agences et une meilleure connaissance des domaines d’intégration possibles ;
• Les synergies et le travail collaboratif entre les institutions de l’état et avec les organisations de la société civile, ont permis d'optimiser certains résultats (par exemple, la célébration de la Journée mondiale de l'enfant en 2017 et 2018).
• Environ 90% des actions prévues dans le PTA de 2018 ont été réalisées.

Ce qui n'a pas très bien fonctionné : 
• Ressources insuffisantes pour répondre à toutes les priorités nationales ;

Dans le domaine de la protection sociale /Pauvreté de l’enfant

Les résultats satisfaisants obtenus en 2018 sont le résultat d’une collaboration étroite entre le gouvernement, les agences du Système des Nations qui interviennent dans le domaine de la protection sociale, notamment l'OIT, ainsi qu’avec la Banque mondiale. Au cours de l'exercice 2018, il y a eu une bonne coordination des interventions avec le gouvernement tant au niveau central que décentralisé. Des mécanismes de concertation permanente ont été adoptés, à savoir le groupe interministériel de protection sociale dont l'UNICEF fait partie. Celui-ci fonctionne comme un forum de débat, de plaidoyer et de conseil auprès du gouvernement. 

Il convient de noter que le partenariat entre l'UNICEFF, ILO et la Banque mondiale a également facilité le dialogue permanent ainsi que les interventions concertées et complémentaires entre ces trois entités. Ceci s’est reflété au travers d’un appui au gouvernement ayant contribué à l’atteinte de meilleurs résultats pour le pays. Une bonne visibilité a pu être donnée aux interventions de l'UNICEF dans le domaine de la protection sociale. Enfin les partenaires nationaux ont réitéré leur confiance en l’UNICEF et ont demande de continuer à bénéficier de son appui technique et financier.

Dans le domaine de la Santé de l’Enfant, de l’Adolescente de du VIH/SIDA :

Dans un pays dispersé comme Cabo Verde ou chaque île et chaque district compte ses particularités, la coordination multisectorielle et la promotion de complémentarités entre les secteurs sont fondamentales pour l’atteinte des objectifs et résultats dans les domaines tels que la Santé de l’Enfant, la santé de l’Adolescent et VIH/SIDA. Aussi, plusieurs acteurs sectoriels, publics et de la société civile se sont organisés afin d’identifier les défis à relever et se sont accordés à mettre en œuvre conjointement certaines interventions comme par exemple celles-liées au renforcement institutionnel, ou encore en matière de planification, de gestion, de suivi et d’évaluation. 

Compte tenu du profil de pays qualifiant Cabo verde de pays rente intermédiaire basse, les programmes de santé y compris ceux de santé de l’enfant, de santé de l’adolescents et du VIH/SIDA voient une réduction des budgets et des partenariats internationaux. Cela pourrait affecter la consolidation des gains.

WASH

WASH programme ownership by national partners increased with better involvement of the state services. In the Central African Republic’s context, this helped restore the presence of state actors who provide social services at decentralized level, and the sustainability of interventions. The approach will be maintained and systematized in 2019. Regular government field monitoring of activities, involving a technical monitoring group from the ministry in charge of planning, reinforced the national results’ monitoring mechanism. The community-approach is a factor of sustainability of interventions, and the community-led total sanitation will continue as the contribution to the UNICEF Global Game to end open defecation. 

Education
With the resurgence of violence and insecurity in many areas of the country, schools are systematically targeted for destruction as are temporary learning spaces. Many were burned down in 2018. During such events, UNICEF is often faced with the need to change partners during the implementation of an emergency project. In two instances, the country office faced the dilemma between working with a limited pool of national non-government organizations with weak capacity, or international non-government organizations that are prone to staff evacuation and interrupted assistance.  

To address the risks related to contracting national non-government organizations with limited technical and financial management capacity, UNICEF strengthened the quality-assurance approach and implementation of the harmonized approach to cash transfers framework. This is accompanied, when circumstances permit, by regular field and programme visits; coordination meetings; and UNICEF leadership in regional, sub-cluster groups of zonal offices, and academic inspectorate involvement in the monitoring and evaluation of interventions. In the prefectures of Ouaka and Haute Kotto, for example, where violence, looting and deadly attacks by armed groups led international non-government organizations to evacuate staff, national non-government organization partners such as ECAC, IDEAL and Espérance stayed and delivered, even in hard-to-reach areas, and contributed to achieve results of the PCAs and above all to key results for children’s learning. 

Health
Starting in 2015, UNICEF supported the implementation of integrated community case management in hard-to-reach areas in six prefectures, with the objective of ensuring the quality management of childhood diseases (malaria, diarrhoea, acute respiratory infections, malnutrition). Since the country did not have policy and strategic documents on integrated community case management, UNICEF has availed an international expert to support the Ministry of Health in developing tools and guidelines for the implementation of the project. Given the weak national capacity on integrated community case management, UNICEF signed agreements with non-government organizations (national and international) to support implementation of the activities. Implementation was delayed due to many factors, including the low Ministry of Health capacity to lead the process and insecurity, but 193 community sites (against 190 planned) were put in place after three years. 

This unique experience in CAR, though fraught with difficulties and setbacks, informs discussion on community-health approaches with key players such as the World Bank and the European Union.

Partnership management
The programme environment continues to show medium to high risk. The harmonised approach to cash transfers insurance activities involved risk related to financial management and internal control procedures among many national partners. An analysis of the partner portfolio revealed that the number of implementing partners is relatively high, which limits UNICEF CAR’s ability to carry out assurance activities as per the agreed plan. Starting in 2019, the country office plans to be more strategic in the choice of partners by strengthening the selection mechanisms with focus on comparative advantages, geographical positioning and the ability to deliver results for children. Third-party monitoring will be effective from February 2019 in hard-to-reach areas. 

Human resource management and staff well-being
UNICEF CAR prioritizes the development of staff capacity, ethical behaviour and diversity, building on efforts started in 2017. A performance management workshop, that promoted a ‘culture of feedback’ and a career development workshop were organized and appreciated, especially by national staff. The gender gap was reduced by three points, as the percentage of women in the office rose from 21 to 24 per cent. 

Staff well-being was a priority: discussions were on-going at timely and focused Joint Consultative Committee meetings; a two-day staff retreat resulted in a plan of action and an open-door policy by senior management. In a context where access to quality health care is a major concern, a webinar with the Division of Human Resources shed light on how staff can access medical services and clarified medical evacuation procedures. The country office had a staff counsellor on temporary appointment until November 2018 and reinforced its pool of peer support volunteers with two additional, newly-trained staff. 

Information, communication and development
The Central African Republic faces information, communication and development challenges, including issues with tele-communication; information, communication and development capacity; and the overall basic information, communication and development infrastructure. In 2018, the acquisition of new laptops improved staff mobility and performance. Productivity was enhanced by standardizing LAN-connectivity and implanting ‘universal Wi-Figuest’. To mitigate risk of fire in the Bangui office, a provider was contracted to renew the electrical system and install a central UPS system. 

With the UNICEF Regional Office support, digital health solutions was introduced and an e-health pilot project launched despite challenges including a lack of in-country optical fibre (thus reliability on the VSAT); power supply issues; limited competition; and low 3/4G Data Mobile connectivity coverage.

Security
The need to deliver assistance while ensuring staff security is a constant concern for the office. To strengthen security of UNICEF personnel during field missions, avoid unnecessary risk and better monitor staff movement, a new security procedure including personnel, equipment, vehicles, communication and movements was established. It integrates the programme criticality assessment results against the prevailing and projected residual risk in the specific mission area.

"
WCAR,Chad,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
The economic and financial crisis that affected the country has been the main constraint hindering implementation of the country programme of cooperation throughout 2018. Over the last few years Chad has experienced significant reductions in domestic revenue, which prevented the Government from delivering on its commitment to invest in priority programmes such as immunization, child health, HIV, education and implementation of the multisectoral nutrition action plan and DHS-MICS6 survey – which to date has been solely funded by UNICEF. Recurrent and prolonged strikes by public service personnel negatively affected programme performance and results for women and children, especially in the health and education sectors. 

Additional constraints include: the prevailing insecurity in neighbouring countries and in northern Chad; inequitable in-country distribution of human resources and relatively limited in-country presence of bilateral and multilateral development partners in an environment characterized by relatively low overall donor interest. The humanitarian response in Chad remained underfunded: UNICEF received only 44 per cent of the US$54 million HAC appeal required to implement a multisectoral response for children and women. 

In December 2018 two decrees were issued by the MEDP that may constrain the operating environment for international NGOs, depending on implementation modalities.

Communication for development (C4D) is an essential strategy that contributes to increased use of services and social behaviour change in areas such as education, child marriage, nutrition during the first 1,000 days of life and hygiene). However, it currently lacks an institutional home. With the exception of the MoPH, ministries and those dealing with media relations do not have a communication structure. This hampers the development of integrated strategic communication approaches that combine communication for social change, advocacy and community participation. 

Every child survives and thrives: Other than the systemic issues mentioned in the contextual analysis, the specific constraint with the strongest impact on the health sector in 2018 was the country’s financial difficulties, which led to delays in paying for vaccines and caused stock-outs of certain antigens during the year, particularly for vaccines purchased exclusively with government resources. Stock-outs ranged from 76 days for BCG to 34 days for measles and anti-tetanus vaccines. Low cold chain coverage, problems in vaccine flow management and limited implementation of outreach activities are only some of the additional barriers to strengthened routine immunization coverage.  

The Government of Chad’s policy of free healthcare for children under five and pregnant women has not been implemented effectively during the past two years, also due to financial constraints. The latter, combined with the public services strikes that persisted over several months led to a substantial decrease in health-seeking behaviour during 2018. Finally, the low availability of quality essential drugs due to the collapse of the national essential drug supply system, the weak organization and accountability of health personnel in stocks management (including ready-to-use therapeutic foods provided by MoPH partners) negatively impacted service provision.

Every child learns: Weak ownership of the education sector’s new interim education plan and its action plans by authorities at the central and subnational/local levels, as well as of their roles and responsibilities, had a direct impact on implementation and monitoring, and partly explains delays in achieving the results. This challenge should be resolved through dissemination of the strategy and development of subnational action plans covering the IEP period (to end 2020). Chad’s partners in education will fund the dissemination activities to representatives of decentralized authorities, union representatives, opinion leaders and parents’ representatives in the 23 provinces. This effort will also contribute to addressing the recommendations of the 2018 education sector review, and ensure that local education development plans are owned and aligned with the sector’s national strategy.

Every child lives in a safe and clean environment: Insufficient data quality (completeness, timeliness, processing, analysis and feedback) is a serious bottleneck to effective implementation. A single database is needed as a planning and monitoring tool for community-led total sanitation (CLTS), as well as to support data-driven decision-making to facilitate adjustments in implementation and prioritization of actions. UNICEF is committed to supporting the MEWF to develop a monitoring tool to assess the quality of CLTS implementation, measure ODF indicators and progress towards SDG 6.2. The absence of an overall sectoral review process results in lack of prioritization and duplication of efforts. In addition, the MEWF is not decentralized. At the provincial level it is represented by sector heads that do not always have the appropriate water and sanitation profile. As regards achievement of SDG 6.2, the sanitation sector is underfunded, and technical and financial partner interest in the sector is currently limited.

Every child is protected from violence and exploitation: The MWPECNS received just 0.7 per cent of the state budget in 2018, making it the lowest-funded ministry. The Government's contribution to the sector is reduced to funding the salaries of its civil servants. The sector is characterized by both fragmentation and centralization, with the majority of social workers based in N'Djamena and working in isolation in different services without a unified strategic vision. 

While regulatory and policy frameworks have gradually been put in place for specific issues such as child justice, harmful practices and birth registration, an overall guiding framework and vision, such as a national child protection policy, is lacking. 

In the fight against harmful practices, resistance to change by some traditional leaders is a factor slowing progress. The non-application of certain laws, combined with a frequent lack of consequences for perpetrators of violations, remain obstacles to the achievement of child protection results, particularly in child marriage. The current birth registration system is antiquated and administratively burdensome.

Lessons learned 

Despite the many challenges, the development context in Chad also presents opportunities for developing good practices and building on lessons learned to improve programme results.
The strategy of joint donor dialogue, coupled with capacity building of sectoral ministries in public finance management yielded results, with increased allocations to the social sectors, including health and education, in the PFL 2019. The results demonstrate the value-added of this approach, which will continue in 2019, in coordination with major partners supporting public finance reform, in particular the EU and World Bank.

Every child survives and thrives: The various community-based approaches in use present an opportunity to integrate high-impact interventions that need to be harmonized and scaled up. The community approach to promoting immunization, the child-friendly community initiative, with real time tracking of performance; the community-based approach to optimizing screening and treatment that integrates maternal, neonatal and child health into PMTCT; community-based interventions innutrition focusing on the first 1,000 days have all contributed to promoting utilization of antenatal care and assisted delivery, childhood immunization, utilization of mosquito nets, better child feeding practices and increased care-seeking behaviour. However, the fragmentation of these approaches has led to inefficiencies that need to be addressed to achieve a harmonized vision of community health that is owned by and based within the MoPH and its provincial delegations.

The survey of 21,818 youth and adolescents shows that the U-Report platform is an important communication and counselling tool for teenagers. It helped to understand young peoples’ need for an anonymous platform that allows them to interact with specialists in health, sexuality and HIV issues and to obtain answers without revealing their identity.

Every child learns: Building on the findings of the education expenditure tracking system study (UNESCO, 2017), which shows that a large portion of centrally released education funds for basic education does not reach schools, UNICEF Chad supported local-level interventions by building community capacity, promoting their independence through functional literacy and income-generation activities, and also by strengthening social dialogue and local monitoring of education results. This approach has yielded good results, such as girls’ return to school after childbirth, support for community teachers’ incentives, construction and maintenance of classrooms, etc., while also ensuring that maximum resources reach the beneficiaries. This aligns with the approach set out in the education programme component strategy note, which places priority on strengthening education supply and demand through community involvement. In Lac Province, where enrolment rates were lowest, the complementarity between community mobilization and strengthening of education services made it possible to respond to education constraints in a sustainable way. 

The use of innovative technologies for payment of teachers’ incentives and involvement of local authorities and parents in school management and monitoring was another good practice in 2018. Payment of incentives for community and contract teachers via mobile technology will be scaled-up by UNICEF in 2019, and has also been adopted by the World Bank. The use of mobile technology to develop a platform for decentralized authorities and parents in school management to support better monitoring at the local level will help bring services closer to beneficiaries and ensure real-time local decision-making and problem solving.

Every child lives in a safe and clean environment: The 2018 study conducted in Kanem province unsurprisingly demonstrates that recent episodes of diarrhoea, fever and pneumonia are strongly associated with malnutrition in children. The implementation of the ODF Chad roadmap is an opportunity to promote good handwashing and hygiene practices that directly prevent episodes of diarrhoea and mitigate their impact on malnutrition. However, the limited participation in the November 2018 launch of the ODF roadmap unfortunately demonstrated that sanitation is not a perceived priority, neither for the Government nor the donor community. It will be important to mobilize donors and the country around this SDG commitment through a communication plan and a donor round table. A financing strategy to mobilize resources for rural sanitation is planned for 2019. The office will advocate for integration of the CLTS strategy into the construction projects currently being negotiated with donors in the water sector. Specific coordination will be put in place to build leadership and ensure continued Government commitment to monitor implementation. 

The 2018 development of a national WASH strategy for schools revealed the need for clarification of roles and responsibilities across the ministries involved and within MNECP directorates. The strategy has strengthened understanding around the WinS environment. In 2019, the 23 provinces will finalize their action plans and start activities so that schools have the minimum package of services defined in the strategy. A strong link was established between the Chad ODF roadmap and the priority provinces for these interventions.

Every child is protected from violence and exploitation: The establishment of 145 community mechanisms, in support of decentralization of the child protection system demonstrated success in engaging and mobilizing communities for child protection and highlighted the need for greater involvement by traditional leaders in community mobilization, especially in the fight against harmful practices. This strategy, which will be pursued in 2019, complements efforts to develop a favourable legal environment against child marriage as one example of harmful traditional practices. 

The mobilization of technical and financial partners around civil registration in October 2018 had positive effects, but more advocacy is needed to mobilize technical and financial partners in support of this sub-sector. Adoption of a new national child protection policy, which UNICEF will support in 2019, should serve to reduce fragmentation in the system.

The youth and adolescent engagement strategy, developed in 2017 by the Ministry of Youth with UNICEF support, provided a clear intervention framework for supporting the mainstreaming of youth engagement within social sectors. The piloting of several projects by young people – through youth organizations and structures – demonstrated the expectations of young people and opportunities for transforming them into change-makers.

Cross-sectoral results: Reviews of joint UNDAF work plans underscored the importance of ensuring better engagement of national partners, as well as the need for more effective joint programming among United Nations agencies. In line with the Delivering as One approach, UNICEF will continue to: enhance collaboration within the resource mobilization group and the communication group, strengthen its engagement in the humanitarian advocacy group and undertake joint missions with partner agencies to increase the coherence of interventions by United Nations agencies.

Operations: Transaction times improved significantly with use of the VISION Hub, and this will continue in 2019. The shift to electronic funds transfer has been effective in meeting the needs of both partners and providers. Measures taken in 2018 for monitoring consultancy contracts had a positive effect, considerably reducing the number of open contracts with unspent balances at the end of the year.

UNICEF Chad will use the results of the 2018 annual review and MTR, under the UNDAF joint MTR, to take forward some of the lessons learned and integrate the revised strategies, with a focus on accelerating the achievement of key results for children. This will require significant strengthening of implementation of national commitments such as the vaccination roadmap, ODF roadmap, interim education plan and civil registration action plan, and support for the decentralization/de-concentration of service provision by enhancing the role of zonal offices, while diversifying strategic partnerships and the quality of the country programme resource base. Findings of ongoing major programmatic evaluations of the education and child protection components will help strengthen the achievements made to date and validate what should be brought to scale in future. They will also help to reorient strategies for overhauling the way systemic deficits are tackled, especially in the child protection sector.

In 2019 more focus will be placed on supporting the humanitarian/development continuum, so that local-level structural bottlenecks can be addressed sustainably. Equally, UNICEF Chad’s resource mobilization strategy will take into account the increasing focus on the continuity and sustainability of results, especially in host communities. New opportunities arising from the upcoming Chad-Arab World Forum planned for April 2019 in N’Djamena will also be seized. The forum is expected to attract US$1.5 billion in investment in private, public and public- private partnership projects over the next few years, with an expected increase in interest in the water and sanitation sector. 

Joint programming with other United Nations agencies in convergence provinces and leveraging of large donor investments in large structural programmes in other intervention provinces will also be sought.(World Bank for social protection, EU for inclusive and sustainable development),in the context of strengthening the humanitarian/development continuum.

Since 2019 will be an election year (with elections announced towards the end of the first semester), UNICEF Chad will need to revise its risk assessment and business continuity plans to mitigate potential impact on country programme implementation and delivery of results.

WCAR,Congo,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons learned in 2018 

Evidence-based advocacy is key to accelerate results for children
There is a need for systematic and consistent advocacy at various levels to influence duty bearers to take action for children’s rights. Therefore, there is a need to continue to strengthen UNICEF’s role as an advocate and convener for the rights of children. Some examples of advocacy related results are below:

Key Result for Children 1: Stride to accelerate immunization gains
In 2018, UNICEF supported a high-level joint mission of the Ministry of Health and Finance and GAVI senior officials to UNICEF Supply Division in Copenhagen, which raised the Government of Congo officials’ appreciation of the potential and cost savings, quality assurance and efficiency gains when procuring vaccines and health commodities through UNICEF Copenhagen. This created a partnership between Government of Congo and UNICEF Supply Division to agree on pre-financing mechanisms to procure vaccines through the Vaccine Independence Initiative, thus enabling Congo to cope with its financial difficulties and avoidstock-outs.

In this regard, the lesson learned was the need to guarantee availability of vaccines’ stock, and the Vaccine Independence Initiative proved a good mechanism to achieve this. In 2019, it is important to continue high-level advocacy to guarantee funding for the procurement of vaccines and related operational costs. Another lesson was that RSS GAVI support not only benefits immunization coverage but other high-impact interventions in the health system as well, such as maternal and newborn health. Going forward, UNICEF will continue to monitor the performance of routine immunisation and integrating high-impact interventions (EPI+). 

Key Result for Children 2: Placing nutrition high on Congo’s political and governmental agenda is key
A booklet entitled What Parliamentarians Can Do to Fight Malnutrition was launched and presented to a joint session of Parliament (the national assembly and senate) on World Children’s Day in November. This resulted with the President’s strong engagement of the National Assembly and the Parliamentary Association for nutrition and food security to rally behind children’s rights by making malnutrition history in Congo. UNICEF, World Food Program and Food and Agricultural Organisation, supported the Scaling-Up Nutrition movement to prepare and validate its roadmap for 2019-2020. 

Therefore, to accelerate stunting reduction, it is crucial to develop guidelines on key interventions. In the humanitarian settings, reinforcing the nexus humanitarian-development can better contribute in sustainable improvement of the nutritional status of children and women. It is  important to reinforce the convergence of UNICEF, World Food Program, World Health Organization and Food and Agricultural Organisation actions in the targeted areas based on the 1,000-day approach. UNICEF will continue to support the Ministry of Healthto scale up delivery of high impact nutrition interventions by developing national maternal nutrition guidelines, training manuals and communication materials and in scaling up of the baby-friendly hospital initiative.

Key Result for Children 4: improved learning outcomes require improved education management information systems
To evaluate quality of education in students, current assessments take place at the of the cycle (end of primary and lower secondary education). However, this approach not been able to obtain results by level of the cycle. For 2019, to judge the quality of learning in the cycle, fewer schools will be targeted and evaluated for all grades. To evaluate the quality of teachers, in 2018 the trainings on the practice of curative pedagogy were not evaluated making it difficult to make the connection between teacher training and students' academic achievement. For 2019, a test on the skill level of students and teachers will be done before the establishment of curative pedagogy in an institution to better monitor and evaluate school skills in key subjects.

Key Result for Children 8: Community mobilization is key to end open defecation
For 2019, the country office will continue to support community mobilisation to end open defecation and achieve “healthy village” status by strengthening monitoring, building a sustainable market for sanitation goods and services and through improving subnational coordination mechanisms.

Creating and earning fiscal space for children is critical to leave no child behind. The elaboration of the health budget brief is relatively a new technical area of work within PF4C for the country office. Challenges were faced in terms of data collection and analysis, for data related to budget execution. Advocacy will continue in 2019. At internal level, it contributed to increasing staff knowledge on budget issues that are linked to results of the health sector. In 2019, two budget briefs will be developed focusing on the health and education sectors. Based on lessons learned from 2018, the country office will partner with key stakeholders such as the ministerial counterparts, United Nations agencies, European Union, World Bank, International Monetary Fundand academia to enhance the quality of data and analyses with a view to institutionalize budget briefs. The country office will engage with Parliament by using budget briefs as evidence to inform policy dialogue towards protecting budget allocations for social sectors and making the budget more responsive to children’s needs.

Programme coordination and integration
Coordination and integration efforts supported by UNICEF have resulted in alignment of funding towards integrated programmes such as child survival and development, learning outcomes and child protection which are implemented under more than three government ministries and civil society organisations, and attracting resources from various donors. During 2018, results were evidenced in minimal duplication of interventions and complementarity of activities by partners. Improved coordination contributed to improved programmatic results that require inter-sectoral coordination, including improved provision of high impact interventions. 

The key lesson learned is that strong leadership and political will can be a catalyst for effective multisectoral coordination and integration. The complementary supportive policy framework including the national coordination framework, strategies and guidelines are critical for the coordination. Despite these efforts, intra-ministerial coordination and scaling up of integrated services should be further improved. It is anticipated that this will be further strengthened during 2019 and through the new Country Programme 2020-2024.

Emergency preparedness and response requires continued and coordinated support 
In the response to the situation in the Pool region, challenges remain including WASH, education and child protection funding gaps and a limited return of displaced civil servants (including education and health staff) to their localities, negatively affecting delivery of social services. 118 schools remain closed (with several of them damaged during the armed conflict) and therefore a total of 15,428 children (three to 17 years old) have no access to education. As the lead agency for the WASH, nutrition, education sectors and the child protection sub-sector in the Pool crisis, UNICEF Congo leads the process to expand sectoral groups, from local (Pool) to national level, to ensure humanitarian development nexus, synergies across sectors and strengthen government line Ministries capacities. Going forward, it will be important to strengthen local capacity to ensure sustainability of actions and services. UNICEF Congo will work closely with United Nations agencies and government entities to ensure that children and their families receive lifesaving commodities as well as to keep children in school.

Lessons learned 

UNICEF benefits from a trusted relationship with the Government, based on strong collaboration since the UNICEF Country Office was established in Cote d’Ivoire in 1986(including during the 2002 to 2012 civil war).. UNICEF is a resource in the country in child development and protection, especially in nutrition, education, WASH and child protection. In 2018, UNICEF reinforced its relationship with its line ministry, the Ministry of Planning and Development, notably through continuous technical support for revision of the National Development Plan Monitoring and Evaluation Framework and for the organization of joint field missions as part of the country programme document midterm review exercise. This positioned UNICEF Cote d’Ivoire as a strong technical partner, delivering results at the field level based on evidence. 

In 2018, with this privileged relationship, UNICEF moved forward a number of items on the Government agenda for the benefit of children and women. These included a stronger focus on primary health care; strengthening routine child protection data collection and management mechanisms; and the adoption of the multi-dimensional child poverty analysis (N-MODA). UNICEF engaged in the revision of the National Action Plan on Child Labour and Trafficking and released preliminary results of a report on the ‘talibé’ developed in collaboration with the NGO Interpeace. 

The country programme document theories of change were validated during the 2018 midterm review and the strategy notes were refined to reflect new data and emerging priorities and to better align with the Government’s priorities. The midterm review was an opportunity to reinforce collaboration with the Government and to refocus UNICEF Cote d’Ivoire’s interventions around the regional Key Results for Children. Internally, the Key Results for Children provided a tool to evaluate existing approaches, determine success or the potential to be scaled-up and to systematically brainstorm on how innovations could speed up the results. UNICEF Cote d’Ivoire developed a Key Results for Children monitoring tool to ensure trimestral follow-up of progress against goals during PCT and CMT meetings. 

In 2018, UNICEF Cote d’Ivoire introduced or scaled up several innovations. U-Report had more than 400,000 U-Reporters, placing Cote d’Ivoire as the second highest U-Report country in the world. Cote d’Ivoire’s youth engagement and participation projects were selected for the Young People Agenda book. Other innovations worth noting were the Intra-Uterine Balloon Tamponade (UBT) that saves the lives of mothers with postpartum hemorrhage; the use of mobile money for cash transfers; and a special operation for birth registration of almost 500,000 school children. A partnership with the social enterprise ConceptosPlasticos supported construction of classrooms with bricks made of recycle plastic waste. The ‘culture of innovation’ became a reality in 2018 and is a driving motivation force for UNICEF Cote d’Ivoire. 

As a follow-up to the 2018 midterm review and a consequence promoting innovations, UNICEF Cote d’Ivoire repositioned itself as a child rights and youth engagement advocate. Several ministries requested more support from UNICEF to tackle new challenges such as youth employability and the response to climate change.

In 2018, UNICEF Cote d’Ivoire doubled its resources. This was due to several factors, including the stability of the political and economic context and thus the trust of the international community and UNICEF’s position as the main organization for children rights. The technical expertise of the UNICEF Cote d’Ivoire staff supported the Government signing tripartite agreements for channelling World Bank, Global Fund, GAVI and French Cooperation grants through UNICEF, mainly in the areas of child survival and education. The Value for Money exercise was a new avenue in 2018 to attract new donors fromthe private sector and high net worth individuals. 

For the first time, the Country Programme Document 2017-2020 included specific objectives regarding the private sector. Developing effective relationships with the private sector is an investment that sometimes results in quick wins and sometimes requires a long-distance run. In 2018, efforts undertaken with the cocoa sector paid off. Partnerships with leading chocolate companies included high-level advocacy during key international events such as the European Union parliamentary hearing on child labour in cocoa and the World Cocoa Conference. UNICEF Cote d’Ivoire successfully advocated for a change in focus of the 2018-2020 National Action Plan on Child Labour, moving from a small project and response focus to linking more strategically into other sector plans and a focus on prevention.

Constraints 

In 2018 UNICEF Cote d’Ivoire innovatively found solutions to each problem that arose. The Innovation Specialist worked under the direct supervision of the Chief of Operations, and the Representative was engaged in introducing innovations, both of which helped support success. The operations team engaged with UNICEF Headquarters, notably Supply Division, the Innovation Global team and DFAM, to find a way to bring technical expertise from the Colombian social enterprise ConceptosPlasticos to Cote d’Ivoire. The visits to Cote d’Ivoire of the Supply Division Director, Headquarters Innovation team and the Regional Director were key to move the innovation agenda forward. UNICEF Cote d’Ivoire will continue to benefit from support from Headquarters and the UNICEF Regional Office to overcome administrative challenges. Additional expertise will be needed to face new demands such as the construction of school latrines with plastic bricks. 

In 2017, the Ministry of Justice requested UNICEF support for a Special Operation to provide birth certificates to school children who are registered in the school system without a birth certificate. Challenges arose with collaboration between the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Education and the Interior Ministry. The Ministry of Justice was not able to provide justification or results until late 2018, due to reasons including strikes and mismanagement. UNICEF Cote d’Ivoire thus carried a DCT over nine months in 2018. However, although the activity took more time than expected, the result to date of 492,404 schoolchildren provided with a birth certificate was still unprecedented in Cote d’Ivoire. The projected financial value of the Special Operation is estimated at US$2 per birth certificate, compared to the usual cost of US$50 for late registration. 

UNICEF Cote d’Ivoire’s limited budget for youth and adolescent programming poses challenges. However, UNICEF is well positioned in Cote d’Ivoire to scale-up promising interventions both for ‘connected’ young people and more marginalized and vulnerable youth. UNICEF’s partnership with Generation Unlimited offers a new advocacy opportunity to leverage funding or mobilize resources. 

In 2018, UNICEF Cote d’Ivoire had a staff of 105 (90 in Abidjan, 5 in Korhogo sub-office and 10 in Man sub-office). Seven national staff were promoted to international positions and 13 went on stretch assignments or surge missions. The recruitment of national staff with technical expertise in the areas of the harmonized approach to cash transfers, communication in general and  communication for development (C4D) was challenging, with several positions unsuccessfully re-advertised. 

Forward-looking 

In the final two years of the Country Programme Document 2017-2020, UNICEF Cote d’Ivoire programme implementation will be guided by the recently revised Thematic Strategy Notes. Those strategy notes and monitoring progress toward the regional Key Results for Children will be key in maintaining focus on interventions aligned with the UNICEF Strategic Plan and the Sustainable Development Goals. 

In developing the 2019-2020 Rolling Work Plan, UNICEF Cote d’Ivoire engaged in discussions with technical ministries to scale-up promising interventions, including the intra-Uterine Balloon Tamponade; the construction of classrooms, latrines and warehouses with recycled plastic bricks; the use of RapidPro and mobile money; the engagement of the private sector; and the extension of U-Report. UNICEF Cote d’Ivoire will intensify successful approaches and implement new ones to achieve Key Results for Children #1, #3 and #7. 

UNICEF Cote d’Ivoire will conduct at least two evaluations in 2019 as part of the revised Country Programme Document Costed Evaluation Plan. 

The finalization of investment cases (health, including GFF and immunization; adolescents, WASH and birth registration) and Value for Money exercise (WASH, education) will help leverage resources for existing gaps, notably in the areas of WASH and adolescents. 

In 2019, UNICEF Cote d’Ivoire will prepare for the next National Development Plan 2021-2025, UNDevelopment Assistance Fund and Country Programme Document. UNICEF committed to support the Government of Cote d’Ivoire in conducting the next Multi Indicator Cluster Survey. UNICEF Cote d’Ivoire also is pushing the United Nations system to undertake a Common Causes Analysis to feed into the Common Country Analysis. 

In 2019, UNICEF will conduct a Gender Programmatic Review and a Conflict Analysis. UNICEF also will build out existing sectoral data to develop the new Situation Analysis for Children and Women (SitAn) as a prelude to the next country programme document.

Lessons learned

Programming in fragile settings. In a fragile programme setting like the DRC, UNICEF drew on the ‘risk-informed programming’ approach to adapt programmes to rapidly meet the needs of populations affected by conflict and epidemics, while sustaining long-term development results. The re-assessment of the relevance, necessity, and feasibility of the different components of the UNICEF programme in the Equateur and Ituri provinces affected by the Ebola outbreak and inter-communal clashes respectively, informed re-prioritization of UNICEF resources (funds, staff and supplies) in these areas. The flexibility of donors to support re-programming of funds, and the agility of partners to uptake new roles were key lessons that facilitated implementation.

Technology-based solutions (programmatic). The pilot of a real-time monitoring approach using an SMS-based platform (RapidPro) and third-party monitoring was initiated in 2017 to improve field level oversight of programme implementation in the Kasai region. This contributed to improved quality of programme monitoring and accountability to affected populations in emergency settings. Based on the lessons learned from the pilot, the use of RapidPro was expanded in partnership with the Government, to the education sector to generate citizen’s feedback on the implementation of the school fee abolishment in the DRC. Reports will inform advocacy efforts in 2019.

Technology-based solutions (operations). Building on lessons learned from the Ebola outbreak response in the Equateur province, a more secure and efficient cash transfer modality was implemented in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. It used a mobile money platform with the aim to scale-up this innovative approach within the inter-agency business operations strategy (BOS) framework, one of the activities that had been identified in the 2018 BOS. UNICEF was selected to lead the BOS working group on cash transfers. The UNICEF DRC supply strategy was re-structured around four pillars (construction, procurement/contracting, logistics, and procurement services) to ensure timely delivery of essential commodities to populations in need. 

Decentralized programme monitoring. The monitoring of the effective coverage of the five key interventions for children (immunization, complementary feeding, birth registration, primary education, and access to safe water) initiated in 2017, was integrated into the programme review process at national and sub-national levels. This resulted in the availability of coverage level information on the five interventions in all 26 provinces, above the planned target of 10 provinces and informed work planning to address observe gaps in implementation.

Donor engagement. UNICEF DRC advanced the implementation of the Resource Mobilization Strategy (2017–2018) with a focus on key donors and engagement with innovative financing like the Pandemic Epidemic Fund from the World Bank and the private sector. This effort, together with the recruitment of a resource mobilization manager, resulted in the mobilization of US$118.4 million in Other Resources-Regular (103 per cent of the planned amount) and US$110.2 million in Other Resources-Emergency(43 per cent of planned amount).UNICEF initiated engagement with the mining sector to mobilize multi-year funding.  High quality reporting to donors was maintained, withproposals and reports strengthened through improved oversight and monitoring. UNICEF DRCsubmitted all 111 donor reports on time. 

Constraints

Three major constraints were experienced during the year. 

The delay in the finalization of the Strategic National Development Plan,constrained national investment in human development as well as reduced the opportunity to mobilize development funds. 

Limited humanitarian response funding in the phase of increasing population displacement due to conflicts and health epidemics (Ebola and cholera) remained a challenge. In 2018, the Humanitarian Response Plan of US$1.6 billion was 45 per cent funded. 

The limited humanitarian access due in part to insecurity in areas with active armed conflicts and the difficult geographic terrain in the country continued to be a significant constraint and barrier to reach many children and families in need.

"
WCAR,Equatorial Guinea,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
The two main lessons learned from programme implementation that ended in 2018 were the following: 

1) UNICEF Equatorial Guinea cannot rely solely on its limited human and financial resources to advocate for more equitable social transformation in Equatorial Guinea. The change has to come from the inside, and the catalytic inputs and factors will need a balanced and joint effort from the United Nations system, the regional fora, bilateral/multilateral partners and in particular the international private sector working in the oil/gas sectors;  

2) limited new data and evidence on child rights’ issues hampered advocacy efforts for government approval of equity and gender-based policies, and also legislation and the ability to leverage additional resources for children. There is a challenging context, where the country is not donor friendly and has a limited number of partners on the ground, particularly bilateral and multilateral donors and international non-government organisations.

Moreover, the state structure is more vertical, with limited inter-institutional cooperation and collaboration, resulting in ineffectiveness and inefficiency. For example, the country has one of the highest levels of expenditure in health (over US$700 per capita) but one of the worst under-five mortality rates in the world (in the last11 in the world).

The number of engaged civil society organizations in the country is limited and their institutional, human and financial capacity is restricted and somewhat thwarted by the specific socio-political context. Furthermore, there is no independent pro child rights’ platform that could raise the voice of children and contribute for a more holistic child rights’ agenda. 

The Government recognized, after several years of economic transformation and focus on infrastructure development, the need to implement a more equitable social agenda and a diversified economy in this constrained economic environment. UNICEF and partners take this as an opportunity to re-position their programmatic and strategic vision, as leading advocates, to put child rights at the centre of the national development agenda through policy advice, partnerships, public campaigns and positive social engagement and transformation.  

The development of the new programme 2019-2023 evolved against the backdrop of the preparation of the National Economic Development Conference (planned for 2019) to better align the current National Economic and Social Development Plan with the Sustainable Development Goal and African Union agendas.

In 2018, the main structural bottlenecks that impeded the realization of the rights of Equatorial Guinean children related to (1) the need to accelerate the approval and implementation of more equitable and child friendly policies (2) a low level of data and evidence-based culture that limits strategic planning and policy development, and (3) pronounced inefficiencies and inequities in the delivery of social services targeting children. All these factors were aggravated in 2018 by the economic downturn due to the country’s dependence on oil prices.

The development of evidence-based national policies and plans is hampered by the ineffectiveness of information management systems. The Government is working to improve the availability of reliable and timely routine information on social indicators (for example, availability of national statistics; strengthening the Health Information and Management System; updates of the annual education statistics).  

However, epidemiological and social data are not systematically collected and updated. A significant number of laws, policies, strategies and plans (family code, social protection legislation, a bill on customary marriage, a gender-based violence law, national health regulations, a national health development plan, national policies on child health and nutrition, and child health and malaria strategic plans) were prepared but have not yet been approved/ratified. 

In 2018 the Government submitted legislation related to child and gender rights (family code, regulatory law on criminal responsibility of minors, a bill on customary marriage, and a gender-based violence law) to the parliament and senate. Advocacy effort by partners involved in the social sector (United Nations, bilateral and multilateral, civil society organizations and the private sector) are needed to accelerate the approval of legislation and transform the social sector in Equatorial Guinea.  

UNICEF worked in 2018 with World Bank, UNFPA, international non-government organisationsand private sector companies to strengthen information systems by demanding accountability for the collection and delivery of data at local, regional and national levels. The 2018 decision by the Ministry of Economy, Plan and Finance to release the database of the 2015 population census was the result of the advocacy of all United Nations partners. The database will be explored in 2019 to gather data on the social sector, namely in health, education, WASH and child protection (birth registration). 

Despite a recent reduction of investment in infrastructure development (estimated at around 57 per cent of overall investment by World Bank in 2016), the financial investment in social sectors remained low as demonstrated by the Public Finance for Children study implemented by Government with UNICEF support in 2018.  

The average spending with a social character between 2006 and 2015 was estimated at 13 per cent with an upward trend (22 per cent in 2015). The study identified an average of sixper cent of budget allocation for the health and education sectors. This budget/financial constraint limitsdevelopment and capacity of service providers and the quality of long-term social services, including operation and maintenance. One example is the systematic loss of vaccines and medication due to poor management and maintenance of cold chain facilities. 

The level of investment in the social sectors (compared to the Gross National Product and the public budget) remained relatively moderate, to address the interrelation between social exclusion and poverty (estimated at 44 per cent in 2011). Nevertheless, public demand for social services is low and there is no culture to demand state accountability for services that promote general well-being. Community-based approaches intend to raise awareness amongst families of their rights to health care, education and social protection and promote accountability so that communities can demand better quality services. The ongoing process of institutionalization of a social protection system supported by UNICEF with special attention on children could play a critical role in protecting vulnerable and marginalized children and their families.

Lack of continuity of service and the absence of sufficient national capacity to service the social sector create important vulnerabilities. The Government guarantees the financing of a series of essential supplies from its own resources (for example, vaccines and anti-retroviral for HIV/AIDS treatment). However, there remain important challenges in terms of the timely release of funds, which leads to the depletion of stocks, disruption in the continuity of service and possible increase in morbidity and mortality. 

Informal fee payments for education and health services have negative consequences for children's access to such services. The Constitution states the importance of good health and free education. Education is compulsory at the primary level and current legislation and policies stipulate that a range of health services are free (vaccination, diagnosis and treatment of HIV and tuberculosis, delivery and post-natal care until 30 days, monitoring of child growth and development, diagnostic and treatment of malaria on Bioko island). However, in practice, caregivers must pay tuition fees for required materials. In the health sector, it is not uncommon that payments are required to access officially free services and medicines (for example, vaccines, malaria andantiretrovirals) or to pay higher amounts than official rates (such as delivery). This is often cited as an important barrier to service demand. 

A 2018 external review of health facilities implemented by Ministry of Health with UNICEF support revealed the following: 1) malaria is the main cause of morbidity and mortality of children and adults; 2) the health infrastructure has had substantial improvement but the rate of utilization is still below standards (less than 50 per cent of beds occupancy); 3) there are economic and cultural bottlenecks (vulnerable population rely on traditional medicine) impeding the full access and utilization of health facilities; 4) weak health information system; 5) inefficient management of the national medication system; 6) insufficient qualified human resources; 7) lack of basic equipment, supplies and materials to ensure a service of quality for all population; 8) deficient application of protocols and norms in primary health care, particularly for paediatric pathologies; 9) de-motivation of health personnel at local and national levels; weak financial capacity and limited autonomy of health services, particularly at provincial/direct level. 

Despite low levels of malnutrition, prevalence of stunting (26 per cent) is worrying and is related to low levels of exclusive breastfeeding (7 per cent) and high incidence of anaemia in children (67 per cent) and among women of reproductive age (44 per cent) in the population according to the available data from the Demographic and Health Survey 2011.  

Constraints in nutrition include: 1) limited institutional capacity, 2) no system for routine data on stunted or wasted children, 3) young child feeding practices are not sufficiently promoted, 4) nutrition is not included in education school curriculum, and 5) nutrition aspects are not prioritized by the Government, as there are no funds directed to deworming, oral rehydration saltsand Zinc+ provision. 

In the education sector, UNICEF Equatorial Guinea found that the child-friendly school approach, approved in 2015 and tested in 33 integrated preschools and primary schools, was partly successful but not ready for nationwide expansion. UNICEF implemented components: capacity building of teachers and school managers; provision of teaching and learning materials; and inclusiveness promotion through training and awareness raising. However, the components of school environment (WASH) and enhancing community participation through teachers and parent’s associations was not effectively done due to of a lack of resources and strategic gaps. The future plan is to implement all the child-friendly school components in the current target schools and to propose a gradual expansion to 200 schools by 2023. 

In the area of child protection, UNICEF collaborated with non-government organisations and civil society organizations on issues such as violence against children, children in conflict with the law and stigma and discrimination on HIV/AIDS, especially targeting adolescents. UNICEF Equatorial Guinea noted insufficient understanding and actions of government partners to address child protection issues, thus UNICEF focused resources on modernizing a birth registration system, generating evidence and promoting legislation on children in conflict with the law and proposing a protocol for child victims of violence and abuse. In the new country programme innovative tools will be used to reach a broader audience, to improve direct dialogue with the targeted population and to generate evidence on protection issues. 

UNICEF Equatorial Guinea started implementation of an integrated district approach with the goal of raising awareness on social issues and increasing demand from the communities. This programme started in 2018 in the Akurenam district with collaboration of the non-government organizations ASAMA and FRS. The bottleneck was the national centralization of finance management, which sustains poor capacities in the district for planning and implementation of interventions. To mitigate the situation, UNICEF started to advocate with the Prime Minister for a mechanism to decentralize the finance management at the district level as part of the sustainability plan for the child-friendly district strategy. 

UNICEF Equatorial Guinea 2019-2023 country programme will use its mandate’s comparative advantage to influence partners on policy support and programme implementation through two interrelated programme componentsto optimize the synergy between policy advice and fieldwork: child protection and equity, and child survival, development and learning. The child protection and equity programme will focus on policy, advocacy and system strengthening to address bottlenecks. The child survival, development and learning programme will advocate that all children, particularly those in under-served areas, have equitable access to quality health and education services, and will promote essential family practices through an integrated district approach. 

In line with the common chapter of the Strategic Plan 2018-2021 and other joint initiatives, UNICEF Equatorial Guinea will strengthen joint programming and partnerships with United Nations organizations such as UNDP, WHO, UNFPA, FAO, UNAIDS, UNESCO to address poverty; improve adolescent and maternal health; achieve gender equality and empower women and girls; and support availability and use of disaggregated data for sustainable development. UNICEF will leverage the resources of private sector and bilateral and multilateral partners (the European Union and the World Bank) for the social sector, and develop innovative partnerships to generate and promote data and knowledge on child rights with civil society, including national and regional academic institutions, media organizations and youth movements.

"
WCAR,Gabon,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Leçon 1 : Comment combiner les approches upstream et les interventions opérationnelles pour renforcer le plaidoyer et influencer les budgets publics dans un pays UMICS

Dans le contexte d’un pays à revenu intermédiaire de la tranche supérieure, le programme de coopération est généralement conçu pour travailler essentiellement au niveau des politiques, du plaidoyer, de la génération des évidences, du renforcement des capacités et du partenariat. Cette conception du rôle de l’UNICEF dans ce type de pays met moins d’emphase sur la provision des services aux populations, et limite les interventions de terrain à des modélisations pour influencer les politiques et les budgets des pays hôtes en faveur des enfants 

La taille limitée de l’allocation des ressources régulières de l’organisation à cette catégorie de pays (recommandation E/ICEF/2008/P/L.2) signale clairement qu’à moins de faire des efforts importants en matière de mobilisation des ressources additionnelles, ces bureaux pays ont moins de marge de manœuvre pour répondre aux besoins immédiats des populations et faire avancer leur agenda de plaidoyer. 

Au cours de cette première année de mise en œuvre du nouveau programme de coopération, les évidences issues du terrain et l’ampleur des besoins ressentis dans certains domaines prioritaires ont amené le programme à rééquilibrer ses stratégies d’intervention en mieux articulant les interventions upstream avec celles plus opérationnelles. En effet, ayant noté l’absence ou la déliquescence des infrastructures WASH dans l’un des plus grands centres hospitaliers du pays, le centre de transit des enfants en situation de négligence, maltraitance ou enfants victimes de la traite transfrontalière, ou même dans les prisons abritant des centaines d’enfants en conflit avec la loi, l’UNICEF et ses partenaires ont décidé de réorienter l’utilisation des ressources disponibles pour avoir un plus grand impact. 

Dans le cas particulier du centre hospitalier qui abrite en plus de salles de soins et d’internement, l’essentiel de tous les programmes de santé du pays (programme élargi de vaccination, programme malaria, programme tuberculose, programme lutte contre les maladies infectieuses, centre de traitement des PVVIH…), l’absence continue d’eau et d’assainissement depuis plus de trois ans compromettait durablement la qualité des services offerts. En effet, nul ne pouvait garantir la fiabilité des tests de tuberculose dont les clichés étaient lavés à partir d’une eau transportée dans de gallons à l’hygiène parfois douteuse. Il n’était pas rare de faire l’expérience de défécation à l’air libre faute de facilités adéquates au sein même de l’hôpital. Tous ces manquements risquaient de transformer le centre hospitalier en une source de circulation de virus, de pathologies ou d’infections néfastes pour les soignants, le personnel administratif, les malades et leurs familles ou de simples usagers. Face à cette situation, l’UNICEF et ses partenaires ont réorienté des ressources destinées aux interventions stratégiques (revue du cadre de gouvernance et de financement du secteur eau et assainissement) pour construire les installations WASH. 

Cette intervention dont le coût reste modeste garantit l’accès à l’eau et assainissement à plus de 250 résidents de l’hôpital de Nkembo et du CAPEDS. Outre ces bénéficiaires directs, on estime à plus de 30000 les usagers et populations avoisinantes ayant acquis un accès aux installations. En outre cet investissement couplé à ceux au profit du Centre d’Accueil et de Protection des Enfants en Difficulté Sociale (CAPEDS) et prochainement au sein de la prison, a contribué à positionner l’UNICEF comme un acteur majeur du secteur eau et assainissement au Gabon. A travers la reconnaissance du public et celle des autorités politiques, l’UNICEF s’est retrouvé plus que jamais dans une meilleure position pour mettre en en avant ses actions de plaidoyer en faveur des investissements publics dans l’eau et assainissement dans les institutions. S’il est possible d’envisager que le rapport de la consultation eût influencer les décideurs, il est moins certain qu’il eût des incidences aussi directes sur les conditions de vie de milliers de personnes que les deux forages et les installations associées. 

Pour arriver à ce résultat, le Bureau du Gabon qui ne dispose pas de programme WASH, ni de staff ayant un profil WASH a dû faire face à des contraintes majeures. Parmi celles-ci, l’élaboration des Termes de référence, le montage des dossiers d’appels d’offre et le contrôle technique des travaux ont nécessité une collaboration harmonieuse avec le Bureau Régional, les autres Bureaux de pays de la sous-région, notamment le Mali et la RDC qui ont fourni des appuis et des conseils très utiles pour identifier un consultant chevronné. 

Dans le domaine de l’éducation, des investissements modestes (moins de USD 8000) dans la mobilisation communautaire et des fournitures ont permis la scolarisation de plus de 500 enfants défavorisées dont ceux issus des populations autochtones. Au Gabon, le Gouvernement a mis en place un système de protection sociale qui offre des avantages sociaux et l’accès à la santé aux populations les plus défavorisées parmi lesquelles les Gabonais Économiquement Faibles (GEF) dont le niveau de revenu ne dépasse guère XAF CFA 80000 (soit USD 150) par mois. La citoyenneté gabonaise est une condition nécessaire pour bénéficier des transferts sociaux et de l’assurance maladie. Notant que les enfants apatrides et les populations autochtones en sont exclus, car ne disposant pas d’actes de naissance, corollaire à l’établissement de la pièce d’identité nationale, l’UNICEF a apporté un appui à l’établissement des jugements supplétifs à 6010 personnes qui plus tard leur permettra d’être enrôlés et affiliés à la Caisse Nationale d’Assurance Maladie et de Garantie Sociales (CNAMGS). Cette intervention ponctuelle (coût inférieur à USD 25000) a eu le mérite de créer un pont entre la protection de l’enfant (enregistrement des naissances) et la protection sociale. Mieux, elle a permis de déclencher toute une réflexion sur les réformes législatives nécessaires pour renforcer l’enregistrement de naissances. Ainsi à travers l’action de financer l’établissement de jugements supplétifs pour quelques milliers de personnes et favoriser leur accès à la protection sociale, l’UNICEF a tiré avantage de la mise en place d’une Sous-Commission des Droits de l’Enfant au niveau du Sénat pour engager un plaidoyer en faveur de l’allongement de la période de déclaration des naissances (3 jours actuellement) qui constitue pour le moment l’un des plus grands obstacles à l’enregistrement des naissances 

De ces expériences de rééquilibrage des stratégies « upstream » (en amont) et « downstream » (en aval) dans les pays à revenu intermédiaire de la tranche supérieure, on note la valeur ajoutée en termes d’impact sur les populations et sur l’agenda de plaidoyer que confère une utilisation stratégique et flexible de ressources financières limitées. 

Pour aller de l’avant
Dans les années à venir et compte tenu du coût élevé des modélisations des interventions à proposer aux Gouvernements, la difficulté de mobiliser des ressources additionnelles, la pertinence de la présence de l’UNICEF reposera davantage – sans négliger les missions « upstream » - dans des interventions ciblées à faible coût et à fort impact au profit des populations dont les conditions de vie ne reflètent pas nécessairement le niveau économique de leurs pays. 

Leçon 2 : Intégrer la préparation des plans de travail annuels dans le processus de développement d’un nouveau programme de coopération

Dans le cadre de la mise en œuvre du nouveau programme de coopération, on a noté un léger retard dans le démarrage des interventions. Ce retard résultait du pari pris de développer un plan de travail sur deux ans afin de traduire en plan d’actions opérationnelles sur une période relativement appropriée les différentes théories du changement développées lors de la préparation des notes stratégiques et du CPD. Le Bureau a pu faire signer dans les délais les plans de travail 2018-2019. Grâce aux activités de formation sur HACT et au recours à ses différentes modalités notamment les paiements directs et les remboursements, le programme est parvenu à mitiger les risques liés au démarrage tardif du programme. 

Pour aller de l’avant
L’analyse critique du processus de préparation des programmes pays a montré la nécessité d’intégrer le développement du plan de travail de la première année comme une activité majeure de l’exercice. Cela facilitera un démarrage rapide de tout nouveau programme. 





"
WCAR,Gambia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
During 2018 the country office reflected on the outputs from programme interventions to understand what worked, what did not work, and identify bottlenecks requiring adjustment given the window of opportunity provided by the new Government.  

Bottlenecks hindering achievement of results for children and women were: limited outreach at the regional, district and community levels; limited awareness by stakeholders and end-users; traditional and cultural beliefs and practices; high youth unemployment; and limited community engagement and participation. Despite prior commitments, ending open defecation by 2017 was not achieved, due to factors such as; limited funding (as UNICEF is the only partner supporting the Government), slow movement up the sanitation ladder to improved facilities (latrines constructed using temporary materials) and lack of technology options to address challenges faced by riverine and other vulnerable communities.

As part of measures to address these bottlenecks, UNICEF Gambia reviewed and reconstructed its approach to community engagement, resulting in the Ñsa Kenno initiative. Ñsa Kenno is significant because it mobilizes key actors to generate change and engage youth within communities (a key priority of the National Development Plan). Nsa Kenno will be leveraged as a great opportunity to intensify community engagement and involvement of key stakeholders in the campaign to end OD and achieve a national ODF declaration. As a result, UNICEF collaborated with the UNDP to re-engage with the local government structures, ensuring coherence (Delivering as One) and with shared responsibilities. The task of strengthening local accountability frameworks and linking them with relevant institutions was assigned to UNICEF; UNDP will address upstream governance mechanisms and ensuring alignment and coordination. 

UNICEF’s work in this area will aim to ensure that both demand creation in communities and behaviour change are channelled through local government structures, empowering agencies at these decentralized levels to engage and communicate with communities to drive change; while at the same time reinforcing existing local governance structures, which are mandated by law and policy to drive community engagement in development. This adjustment is a considerable step forward in overcoming some of the constraints identified, and brings UNICEF closer to its partners in Government and civil society and to the women and children it serves. In 2019 the office will be consolidating capacities and enhancing channels of communication to reinforce the engagement of children, youth and communities. Their engagement and participation will be essential to building a truly protective environment for every child in the Gambia. Also needed is sustained and coordinated advocacy with the rest of the UN system, development partners, the private sector and civil society organizations involved in children’s issues to secure positive outcomes and achieve key results for children (KRCs). 

KRC 1: Immunization-plus

During 2018, UNICEF Gambia continued its support to the Government on health system strengthening to improve immunization outcomes in line with KRC 1. Further collaboration is needed to ensure that the integration of services (such as immunization, Vitamin A and other screening services at service delivery level) is mirrored at all levels, particularly the national level, to improve planning and more effective use of resources. A national working group took initial steps to integrate Vitamin A and mebendazole into the vaccine supply chain to ensure the continuous availability of these supplies at the service delivery level. A key priority for UNICEF will be to continue to advocate and support the functioning and expansion of this working group to include stakeholders from other services, such as birth registration and HIV. The Nsa Kenno initiative, as a mechanism to strengthen multi-sectoral accountability, will guide all community engagement activities in 2019 seeking to generate demand for increased utilization of services and achieve high coverage. 

The findings and recommendations of the supply chain assessment conducted in 2018 will be implemented in 2019, as the country also continues implementation of the CCEOP to expand and improve cold chain capacity and performance at all levels, which will also aid in the integration of other services, such as Vitamin A supplementation. 

KRC 3: Equitable and sustainable access to education

Pre-school age education is a potential area for the Gambia to contribute to KRC 3. Through early child development parenting interventions, more parents have acquired awareness of the importance of pre-school education. UNICEF also provided learning and play materials to 60 pre-schools and training for ECD facilitators and caregivers. These interventions removed cost barriers for parents and enhanced facilitators’ capacity to deliver quality interactions and learning experiences. Adopting a cross-sectoral approach to ECD will ensure holistic development of children and maximize their school-readiness in 2019 and beyond. 

In 2018 UNICEF interventions sought to ensure that all children, especially the marginalized and vulnerable, have access to education — from pre-school to secondary school. This raised the need to rethink and create innovative ways of getting more children into school, e.g., children with disabilities. These children are generally either not in school or drop out because schools do not meet their unique needs. UNICEF supported the training of 15 itinerant teachers who provided regular pedagogical support to children with disabilities in mainstream classrooms. The provision of motorbikes to itinerant teachers facilitated their monitoring and support to the children. In addition, the provision of WASH facilities in schools facilitated access to safe water and basic sanitation facilities for children in school, which helped to create conducive learning environments.

Secondary education completion by girls increased as a result of community engagement and making schools safe and conducive for girls. Forty low-enrolment communities were engaged through sensitization on the importance of education and the social and individual benefits of girls completing secondary education. This engagement will be intensified using the Ñsa Kenno in 2019. 

KRC 5: Violence against children

UNICEF Gambia reviewed the constraints and lessons learnt regarding provision of a more protective environment for children in 2018. A robust child protection system in the country and community level child protection interventions (notably to address child marriage, female genital mutilation/cutting, and children on the move) is essential to preventing violence against children. 

This involves strengthening community-based child protection mechanisms and linking them with regional and national mechanisms. This has been initiated and UNICEF will continue to strengthen the system and work closely with the new Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare. One key priority for 2019 is to identify measures to increase the number of social workers within the ministry. This is imperative, as currently the ratio of social workers to children is 1:30,000. UNICEF will link KRCs 3 and 5 through an implementation roadmap in 2019 for addressing all forms of violence against children.

A significant opportunity is the commitment by the Government to set up a dedicated and functional social protection secretariat, which will be situated in the new Ministry for Women, Children and Social Welfare in 2019. This will provide a focal point for investment and capacity building and build synergies between UNICEF’s support to work in child protection, social protection and other areas of intervention. 

Following the advent of the new administration, UNICEF built a cordial relationship with the National Assembly. This relationship presents an opportunity to strengthen the Assembly’s mandate and ensure that children’s issues are on the agenda of the Select Committee on Women, Children and Refugees and other committees. Furthermore, this will ensure that line Government ministries, agencies and departments of are held accountable as duty-bearers in upholding the rights of children. The National Assembly budget planning and review meeting in 2019 represents a unique opportunity for UNICEF to speak out for children and drive government investment and accountability. 

In the approved budgets of 2017 and 2018, funding for key social sectors such as education and health received marginal increases, which did not translate to an increase in the allocation of resources to key government programmes and budget lines aimed at improving the wellbeing of children. In 2019 and beyond, UNICEF’s work on public financing for children will focus on advocating for increased government allocations to child-focused line ministries. Similarly, attention will be paid to the strategic social programmes that affect children and specific budget lines (such as pharmaceuticals and vaccines), rather than taking a sector-wide approach as in the past. 

The Government is still characterized by high turnover among senior staff, including ministers and permanent secretaries, which represents a threat to closing rights gaps of children in the country. This continues to threaten Government coordination mechanisms and leadership for ensuring synchronization within sectors. The absence of a mechanism to coordinate implementation of the UNDAF is one of the factors responsible for weak coordination among the sectors. Discussions are ongoing to ensure that this is addressed in 2019. UNICEF, by taking on some broader coordination efforts, will continue to support the Government as a convener of some sectors to ensure relevance and coherence of this mechanism to achieve better results for children. 

The continued short-term funding received for visibility remains a significant challenge, especially when the majority of other resources (OR) funds are limited to a 12-month duration. The office will work with the region to attract multi-year OR funding to facilitate long- term visibility. Also, the establishment of long-term agreements with service providers will reduce duplication of visibility material produced, enhance coordination and provide value for money when there is funding from multiple donors for similar programmes. 

A key lesson learnt from engaging with the private sector in 2018 was that private sector stakeholders do not understand how they can deliver results for children through their marketplace. The office engaged them in 2018 and will continue to work with Gambia Chamber of Commerce and Industry in 2019 to provide knowledge and co-create solutions and products for children with the private sector. Through the sanitation marketing approach, the private sector will be engaged further to develop affordable sanitation products and services aimed at providing durable and sustainable sanitation solutions, facilitating the move to higher level of the sanitation ladder through improved and non-shared facilities).

The Country Office faced some challenges in the use of innovative technology for development to improve implementation of its interventions. In 2018, UNICEF Gambia initiated set-up of the U-Report with two network providers; the launch is scheduled for March 2019 at the African youth conference on African unity and development. The office will continue to consolidate 2018 efforts and explore new and innovative technology to help deliver better results for children. 

The delivery of successful programmes is reliant on effective operational support within the  office. In 2018, UNICEF Gambia improved its operational efficiency and effectiveness by, for example, launching long-term agreements as a key process for contracting on behalf of the operation management team (OMT), and consolidated guidance and capacity building for UNICEF staff and partners on managing UNICEF's financial support. It also continued to support increased efficiency within the UN country team in 2018, through active engagement by UNICEF operations staff on the operations management team.

Staff professional development was a key priority in 2018, to ensure that staff implementing programmes and operations have the required knowledge and skills to perform their tasks. During the year, management and staff worked together to identify ways to improve staff learning opportunities, resulting in the finalization of a staff human resource development strategy. 

Standardization of practices through the development of standard operating procedures ensured implementation of programmes in line with UNICEF’s global rules and policies. These procedures were essential to maximizing efficiency and effectiveness, especially in a growing office with a new programme cycle and high staff turnover. UNICEF was also instrumental in supporting the Gambia’s efforts to end open defecation through technical support (facilitating the development of a national community-led total sanitation (CLTS) database and roadmap to end open defecation), financial support (funding most CLTS interventions in the country) and, most importantly, building the capacity of MoHSW staff through training, sharing manuals and relevant literature, mentoring and informal on-the-job discussions.

"
WCAR,Ghana,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
The year 2018 was the first year of implementation of the 2018-2022 UNICEF Ghana Country Programme. Despite constraints to implementation, new opportunities and emerging programmatic areas of interest, revision of the theory of change for the country programme remained relevant. Nevertheless, there were notable observations in 2018 pertaining to the evolving programme environment, which may have implications for how UNICEF Ghana carries its work forward in 2019. 

On 20th November 2019, the United Nations will celebrate the 30th anniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child by the United Nations General Assembly. Ghana was the first country to sign and ratify the Convention, and UNICEF Ghana will make the celebration of the 30th anniversary central to its advocacy.  

The results of MICS 6 (2017/18) and other survey data suggest that progress for children and young people slowed since 2011. UNICEF will mobilize all stakeholders around key issues such as intensified poverty and disparities, low child nutrition, poor sanitation and unsafe environments, poor foundational literacy and numeracy attainment, and low transition to high school. While complementary analysis of the data is necessary, UNICEF Ghana will seek to leverage the 30th anniversary of the Convention as a key moment for reassessing and redirecting political and economic will towards results for children and young people, particularly in areas highlighted by MICS 6. 

The President promoted a ‘Ghana Beyond Aid’ agenda for Ghana to eventually cover its development needs independently. While demand for public resources across different sectors of the economy limits the fiscal space for social programmes, some development partners have re-examined their development portfolios and are preparing to shift from aid to trade, or to scale down their support, further constraining resources available for programmes for children. For this reason, UNICEF will explore the potential to both generate and leverage existing, new and varied sources of funding, while establishing a partnership and resource mobilisation function to ensure that adequate time and resources are employed in cultivating and sustaining donor partnerships.  

UNICEF Ghana will advance its engagement with the business sector in shared-value partnerships, and expand the scope and content of its overall partnership focus with business to positively influence markets and value chains impacting key and emerging social issues affecting children. The launch of the basic sanitation fund in 2018, a partnership between UNICEF, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, regional banks and national authorities, is a notable example of this shift in partnership focus.

The transition to the new country programme, with its focus on outcomes and innovation, raises the need for UNICEF to be more flexible and adaptive to take on new challenges. In December 2018, UNICEF Ghana launched the Basic Sanitation Fund, a revolving finance scheme offering loans to households that have access to funds but struggle to save the capital investment required for a toilet. The situation is familiar to many urban slum households that are required to pay for public toilets (typically between US$ 50 to US$ 150 per year). Interest rates for microfinance loans generally exceeded 50 per cent per annum, which is unaffordable for most households.  

The Basic Sanitation Fund, which provides affordable financing for both households and artisans, operates through rural community banks under the coordination of the regulatory Apex Bank, providing loans at a 12 per cent interest rate. Capital for the rural banks is provided by UNICEF through the Apex Bank; the scheme is funded by the donor. The approach required that UNICEF Ghana loan donor money to banks, which is a new modality of engagement for UNICEF. Because the initiative generated legal, administrative and accountability challenges, it took approximately one year to negotiate these challenges before operationalizing the initiative, with additional issues arising in a sequential process. 

Support from UNICEF headquarters WASH section advanced the initiative. Eventually, high-level recognition for the project by the UNICEF innovative finance advisory group accelerated progress and intensified internal engagement and support from Division of Financial and Administrative Management and the UNICEF legal office, which assisted in the identification and resolution of key challenges, enabling the initiative to start in late 2018. Within two weeks of the launch, loans amounting to over 40 per cent of the total available pool had been approved by the rural banks, demonstrating high demand for the innovative financing approach.  

The key observation from the experience is the need to identify internal mechanisms that can quickly highlight and support innovation emerging from UNICEF that is likely to add value to children’s lives but which may be complex to advance under the existing legal, administrative and financial guidelines and policies of the organisation. This would involve identifying key constraints early in the development process and establishing a mechanism to bring key cross-sectoral competencies from headquartersand country offices together to advance development. 

Results-based financing works under certain conditions. Operational research undertaken in 2017 identified that most of the results reported in a UNICEF-supported government rural sanitation programme came from a limited number of districts. The research identified that a factor in achievement was the support from district political leadership. However, budget tracking showed that most districts in the rural sanitation programme made limited or no contributions from their own funds to achievesanitation results. From the evidence, UNICEF concluded that results-based funding could be a mechanism to reward strongly performing districts, andencourageleadership in lower-performing districts to increase focus on sanitation results.  

Under results-based funding, to continue receiving funding, districts involved in community-led total sanitation implementation were required to have a minimum of 80 per cent of targeted and funded communities certified as open-defecation free. Districts achieving between 50 per cent and 80 per cent success were provided with limited additional funds, together with technical support to increase their capacity to deliver results. Districts achieving under 50 per cent success were provided only with capacity building support. Districts receiving funds were required to commit district funds to the sanitation programme.  

During the assessment, one in two districts that did not meet the qualifying benchmarks for further investment committed their own resources to achievethe targets, and subsequently re-qualified for funding. The results suggest a potential to leverage results-based funding approaches across other sectors. Going forward, where appropriate UNICEF incorporate results-based funding into district funds that are directed for children.

Linking social protection with social services to maximize impact for children 
In 2008, the Government of Ghana launched the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty, which provides cash transfers to very poor and vulnerable households. In 2015, UNICEF with support from USAID partnered with the Government to launch a pilot, Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty 1000, expanding benefits to households with women who are pregnant and children under one year old. The additional category was eventually mainstreamed into the larger Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty Programme. As of December 2018, the Programme reached more than 203,000 poor families in all pre-existing 216 districts of Ghana. 

UNICEF commissioned an impact evaluation study of Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty 1000 households, which was conducted by the UNICEF Office of Research, the Institute for Statistical, Social and Economic Research at the University of Ghana,the University of North Carolina and Navrongo Health Research Centre. Overall, the evaluation found that the programme impacted child and household well-being. Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty 1000 households were better able to maintain baseline levels of dietary diversity, eating more cereals, dairy, eggs, vegetables, oils/fats, and spices than comparison households. Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty demonstrated a protective effect for beneficiary households. For example, while poverty increased and household expenditures decreased in both treatment and control households over time, the Livelihood households experienced less of a decline than comparison households. The evaluation showed positive impacts on access to services, such as increased access to the national health insurance scheme, and social and economic impacts, including women’s increased participation in social networks and empowering household investment in productive activities. 

The evaluation did not find an impact on one programme objective, namely the reduction of child nutrition and stunting. While there were contributing factors for this, the findings prompted reflection about the pilot programme assumptions. Several cash transfer programme evaluations in Africa also found minimal or no impact on stunting or on final health outcomes for children. The findings indicate that aschild nutrition and stunting are determined by a complex set of factors such as sanitation, quality of health services and feeding practices, cash transfers alone can have positive impacts on some determinants but are unlikely have an impact on overall stunting.  

In combination with global evidence, the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty 1000 households evaluation suggested that while cash and health insurance are important components to improvechild welfare, strengthening linkages with health and social services are required to make an impact on overall nutrition. Reflecting this lesson, starting in 2018, UNICEF Ghana placed emphasis on building an integrated approach to social protection and social welfare and health services.  

During the 2018 annual management review, UNICEF Ghana discussed the lessons learned and recommendations and incorporated related actions into the annual management plan for 2019. The county office will monitor its progress in implementing those actions in various fora, including at monthly country management team and programme management team meetings.

UNICEF seized on key opportunities to enable the programmatic environment, using its strong, credible and trusted voice in the country to leverage transformative changes. To accelerate key results for children, UNICEF Guinea made the strategic choice to first provide ‘concept proof evidence’ through modelling the commune of convergence approach piloted by the National Programme of Communes of Convergence.

UNICEF Guinea’s approach to local planning, local council empowerment, local coordination/child focus integration has resulted in community adherence and ownership and  good field results. But this strategic programmatic shift was still a learning curve and it required that additional technical support be provided to the government ministries and regional institutions. The first half of 2018 focused on the realignment of UNICEF interventions to the newly adopted decentralization law. 

UNICEF realignment to local planning processes (PDL and PAI) that fully integrate now the key resumption working toward quality and sustainability is a window of opportunity to provide additional evidence of success, a positive narrative for fulfilling children at scale at the national level. To fully achieve key results for children, UNICEF Guinea is learning to better position itself in leveraging resources. In spite of low domestic resource commitment; most subventions allocated to Guinea are rarely fully used; the utilization rates are below 50 per cent with much delays on implementation; the weak financial, reporting and accountability system is a major bottleneck to achieving child rights in Guinea.

Improving the country financial accountability system goes beyond the HACT capacities; the country overall macro assessment reveals systemic poor governance. UNICEF is well positioned in the country. High level advocacy, collaborating and partnering with the good brokers and doors keepers are wining strategies for UNICEF. Guinea remained a fragile post-Ebola country with a diverse range of risks. The country has experienced a sharp decline in external resources and recovery efforts continue in a difficult context. Most of the challenges to UNICEF’s work relate to the enabling environment. This underpins the Country Programme Document’s top priority of system strengthening. 

UNICEF Guinea has not benefited from UNICEF's Humanitarian Action (HAC) funding since 2016. Efforts to ensure minimum preparedness and rapid response continue to be challenged by a weak humanitarian emergency preparedness system. The lack of national leadership in the management and coordination of humanitarian action is acute. With the end of the Ebola response, some strategic humanitarian partners departed. 

Mechanisms for a minimum preparedness and a rapid response to humanitarian action must be strengthened. Those mechanisms should be based on community-based monitoring and early warning, and strongly interact with the effective involvement of grassroots stakeholders (local elected officials and community leaders).  

Proven strategies to accelerate birth registration, increase the number of open defecation free communities and increase routine immunization include working directly with targeted communities to build grassroots coalitions and alliances at the community level around a common agenda such as the six Key Results for Children.

UNICEF successfully worked closely with the Government to advocate to advance national policies such as the national community health policy that committed local councils and decentralized technical services to work together in providing a holistic package to communities.

WCAR,Guinea Bissau,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
In 2018, UNICEF Guinea-Bissau conducted the Mid-Term Review of its Country Programme 2016-2020, which entailed extensive consultations with Government counterparts, CSOs, NGOs and children. It was an opportunity to conduct an in-depth analysis of the current situation given the continuous political and institutional instability in the country, assess progress against results, identify and discuss lessons learnt and make appropriate adjustments.

One of the main constraints analysed during the MTR was the lack of an effective data management system in Guinea-Bissau. In line with the country’s overall fragility, the national statistical system is unable to generate quality and up-to-date data to support public policymaking. The institutional framework for statistical production lacks clear normative and procedural instruments. The National Institute of Statistics is under-staffed and lacks technical, material, financial and human resources. In addition, its authority is not clearly established, and its legal status needs to be enforced. As a result, data collection and dissemination are not properly coordinated. A decree on the National Statistical Council was drafted and adopted by the Council of Ministers in 2017, but it is yet to be promulgated. In 2018, a new National Statistics Strategy was developed for 2018-2020 and is pending adoption. Ownership by national stakeholders and support of development partners will be required to ensure its operationalization. 

At sector level, information systems lack capacity to produce and disseminate routine data. 

In health and nutrition, a health yearbook has not been published for many years. There is multiple data collection by the various programmes. Each one tends to use different tools. The National Health Institute, INASA, which manages the health information system is separate from the Ministry, which creates additional challenges in the communication flow. The INASA does not have the sufficient capacity to assume this role. The accuracy of data available has been often questioned by users. The population denominator used by INASA is problematic as it seems to under-estimate the real population figure.

In education, statistics have been recently completed for the academic year 2014-2015 after eight years of interruption. Despite support provided by UNICEF and UNESCO, education statistics for the period 2016 to 2018 are not available. The Ministry has a department which is responsible for producing statistics but it lacks adequate skills as well as financial and material resources. The capacity for data collection is also weak at the sub-national levels. This lack of data results in lack of knowledge on the status of key indicators such as pupilto teacher ratios, net enrolment, repetition and drop-out rates. 

In both the health and education sectors, planning and budgeting are not based on actual data but on estimates, which potentially results in under or overestimating the requirements. 

In water, sanitation and hygiene there is a wide range of raw data available, but there is insufficient capacity to maintain, update and analyse this data. In addition, the fact that the Ministry of Natural Resources does not have decentralized services in most regions creates a major bottleneck for data collection. 

In child protection, the Women and Child Institute, together with partner NGOs, collects national data on cases of violence, exploitation and abuse of children twice a year with UNICEF support, but there is no systematic data analysis and dissemination. UNICEF needs to continue to invest in data collection and capacity building of partners to ensure a functional information system.

With regards to indicators related to SDGs and children, the country relies mainly on the MICS, supported by UNICEF, which produces social statistics every four years. There are no other national household surveys conducted in the country in a regular manner. 

This overall barrier of efficient data collection and analysis challenges the country to effectively monitor progress towards the SDGs. The final document of the Agenda 2030 stresses the importance of statistics and the need for ""high quality data, timely and viable, and disaggregated by income, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status, physical disability and geographical location"", which, for Guinea-Bissau, has been a major challenge.

Within this context, a data ecosystem analysis was initiated under the leadership of UNDP with the participation of other UN agencies. This aimed to provide a comprehensive SDG indicators’ mapping and evaluate the capacity of INE to identify, collect, analyse and measure the SDG indicators in Guinea-Bissau. 

UNICEF, as custodian or co-custodian for 10 SDG indicators but also a key player in statistics in the country, is well positioned to strengthen coordination and collaboration with other stakeholders for enhancing national capacity in this area. In this regard, two innovative initiatives have been supported by UNICEF to ensure real-time monitoring;  using the RapidPro platform for birth registration and the mWater software in the WASH sector. 

Over the past years, the Ministry of Justice has not been able to produce vital statistics, in particular the number of registered births. The option of computerizing the whole civil registration system is very costly and not necessarily adapted to the context of a country with frequent power outages. To address this, UNICEF supported an innovative approach, using SMS with ordinary mobile phones to collect data that is entered immediately in a database, where information can be easily monitored. Managed by the Ministry of Justice, this RapidPro platform aims at monitoring in real-time the number of boys and girls from different age groups whose birth are registered throughout the country. The programme has been tested since early October 2018 involving 22 civil registration centres, out of 55 in the country. It is expected that the system will be fully operational in 2019, when the remaining centres will be integrated. Results so far are very promising, and there is a keen interest in the Ministry to scale up the experience.

In the WASH sector, UNICEF has developed another real time monitoring system utilizing the mWater online platform. Data is gathered through smartphones and entered in the cloud-based database, ensuring that information is available to all users, provided there is an internet connection available. The platform is managed by the Ministry of Natural Resources and contains data on WASH in schools, in health facilities, waterpoint existence and status,  villages’ sanitation status and WASH product markets. During 2018 the platform was further enhanced through the introduction of all borehole logs available in the Ministry of Natural Resources. This will be very helpful for future drilling operations and for the creation of more precise hydrogeological maps. The centralized data allows for equity analysis, as it makes it possible to visualize all information on geographic maps.

Based on lessons learned, UNICEF is considering extending these two innovative solutions to other sectors such as health and education.  

As highlighted, the country suffered from persistent political and institutional instability in 2018, as in the previous years. There was discontinuity in Government and Ministries, resulting in a high turn-over of the public administration civil servants, including at General Director and technical levels. This hampered progress in policy formulation and programme implementation as new appointed civil servants need to be acquainted with the ongoing technical work. In addition, regional and local administrations have limited capacities and resources and decentralized services are limited. 

In this challenging context, one key lesson learned was the relevance of the strategy adopted by UNICEF together with partners, to place greater focus on essential service delivery to the most excluded children and families, through partnering with NGOs, prioritizing community mobilization and building on capacities at local level. Up to 70 per cent of the health programme budget in 2018 was dedicated to service delivery activities. Working with NGOs as implementing partners, the network of community health workers functioning at local level was strengthened and essential treatment for diarrhoea, pneumonia and malaria was successfully delivered to more than 70 per cent of children under five. Similarly, the WASH programme achieved considerable progress in rural sanitation, working closely with NGOs to introduce the community-led total sanitation approach on a large scale. A total of 1,152 communities were declared open defecation free, out of the 4,017 communities in the country. One entire region was also certified open defecation free. 

UNICEF continued to support ‘community solutions’ by empowering them to have a bigger responsibility in managing and monitoring social services, for example, through school management and water point committees.

Although there is a certain reliance on NGOs/CSOs for service delivery at local level, the Government is in charge of the coordination and monitoring of activities in the field, especially when NGOs are involved as implementing partners. For example, within the community health programme, national health authorities led monthly meetings with UNICEF and implementing NGOs to analyse programme progress, identify bottlenecks or constraints and propose solutions for improvement. The supervision of community health workers, a key factor in the success of the programme, is also ensured by health area managers. Similarly, all villages that reach the open defecation free status were controlled and certified by the government officials who regularly conduct supervision visits in the field. The community-led total sanitation approach is therefore fully owned and supported by the Ministry of Natural Resources.

To address the lack of adequate human resource quantity and quality in social services as well as frequent changes in technical leadership and weak accountability systems, actions were initiated within the comprehensive public administration reform being implemented with the support of UNDP and the European Union. The reform aims at establishing a databank that centralizes all information on human resources in public administration as an integral management information system under the Ministry of Public Service. It will also define for each civil servant’s position the job description, required minimum diploma and education level, with the aim to guarantee that those who are nominated have the required capacity corresponding to their grade and department.  

One of the important steps reached in 2018 was the optimization of education and health staff information with the elimination of “ghost” civil servants (722 in the education sector). The reform also concerns the establishment of an appropriate career plan for civil servants including in education and health. To complement this exercise, UNICEF supported the Ministry of Education in improving the recruitment process of teachers. Sustained advocacy by UNICEF and education partners resulted in upgrading the human resources unit into a full-fledged directorate. In addition, a committee was created by the Ministry to revise the contracting process of teachers based on recommendations made as part of the reform process of the Public Service Ministry. 

Within this context, a key strategy for UNICEF was the systematic inclusion of capacity building of government partners in all projects or interventions. In some cases, especially in immunization, UNICEF explored the possibility to assign direct technical assistance in ministries, in the form of a consultant that can provide on-the-job capacity building. 

Partnerships with national and international NGOs, universities and major intergovernmental organizations were key in achieving results for children during 2018. Some of the international NGOs that UNICEF partnered with included: Plan International, Humanity and Inclusion, Institute Marques de Vale Flor and VIDA supporting programmes in education and health. With academic institutions, partnerships took place with University of Bicocca (Italy), which facilitated a PhD student attached to the WASH section as intern to systematize and visualize all drilling data, and with the University Catolica of Bissau in the framework of an international symposium on early childhood development. In addition, UNICEF partnered with Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation and the University of Minho in Portugal to revise primary school curriculum. 

Partnerships with other UN agencies (particularly UNDP, UNFPA, WFP, WHO ) and the World Bank are also well established. The overall value of these partnerships lies in the opportunity to contribute to: 
Joint advocacy with Government and various ministerial departments for children’s rights, especially for adopting national legislation, strategies and guidelines in line with international human rights instruments and standards. It also includes advocacy with Ministry of Finance and Economy regarding investing in social sectors. 
Evidence generation which can inform advocacy, policy development and programming;  
Policy reforms benefiting from the expertise and knowledge of large intergovernmental organizations that offer technical expertise and knowledge from experiences in other countries. 

Mobilizing resources for development programmes in Guinea-Bissau has not been easy with the continuous political instability. UNICEF helped leverage resources for immunization in facilitating the country submission for GAVI funding. In HIV, a major constraint this year was the stock out of some ARV drugs for a period of three months. The Brazilian Government donated drugs, which helped address this gap. However, a key concern is that the need for  ARVs for people living with HIV are beyond the planning figure of the Global Fund grant. In 2018, funding was provided to cover 12,000 people under treatment while there were about 14,000 people in need of ARVs. To fill the gap, in December, the Global Fund approved additional US$1.67 million in the framework of the prioritized above-allocation request.

For the UNICEF country programme, despite some successful resource mobilization in health, nutrition and education, funding gaps remain. Only 64 per cent of resources planned were mobilized for the year. In community health, funding from the European Union ends in October 2019. Funding from the World Bank is expected to partially fill the gap. In 2018, UNICEF did not receive any funding for its programme on female genital mutilation/cutting from the global joint programme with UNFPA and funding for birth registration through the Peacebuilding Fund ended in December with no additional resources secured for 2019. 

To ensure partner’s efficiency in the use of funds and alignment with identified needs and work plans, UNICEF Guinea-Bissau regularly conducted programme monitoring visits, financial spot checks and audits, as per the UN guidelines on harmonized approach to cash transfers. During the year, 71 documented programme monitoring visits, 15 spot checks and three audits were conducted, representing 126 per centof the planned assurance activities.

Overall, 2018 was a strategic year for UNICEF Guinea-Bissau with the MTR conducted. This allowed UNICEF to take stock of results to date since the beginning of the country programme and set the strategies and priorities for the next two years. This participatory process resulted in adjustments in the country programme targets, but also in the programme structure with the integration of HIV/AIDS component into the health and nutrition programme. It also led to a strengthened focus on gender programming during 2019-2020. Reflection on the context of fragility was also an opportunity to confirm the strategic choices of the country programme with a strong emphasis on service delivery, capacity building and community empowerment.

WCAR,Liberia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
The change in government administration after 12 years led to a prolonged transition, with many positions at all levels remaining unfilled for protracted periods. During that time ministries were not fully functional, resulting in a three-month freezing of funds transfer from UNICEF to the Government and delaying programme implementation. The change in government also meant that coordination between ministries was weaker in the first half of the year and the focus was primarily on transforming the President’s manifesto into the PAPD and less on implementation.

Attrition rates of staff in key areas such as health and child protection were high. This led to loss of knowledge and capacity in an environment where the capacity and skills of government are generally already low. Skills in supply and logistics management were particularly scarce, exacerbating the difficulties in distributing supplies caused by poor road conditions, particularly during the six-month rainy season. This poor transport connectivity also hindered outreach to rural populations and made access to services difficult for the poorest and most remote communities.

Another major constraint was limited funding and resources. Funding to Liberia dropped substantially with the end of the Ebola Viral Disease crisis, leading to a shortfall in UNICEF Liberia 2018 funding of 29 per cent (UNICEF raised just under US$10 million out of a target of US$14 million). This funding shortfall also impacted programme implementation due to resulting difficulties in employing and retaining critical staff. In the context of Liberia’s extensive poverty and poorly performing economy, fraud risk was another major obstacle to smooth programme implementation.

There was an overall lack of data and research on issues affecting children in Liberia, with disaggregated data unavailable for many key indicators. This lack of robust and up-to-date data impeded programme prioritization and precise targeting of the most vulnerable children.

Full realization of children’s rights was hampered by the fact that the Children’s Law of 2011 was only partially implemented, with no regulatory framework or standard operating procedures in place. For example, when a child is referred for case management, there is no common understanding among the various ministries and actors involved of the processes that need to occur and in what order, nor who is responsible for what, including for the links between statutory and non-statutory service providers. 

Lessons learned 

What gets measured gets done. The inclusion of nutrition indicators in the HMIS  catalysed improved accountability among health workers, led to improved availability of nutrition services and enabled timely evidence-based decision making. 

The child-friendly communities initiative increased synergy and convergence among the UNICEF sectors of nutrition and health. Preliminary implementation of the initiative indicated it improved feedback loops and programme adjustment focusing on integration and convergence of all UNICEF programmes and addressed overlapping deprivations of children. This included initiatives in child protection, communication for development (C4D), health, nutrition and WASH. 

The Ministry of Health, which is responsible for community-led total sanitation programming, reported that some communities that were declared open defecation free slid back to open defecation, although the extent of backsliding was not fully established. This highlighted the challenge of sustaining outcomes in this area. The following steps were suggested to address that challenge: strengthening post-open defecation free monitoring through the use of local natural leaders and community based organisations; and engaging and promoting ownership of programming by the local Ministry of internal Affairs at community, district and county levels. 

In the context of limited resources, it is vital that areas of intervention be chosen carefully and that those that will deliver the maximum results for children are prioritized. This involves pooling resources through a multisectoral approach to achieve efficiency and the highest possible return for every dollar spent, as well as finding innovative ways to mobilize resources. Sustainability must be built into interventions from the beginning if results are to be embedded in society. Another factor in the success or otherwise of UNICEF interventions is a strong relationship between national policy/strategic reforms and indicator outcomes: without Government policy or reform to support them, UNICEF programmes struggle to succeed.

In 2018, the best results for Liberian children were achieved through working with community structures and community-based organizations. The community health assistant CHA programme is an example of the success of this approach. The involvement of CHAs/community health volunteers was critical to achieving high rates of immunization and nutritional supplementation coverage. Behaviour change also was best achieved through engagement at the community level

The overall lack of quality, disaggregated data and research in Liberia was an issue and must be addressed in future programme design. This may include improving over all data collection methods, reducing the overall number of indicators, as well as choosing and crafting them with care.

Approximately one-quarter of Liberia’s population lives in Montserrado County, where there is a high concentration of wealth and services. This fact can distort statistics when they are averaged nationwide, creating a statistical success but a failure to reach the poorest and most vulnerable and marginalized. Following the regional approach that the new government has outlined in the Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development strategy is expected to help overcome this issue.

Due to the change in government, the current Government of Liberia–UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation was extended to the end of 2019. This decision was taken to allow the United Nations Country Team to ensure that planning for the next United Nations Development Assistance Framework cycle is fully aligned with the new national priorities and development planning cycle of the new Government of Liberia. UNICEF thus has a full year to integrate the lessons learned in 2018 into its planning not just for 2019 but also for the next four-year Country Programme of Cooperation, which will begin in 2020.

Priorities will be chosen carefully based on where UNICEF can have the greatest impact and where results for children can be maximized, given the context of limited fiscal space and contraction of UNICEF resources. The priorities selected will also be aligned with the Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development(including following the strategy’s regional approach), as well as the SDGs, key results for children, the UNICEF Strategic Plan and UNDevelopment Assistance Framework, in order to maximize synergies and avoid duplication of efforts. A strong focus will be placed on multi-sectoral programming and community-based approaches, as these proved the most effective strategies in 2018 for deep and sustainable change that improves the lives of Liberian children. 

The Government and UNICEF, in collaboration with civil society, children’s representatives, adolescents, and the private sector, undertook a ‘Strategic Moment of Reflection’ to discuss issues facing children in Liberia, review progress in implementation of the current UNICEF-supported programme in the country, and identify ideas areas of priority focus for the next UNICEF-supported country programme of cooperation (2020 – 2024). Participants agreed that the programme should focus on preventing violence against children, increasing birth registration, reducing under five mortality and stunting, improving adolescent nutrition, ending open defecation, and increasing equitable access to inclusive quality education at early childhood education and primary levels, particularly for girls. Those programmes would be in line with UNICEF’s global and regional goals. A review of skill sets for implementation of such programmes was also initiated.

WCAR,Mali,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Point-of-care (ALEREQ) as a strategy to accelerate paediatric HIV care in Mali 

Background/Issue: Using innovative approaches to deliver services is likely to yield more results for children. Mali had a low average enrolment of HIV-positive children on ART (200 per annum) between 2010 and 2016 compared to an average of 2,000 adults and a very low viral load suppression level in children already on ART (only 26 per cent). The main reason is the weak identification and referral system for children. 

Strategies: To improve the situation, in line with Mali’s 2017–2018 catch-up plan to enrol  1,275 new HIV positive children each year in treatment, a new approach was introduced to fast track the achievement of the 90-90-90 targets for children by 2020. The dual point-of-care for early infant HIV-diagnostic and viral load technology (AlereQ) was introduced. This state-of-the-art device was provided to 10 districts and the capacity of health workers built for improving the survival of HIV-positive infants through an early identification and initiation of ART. To ensure ownership, sustainability, capacity building and skill transfer, UNICEF opted to strengthen the government system. Districts and health facilities whose technical teams are the direct implementers of the programme were identified by the Government. A solid partnership was established with not only the Government at central and decentralized levels, but also with UNAIDS and WHO and other partners in the health and HIV sectors.  

Results: Within a four-month period, 281 infants were tested using AlereQ in 10 districts, compared with 271 infants tested in one year in 75 districts nationwide. Most importantly, the 31 infants identified HIV-positive through AlereQ were immediately initiated on ART.  

Lessons learned:  
Early diagnosis of HIV is feasible and can be expanded rapidly to improvepaediatric HIV response.  
The full support, buy-in and ownership of the Government at national and district levels was instrumental in rolling out the new approach.  

Next steps: Looking forward, efforts will be deployed including additional partnerships for scaling up AlereQ to other health facilities. The focus will be on high load facilities with high yield, using all suitable health, nutrition and community services delivery entry points. Remaining areas of work will be the integration and linkage with other maternal, newborn and child health and nutrition interventions in line with the new Country Programme 2020–2024 vision of integrated, community-level programmes. 

Youths demonstrate their potential and the use of innovative tools 

Access to education remains a major issue in Mali. It is estimated that over one million children aged 7-12 are out of school and at risk of rights violations. Every year, UNICEF Mali organizes Back to School (BTS) campaigns to inform communities on the importance of enrolling children in schools, with a focus on girls. 

During the 2018 BTS campaign conducted nationwide, in addition to Child Ambassadors, UNICEF trained 1,690 youth (825 girls), as Second Decade for Education facilitators in interpersonal communication and how to raise awareness among parents and communities about the importance of education. They were also provided with 1,000 telephones to collect data and learnt how to use the RapidPro based tool Edutrac.  

Three major steps were taken: 
Three weeks before school opening, trained youths accompanied BTS Child Ambassadors to conduct home visits to inform parents on the importance of enrolling or facilitating children’s return to school. Several youth groups (girls and boys) went door to door for five days, visiting 10 households a day to meet with parents and children and discuss issues regarding the importance of education. They also took part in interactive radio programmes and conveyed key messages on girls’ education. 
Two weeks after school opening, the youth visited the same households for a second time, to collect data on children who were enrolled for the first time as well as those who returned to school. 
 A week later, youth received a questionnaire developed from Edutrac via SMS on their telephones. They answered the questionnaire with the data collected and sent it back to UNICEF by responding to the SMS.  

Youth dynamism combined with technological innovation helped to measure the results achieved. Edutrac data revealed that 2,186 BTS Child Ambassadors directly helped enrol 22,025 children and return 9,324 others to school. Real-time monitoring with data generated by young people are powerful tools that can support the Government and partners to plan and make decisions.  

Lessons learned. Generating evidence is key for communication for development. In the framework of Generation Unlimited, UNICEF can position the second decade to contribute to promotion of key family practices and use technological innovations to generate data on health, water, hygiene and sanitation, nutrition and child protection. 

As an added value, they helped provide evidence that the communication campaign achieved results, while raising participation and engagement. It also meets, to some extent, a need expressed by young people during the strategic moment of reflection to be allowed to plan, execute and evaluate their activities themselves. 

Way forward.  To scale up the strategy, UNICEF Mali will align youth programming to its KRCs: immunization plus, quality education, child marriage, stunting. If youth engagement is channelled towards the KRCs and given the necessary support to conduct activities, youth will co-create, innovate, and deploy their full potential. Youth will help collect data and inform programming, and their commitment to their own communities will contribute to more sustainable results. Of importance is the engagement of girls, as the available avenues for their participation remain limited. 

Integrated programming approach to maximize impact on children 

The 2015-2019 Country Programme has a general objective to support the Government of Mali to increase equitable access to basic social services, strengthen the resilience of communities, support service delivery systems and promote policies and budgets that are sensitive to the situation of the most disadvantaged groups and children, while ensuring a better transition from humanitarian action to development. 

Considering the community-based health care initiative and deprivation analyses that have shown half of the poor children who suffered from at least three deprivations were living in central region of Mopti and southern Sikasso, the programme focusses on these two regions. In Mopti and Sikasso,the aim was for all components of the country programme to offer integrated service packages in communities, schools and health centres. These interventions would be guided by a participatory approach to strengthen the capacity of rights holders and duty bearers while working for social change, local ownership and equity-based programming. The prevention of chronic malnutrition was to serve as an entry point for the establishment of a set of high impact interventions. Thus, nutrition activities would be combined with health, water and sanitation, education and food security interventions to promote a preventive, multisectoral and integrated approach and generate optimal benefits. UNICEF Mali has offices in these two regions and staff in each sector of intervention. 

To support the process of developing a new Country Programme for  2020–2024, UNICEF Mali conducted an evaluation of the approach in December to draw lessons and make recommendations to better define appropriate strategies. The evaluation revealed the following.

Relevance of the approach: The integrated approach was relevant as the nature of the interventions aligned with and contributed to the priorities identified in the UNICEF strategic framework, in the UNDAF, and supported the priorities in national policies and strategies. 

Coherence of the approach: The concept of the integrated programming approach was not based on a well-articulated and integrated theory of change. Although the changes expected by each of the sectoral components of the integrated programs of Sikasso and Mopti appear to be complementary and relevant, the establishment of a harmonized understanding of the integrated approach within the UNICEF team would have led to greater adherence to the approach. There was no monitoring mechanism to demonstrate how the integrated approach was more or less efficient than the traditional approach of implementation by sector. 

Effectiveness and efficiency of the approach: The programme achieved a considerable number of expected results considering the implementation context and the timeframe. However, the monitoring and reporting system did not fully reflect the work done by UNICEF. The planning cycle followed the usual sectoral approach, and the inadequacies of the monitoring and evaluation mechanism have not favoured the establishment of an integrated approach. The budget structure did not allow an analysis of the efficiency of the programme: whether the resources were used well nor to confirm that the results were achieved at lower cost than previously.  

Lessons learned 
The process of designing and planning complex multi-sectoral integrated programmes must be based on an adapted, specific and concerted approach, ensuring the participation of all the sectors of intervention concerned. It must ensure a harmonized understanding of the proposed integrated vision and the definition of consistent, unifying and measurable statements of results. 
The effectiveness of a programme implies the efficiency of the management and use of the data and the information it generates. Multiplying data collection tools without convergence and integrated vision can quickly become detrimental to a team's effectiveness. 
The implementation of integrated programmes must result in an operational strategy. This should stipulates how the integrated vision of the programme will be articulated, specify the roles,responsibilities and accountabilities of each actor (country office, zone offices, sections, programme monitoring and evaluation unit), outline the schedule, the implementation sequence and the monitoring protocols. 
An integrated programming approach must be unifying for all programme sections and reflect the needs and priorities identified according to the strategic reference guidelines including, for example, the child development cycle and the Key Results for Children, without forgetting the specificities of each area of intervention. As a result, it may be too restrictive to offer a single-entry point for the entire programme. 

Way forward 
For the 2020-2024 Country Programme an integrated theory of change and results framework will be developed and aligned to UNDAF and UNICEF 2018-2021 Strategic Plan. A life cycle approach will be developed to ensure integration of interventions; 
To move forward with an integrated programming approach, which is also considered promising, dedicated brainstorming exercises will be conducted to agree on a common vision of the integrated approach; 
One of the determinants of the success of an integrated approach will be community involvement and engagement. It will be important to carry out a more comprehensive analysis of the multisectoral coordination mechanisms, considering the decentralization process, and the roles and responsibilities of the key stakeholders. 

Outlook for 2019 

2019 is the last year of the UNDAF and the UNICEF Country Programme 2015–2019. UNICEF has started the process of developing a new Country Programme for 2020–2024. A strategic moment of reflection workshop was conducted with key stakeholders including the Government, other United Nations agencies, non-governmental organizations, children and youth, to discuss and define strategic priorities and identify alternative solutions for a transformative agenda for children and young people. The workshop highlighted the need to mainstream the life cycle approach and involve more young people as agents of change into the new programme cycle. The new Country Programmewill be in line with the new UNDAF 2020–2024 that is being developed, and in conformity with the Strategic Plan Common Chapter (with UNDP, UNFPA and UN Women) as well as the UN Integrated Strategy for the Sahel. 

The programme context will have the Integrated Strategic Framework as its backdrop; and will be based on the complementarity and comparative advantage of relevant UNexpertise and resources in Mali – both MINUSMA and the United Nations Country Team – to ensure coordinated and integrated support to the peace process as per Security Council Resolution 2423 (2018). The MINUSMA mandate was renewed in June for another year with its peacekeeping, police and civilian presence to accelerate the implementation of the Peace Agreement.  

Under the framework of Generation Unlimited, the Government is calling on UNICEF Mali to reinforce its programmes for the empowerment of those in their second decade of life. This was re-emphasized during the visit of the UNICEF Executive Director in May. Reflections have been initiated to design innovative youth approaches tailored to gender and regional contexts and with the involvement of the private sector, which will enable Malian youth to unleash their full potential and contribute to a more peaceful and prosperous country.

• Le renforcement des capacités nationales : un enjeu central 

Au niveau régional et départemental, il existe un déficit avéré, en ressources humaines et en moyens financiers, logistiques et équipements pour assurer le bon fonctionnement des services et les activités de supervision. Le renforcement des mécanismes de coordination et des capacités de planification, de suivi de la mise en œuvre et de gestion des ressources existantes sont des priorités communes pour les PTF : 

- Dans le secteur santé, en réponse aux différents processus de diagnostic sectoriel, d’audit et contrôles réalisés (l’audit institutionnel de l’UE, l’audit GAVI, SC- HACT) et au processus de centralisation de la gestion des financements de certains PTF, au niveau de la Direction des affaires financières, des initiatives de renforcement conjoint et coordonné des capacités de gestion, de suivi et de contrôle ont été engagées. Elles seront poursuivies et renforcées en 2019, de concert avec la BM, UE, Fonds Mondial, GAVI, FNUAP et OMS. Ces initiatives devraient contribuer aussi à améliorer les capacités d’absorption des ressources, et le suivi ainsi que la justification des ressources allouées au niveau déconcentré. 

- Dans la plupart des secteurs sociaux couverts par le Programme de Coopération Mauritanie-UNICEF, les revues sectorielles, les missions de supervision et les activités de monitorage en temps réel (RTM) constatent un besoin de renforcement des capacités des structures déconcentrées et décentralisées pour optimiser la mise en œuvre des programmes. Le niveau opérationnel (directions régionales et services départementaux et communaux) est confronté à des enjeux récurrents : déficit chronique en personnel, absentéisme et manque d’opportunités de supervision et de formation continue, faible disponibilité en temps utile des budgets déconcentrés ainsi que d’importantes contraintes logistiques telles que le déficit en équipement et la faible maintenance des infrastructures. Ces contraintes fragilisent la mise en œuvre, le suivi et la pérennité des activités et perpétuent une dépendance forte vis-à-vis les partenaires. Pour relever ces défis, une attention particulière a été accordée à l’appui aux mécanismes déconcentrés et décentralisés. De même, au niveau des communes, plusieurs défis subsistent notamment l’opérationnalisation effective des plans communaux de développement. Devant ce constat, il sera essentiel de renforcer les mécanismes de planification et de suivi locaux et de favoriser les synergies entre les interventions multi-sectorielles au niveau communautaire.

- Il existe un consensus autour de l’importance de mettre en place des zones de convergence/concentration régionales afin de : (i) démontrer/documenter la validité, l’efficience et la pérennité des stratégies nationales au niveau opérationnel dans le but d’influencer la prise de décisions concernant les ajustements nécessaires dans le cadre des réformes sectorielles, (ii) identifier et corriger les goulots d’étranglement ayant un impact négatif sur la mise en œuvre des activités opérationnelles et l’atteinte de résultats tangibles pour les bénéficiaires, (iii) explorer de façon plus systématique les enjeux spécifiques rencontrés et les stratégies de réponse à mettre en œuvre en fonction des différents contextes avec notamment, une attention renforcée accordée aux diversités socio-culturelles, aux dynamiques de population et aux nouvelles problématiques du milieu urbain et péri-urbain et iv) améliorer l’efficacité et l’efficience des programmes. Cette approche a été adoptée par le SNU dans le cadre de la mise en œuvre du CPDD 2018-2022 (UNDAF) avec un accent sur trois régions (HEC, Guidimakha et la zone péri-urbaine défavorisée de Nouakchott). La BM et le Gouvernement ont aussi adopté cette approche pour le nouveau Programme Inaya/Santé (Régions du Guidimakha et du HEG) où seront mises en œuvre des interventions visant la couverture médicale universelle (CMU) et le renforcement de la santé communautaire et de l’accès des plus pauvres au système (via un mécanisme de transfert monétaire adossé au programme Tekavoul de lutte contre la pauvreté). UNICEF est activement impliqué et fait partie du Comité de pilotage du programme Inaya. Les nouveaux projets BM/Gouvernement en phase de formulation dans les secteurs Education et WASH vont aussi adopter cette approche régionalisée. C’est également le cas pour les programmes de AFD (forfait obstétrical dans l’Assaba) et EU/PASS (CMU/Mutuelles de santé à Nouakchott et au Brakna).

Ces différentes initiatives sont centrales et nécessaires pour renforcer la mise en œuvre des programmes dans le contexte mauritanien. Ce sont des axes stratégiques du nouveau programme de coopération 2018-2022 indispensables pour améliorer l’atteinte et la soutenabilité des interventions en vue d’atteindre les KRC et les ODD.

• Les innovations : catalyseurs de changement en faveur des enfants

Devant les enjeux décrits plus tôt, le bureau a tenu des sessions de « brainstorming » sur les innovations afin d’explorer diverses avenues possibles « pour faire les choses différemment » et trouver des solutions mieux adaptées aux problèmes rencontrés. Pour donner suite à la mission du conseiller régional en innovation et à la journée dédiée aux innovations lors de la revue à mi-année, le bureau a poursuivi sa réflexion en redynamisant le comité « Innovations » et en développant une stratégie sur les innovations selon trois piliers stratégiques. Le premier pilier est axé sur l’application de technologies et de processus novateurs pour la collecte, l’analyse et la diffusion de données axées sur l’action. Testé au HEC et au Guidimakha, le RTM offre l’opportunité d’améliorer la qualité des données tout en impliquant les acteurs locaux pour atteindre de meilleurs résultats en faveur des enfants. Le deuxième pilier s’est dessiné à la suite d’une opportunité de partenariat avec la Fondation Akelius, à travers le Comité suédois, afin de faciliter l’apprentissage du français aux enfants déscolarisés ou marginalisés à travers une plateforme digitale. Un projet pilote est en cours de développement avec l’appui du Comite suédois, de la Fondation Akelius, du BR et du Siège. Il s’inscrit dans une initiative interpays (Grèce ; Liban, Mauritanie) et permettra de dynamiser et accélérer la réflexion nationale autour du e-learning. Enfin, le troisième pilier repose sur le constat que le pays enregistre un fort taux de pénétration du téléphone mobile et une augmentation rapide de l’accès à internet (passé de 41% en 2016 à 46% en 2017 en milieu urbain). Les informations pouvant sauver des vies ou bien les initiatives visant à collecter l’avis des bénéficiaires finaux/détenteurs de droits peuvent désormais être rapidement diffusées ou traitées via Internet, les applications mobiles (WhatsApp) et les SMS. Ces dispositifs seront renforcés pour compléter les canaux traditionnels de commu
nication, accélérer la participation et le contrôle citoyen. Un poste T4D a été créé lors du PBR 2018 afin de mieux matérialiser et accélérer ces initiatives.

• L’importance et les enjeux de la préparation aux urgences 

Devant la récurrence croissante des épisodes de sècheresse et d’inondation ainsi que la situation sécuritaire toujours précaire et complexe au Mali, la préparation du bureau-pays aux urgences est essentielle. Une attention particulière a été portée sur la sécurisation du pipeline RUTF, le pré-positionnement d’un stock de contingence WASH et la préparation d’un accord avec le Croissant-Rouge visant le renforcement des capacités nationales de préparation et réponse aux urgences soudaines, avant la saison des pluies (septembre-octobre). Ces derniers efforts ont été essentiels à la réponse aux inondations de septembre à Bassikounou. Le bureau a participé aux efforts de renforcement de capacités nationales pour la réduction des risques de catastrophes à travers l’initiative CADRI, mais dont la formulation peine à se concrétiser. Afin d’assurer une coordination optimale entres les différentes initiatives, un mécanisme de coordination renforcé devra être mis en place entre la partie nationale (Protection Civile du Ministère de l’Intérieur), le SNU, les PTF et les ONG sous le leadership du Gouvernement. 

• Mobilisation de ressources

Les financements ORR prédictibles et pluriannuels reçus de la coopération néerlandaises (DGIS) dans le cadre du programme Régional Eau-Assainissement-Hygiène ont permis de construire des partenariats solides et stables, de sécuriser les interventions prioritaires et d’accélérer l’atteinte des résultats à l’échelle nationale, mais aussi ils ont donné au programme l’opportunité de consolider et documenter les acquis et de créer des leviers efficaces pour mobiliser davantage de financements et d’autres partenaires du secteur, tels que l’AFD, la BID, BAD et la BM, en faveur de l’assainissement. Ce type financement, malheureusement rare, est en effet très bénéfique et structurant pour le secteur. Il aura permis d’une part, d’accélérer l’atteinte des résultats sur l’élimination de la défécation à l’air libre, et d’autre part, de renforcer les capacités au niveau national et décentralisé, en termes de collecte et de traitement des données WASH, mais aussi de favoriser des thématiques et approches nouvelles comme l’introduction de technologies à faibles coûts, le contrôle de durabilité et le renforcement des mécanismes nationaux et locaux de suivi et évaluation. Des efforts sont déployés, en collaboration avec le BR et le Siège, mais aussi les Comités nationaux, en vue de poursuivre la recherche de ce type de ressources ORR pluriannuelles/prédictibles en appui à la réalisation des objectifs du programme pays. Dans le secteur WASH, les discussions avec le Global Partnership for Water se poursuivront afin d’explorer les opportunités nouvelles notamment dans le cadre des fonds verts pour le climat. Dans le domaine de l’Education, la qualification du pays pour la nouvelle phase du programme « School for Africa » à partir de 2019 pourrait être aussi une opportunité dans ce sens. Dans le contexte favorable de la réforme des NU, une autre piste importante et potentiellement prometteuse est le renforcement des programmes conjoints. L’année 2019 sera également marquée par la mise en
 œuvre de deux nouveaux programmes conjoints. Le premier vise l’abandon des MGF conjointement avec le FNUAP. Le deuxième vise le renforcement des capacités locales pour la prévention des conflits dans le Département de Bassiknou conjointement avec le PNUD, HCDH et FAO (Peacebuilding Fund) et est une opportunité nouvelle permettant d’attirer d’autres financements pluriannuels, tout en contribuant aux priorités communes (common chapter) le long du nexus humanitaire-développement. Simultanément, le bureau explore de façon systématique les opportunités de partenariats stratégiques qui permettent un leveraging des interventions et des ressources en faveur des KRC. 

Enfin, dans le but de répondre au déficit chronique en financement de certaines composantes du programme (particulièrement pour les programmes de développement pour lesquels seulement 37% des ressources ORR escomptées ont pu être mobilisées), le bureau s’est doté d’une stratégie de mobilisation de ressources. Des réunions bilatérales de présentation du programme de coopération 2018-2022 ont été organisées avec les principaux partenaires présents en Mauritanie. Un kit de mobilisation de ressources est en cours de développement et permettra de renforcer les efforts en la matière. 9,9 millions dollars ont été mobilisés pour la réponse aux urgences, soit 46% du budget du HAC 2018. Près des deux-tiers de ces fonds (6,1 millions dollars) ont été reçus entre avril et juin, et le reste, entre juillet et octobre. Au regard du caractère saisonnier de la réponse à l’urgence nutritionnelle dans les pays du Sahel, dont la Mauritanie, la réception tardive de ces fonds a représenté un défi pour assurer une réponse optimale aux besoins particulièrement durant la période de soudure. Il est important de noter également que seulement 16% des allocations reçues étaient non earmarked.

• Perspectives 2019

La récente conférence de coordination des partenaires et bailleurs de fonds du G5 Sahel pour le financement du programme d’investissements prioritaires (PIP) 1ère phase 2019-2021, a souligné un intérêt particulier pour le secteur de l’éducation, et notamment pour la réinsertion scolaire. Considérant aussi, comme mentionné précédemment, la sélection de la Mauritanie pour la nouvelle phase de l’initiative School for Africa, le programme l’éducation pourrait donc bénéficier d’investissements soutenus dans un avenir rapproché. Il sera important de saisir ces opportunités en vue d’accélérer l’accès à l’éducation de centaines de milliers d’enfants non scolarisés/déscolarisés et d’articuler les stratégies de changements (change strategies) ancrées au niveau communautaire (et réplicables à large échelle) en réponse aux besoins et aspirations de ces enfants, en termes de réinsertion scolaire et de formation professionnelle en ligne avec les objectifs du KRC 3. La présentation du rapport national volontaire de la Mauritanie sur les ODD lors du Forum politique de haut niveau des NU en juin 2019 sera une opportunité de poursuivre un plaidoyer fort. La nouvelle Stratégie nationale de protection de l’enfant, qui devrait être finalisée d’ici juin 2019, sera articulée autour du renforcement des systèmes de protection, le renforcement du travail social et intégrera quelques questions émergentes non prises en compte dans la dernière stratégie, comme par exemple, la question des enfants migrants. Dans le domaine du renforcement du travail social dans le pays, il sera important de pérenniser les acquis et de poursuivre le plaidoyer auprès du Gouvernement et des PTF en faveur du renforcement de capacités et de la soutenabilité financière des services de protection des enfants. L’ARNPTS sera appuyée en 2019 pour tester un modèle d’interopérabilité entre l’État civil et les structures sanitaires.

Dans le cadre des zones de convergence du SNU, le programme renforce sa concentration géographique et encourage une plus grande intersectorialité et synergie. La revue annuelle de décembre 2018, combinée avec la revue par les pairs des PTA 2019 prévue en début d’année vont permettre d’identifier les interventions conjointes et prioritaires pour 2019, renforcer l’accent sur et la contribution à l’atteinte des résultats clés pour les enfants (KRC et ODD) et s’assurer de l’intégration du suivi des observations du Comité des droits de l’enfant. 

Au niveau des opérations, le projet inter-agences de mise en place d’un système utilisant la géolocalisation sur téléphone mobile adopté par UNCT/UNDSS sera mise en œuvre à compter de 2019. De plus, avec une meilleure visibilité de la situation budgétaire en 2019, l’exercice de planification et la mise en place des nouveaux LTA permettront d’améliorer les processus d’achat et de réaliser des économies d’échelle pour accompagner la mise en œuvre du programme de manière plus optimale et efficiente. Les missions de « end user monitoring » réalisées par le personnel des opérations et des programmes ont permis d’identifier des risques importants et certaines insuffisances dans la gestion décentralisée de la chaîne d’approvisionnement. D’importantes recommandations ont été élaborées conjointement avec le programme et seront rigoureusement suivies lors des réunions programmes et CMT afin de lever les goulots d’étranglements et renforcer les capacités des partenaires dans la gestion des approvisionnements et des stocks. 

Enfin, l’équipe a été sensibilisée sur l’importance de renforcer la planification et les synergies de programmes tout au long du cycle de programmation, depuis la préparation des propositions aux bailleurs jusqu’à la mise en œuvre, au suivi et à l’évaluation. Une session de sensibilisation des partenaires ONG sur les approches intersectorielles sera organisée afin de maximiser les synergies d’intervention à tous les niveaux administratifs afin de pouvoir démontrer des résultats probants afin qu’aucun enfant ne soit laissé pour compte. Un document de plaidoyer définissant les engagements du bureau vis-à-vis les résultats clés pour les enfants sera développé et inclura des messages percutants pour influencer le dialogue politique et l’allocation budgétaire de l’État. Il sera soutenu par une série d’« investment cases » qui permettront de créer des espaces de dialogue et des dynamiques sociales en faveur des enfants particulièrement en vue de la célébration du 30e anniversaire de la signature de la CDE. 





"
WCAR,Niger,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Seven major lessons learned from the 2014–2018 programme cycle were documented and taken into account in the new country programme.

1) Development programmes need to take into account the time needed to address the structural causes of problems affecting children and be rooted in better understanding of  governance systems and of the aspirations of individuals and communities.
2) To address social norms and practices that are detrimental to children’s well-being, programme and social mobilization approaches need to be anchored holistically in communities and their diverse contexts.
3) Given the country’s vast population of children, adolescents and youth, children and young people need to be brought to the centre of national policies and decision-making processes.
4) Investments in basic social services need to account not only for coverage, but also the quality of service delivery.
5) Support provided to systems at the central and community levels should be linked to decentralized structures for more sustainable results.
6) To obtain more sustainable results, it is important to move away from a humanitarian logic leading to substitution in terms of service provision in a development context; 
7) Progress toward equity must be closely monitored, as approaches to reducing deprivation affecting the greatest number have been accompanied instead by a widening of social inequalities.

A review of implementation of the localization approach utilized by the UN system and by UNICEF during the previous cycle showed that various bottlenecks affected the sustainability of investments undertaken by UN agencies. Activities remained scattered geographically within the same municipality and implementation modalities varied across agencies (direct execution, NGO contracting, budget support). Weak ownership of the approach by municipal actors resulted in low financial contributions from municipalities to annual action plans.

Looking forward, efforts at decentralized levels will be channelled in such a way as to strengthen the decentralization process underway in education, health, water and environment, with an emphasis on support for: (1) inclusive planning and quality information systems at central and decentralized levels, (2) social accountability mechanisms at decentralized levels, (3) and capacity building of municipalities as they begin to handle their newly transferred responsibilities.

As part of development of the new country programme, UNICEF Niger streamlined a new participatory, bottom-up, human rights-based programming approach to strategic visioning and planning. The approach proved highly instrumental to steering UNICEF toward a new way of working and provided a number of lessons that will inform UNICEF’s modus operandi in the future. Although this approach was complex to operationalize, it enhanced UNICEF’s credibility and trust by partners and provided an important learning curve for UNICEF staff and partners about embedding the human rights-based approach in planning. 

The new planning method helped to establish an environment where introspective learning could take place with external partners, most prominently during a strategic moment of reflection with more than 100 partners (involving central and decentralized authorities, traditional and religious leaders, civil society and the media). As a result, significant paradigm shifts could be identified and are now reflected in the new country programme document. The country office is shaping a new method for developing rolling work plans, based on the human rights and bottleneck approaches, and of monitoring the removal of key bottlenecks during the programme cycle. The human rights and bottleneck planning approach requires significant facilitation and monitoring skills. Next steps include ensuring that UNICEF Niger can truly engage and build the capacity of partners to monitor progress through shared theories of change during annual reviews and at the end of the programme cycle.

Regarding partnerships, UNICEF’s involvement in basket funds in the health, WASH and education sectors enabled greater leveraging of resources and partnerships to strengthen systems and influence policy dialogue. Regarding winning support for the cause of children, an important lesson learned was the need to transition from traditional advocacy to positioning UNICEF as an enabler of a societal dialogue, in partnership with key social actors and influencers, to promote community-based organizations (e.g., informal youth associations or students’/parents associations) as agents of change and mobilizers at the community level.  

Regarding the challenge of achieving sustainable results at scale in the challenging context of Niger (characterized by rapid demographic growth and increased fragility due to rising cross-border security threats), modelling in targeted areas has shown potential that will be exploited through scaling up, with equity and ownership as basic principles.

An important challenge emerged in 2018, as Niger was confronted with an array of data issues during the year. The 2017 DHS could not be published due to quality issues, leaving the country without recent baseline data to monitor progress on the 2017–2021 social and economic development plan or the SDGs. Significant data quality issues persist across social sectors’ information systems. Key lessons learned include the need to: (1) enlarge the production of data to more actors in academia and the private sector, in addition to national data providers; (2) instil a results-based approach in data production and dissemination among concerned actors; (3) ensure coordinated efforts among financial and technical partners to influence data governance issues.

These lessons learned constitute the basis of the new CPD 2019–2021 and accompanying theories of change. The new results framework includes a new outcome dedicated to ‘adolescents and social norms’ and to support for positive changes in behaviour and social norms favourable to adolescents and youth, particularly girls, in their communities and families. The new outcome will also seek to promote their voices and agency in key planning and decision-making arenas. The social inclusion outcome will build on the ongoing focus on public finance and decentralization reforms, to promote inclusive planning and budgeting and bottom-up accountability mechanisms in the education, health and water sectors and strengthen capacities for quality, integrated data collection and user-friendly data analysis and dissemination in support of the country’s central and decentralized statistical systems. The results structure of sectoral programme components (health, nutrition, WASH, education and child protection) include three outputs, each dedicated to removing priority bottlenecks affecting the enabling environment, the demand for and supply and quality of basic social services for children and adolescents. 

Key shifts embodied in the new CPD include a strategic shift from a predominantly service-delivery mode to more important investments in systems-strengthening and capacity-building, including in humanitarian contexts, and implementing the basic principles of equity, accountability and ownership across all intervention design at central, decentralized and community levels.

While taking prompt action, together with national authorities, to investigate the loss of supplies along the distribution chain between health districts and beneficiaries,, the office committed to risk-mitigation measures that will be maintained and strengthened in 2019, such as: participation in the redesign process of the national supply chain, implementation of the monitoring/tracking software TrackIt and training for districts and health centres in its use and recruitment of private firms for third-party monitoring.

During 2018 information and communication technology (ICT) proved useful in tackling specific challenges linked to emergencies. For example, UNICEF deployed Thuraya phones to allow responders in localities without GSM coverage to report and send real-time alerts to a RapidPro application in the WASH, nutrition and education sectors in Diffa Region. UNICEF Niger played an active role in UN ICT team activities; the common Internet connection is constantly monitored and optimized, migration to digital VHF was completed in all the country providing innovative ways of communication and devices tracking for staff security. Looking forward, UNICEF will continue to focus on technological advances and innovations to implement the new 2019–2021 country programme.

Constraints  
Three overarching constraints hindered UNICEF programming across sectors: Funding gaps and delays; security concerns; and limited partner accountability and management capacity

Funding gaps and delays: Funding gaps and delayed release of committed funds from counterparts had a significant impact on programmes. States - which depend on federal revenue due to low state-generated revenue, non-diversification of revenue sources, high external debt and poor fiscal sustainability - were constrained in implementing fiscal policies to achieve greater equality. 

• State governments struggled to fulfil their obligations in education, including payment of teachers’ salaries and time-sensitive activities such as the annual school census. UNICEF faced challenges as the main development partner working on education in the north-east, facing a 39 per cent funding gap. This reflected activities that are not Humanitarian Action for Children under humanitarian grants, making the sector appear better-funded than it was in relation to Humanitarian Action for Children activities.

• Delays and non-release of funds, or inadequate operational funds, stalled procurement and construction processes for WASH facilities in communities and institutions. 

• Limited funding for nutrition in non-emergency contexts hindered interventions in the north-west, an area most affected by malnutrition in children. Donor funding for curative and preventive nutrition actions in this part of the country remained far below what is required to adequately address the situation. UNICEF conducted intense advocacy efforts at federal and state levels to obtain increased domestic resource investment, including media activities, discussions with legislators and meetings with the spouses of governors. This resulted in the allocation of US$ 4.6 million towards nutrition, although only US$ 3.18 million had been released by the end of 2018. The allocated amount was 30 per cent of the minimum annual funding recommended in the National Strategic Plan of Action on Nutrition. 

UNICEF strongly advocated for inclusion of programme priorities and funding needs within federal and state budgets. In addition, mid-year reviews of nine field offices and federal level sections were timed to feed into federal and state level budgeting cycles. In collaboration with government counterparts, the review process aimed to assist partners in developing and aligning funding priorities and include UNICEF-supported interventions in government budgets for better funding and sustainability of programmes.

Security concerns: Ongoing security issues, particularly in the north-east, area challenge for programme delivery to vulnerable populations. Restricted access to local government areas and settlements in the north-east impeded reaching children with vaccinations and other interventions. In Borno, 7.4 per cent of local government areas were inaccessible due to conflict. The UNICEF-supported polio programme continued efforts to reach the security-compromised areas via ‘Reaching Inaccessible Children’ and ‘Reaching Every Settlement’ strategies. Flooding in the Middle Belt states destroyed WASH facilities, which burdened programme implementation and increased water-related diseases that further strained the already limited water facilities present in communities.

UNICEF Nigeria’s work in child protection programming in the north-east entailed complex advocacy work at various levels, and the management of collecting and reporting on confidential and sensitive data, particularly on children formerly associated with non-state armed groups. In 2018, UNICEF engaged with the Nigerian security forces and partners to advocate for a handover protocol for children who are encountered during military operations. The protocol would identify alternative arrangements; avoid cohabitation of adults placed at rehabilitation centres for former non-state armed group associates; and reintegrate children formerly associated with non-state armed groups and the civilian joint task force. 

Limited partner accountability and management capacity: A major impediment to UNICEF programmes was limited partner capacity, accountability and management challenges. In health, a high turnover of government staff and frequent mobility of health workers in local government areas and facilities required rebuilding capacity for health service delivery. To improve this situation, UNICEF Nigeria worked through local government area facilitators to provide in-service training and capacity building. 

• In child protection, the operationalization of the Child Protection Information Management System at both federal and state levels was delayed due to designating focal points for the work in ministries, departments and agencies. There were delays in establishing units at the federal level, despite receiving necessary equipment and supplies

• In WASH, limited capacity, governance and accountability in state and local government area institutions affected and delayed contract awards, programme construction and procurement processes. 

• In social policy, there was insufficient technical capacity in some states to generate and analyze budget data for decision-makers. There was an absence of annual disaggregated social sector data at state and local government area levels, especially related to household poverty levels, that critically impeded evidence-based reporting on the situation of women and children.

To address these issues, UNICEF Nigeria engaged in capacity building efforts across all programme sectors. Health workers were trained on severe acute malnutrition treatment; RapidPro reporting; maternal, infant and young child feeding; nutrition in emergencies; and interpersonal communications to integrate nutrition interventions in primary health care.  

UNICEF trained over 21,000 teachers in pre-primary and primary schools and trained an additional 4,600 teachers on psychosocial support for conflict-affected children. UNICEF improved government capacity for implementing the CPIMS, which resulted in the registering of 11,801 child victims of violence for the receipt of protection services. More than 11,000 WASH committees and federations were trained to engage in dialogue and promotion of WASH activities, and 400 state and non-government organization partners gained skills in emergency preparedness and response.

Lessons learned

Based on these constraints, several lessons were learned concerning partnerships, United Nations agency coordination; cross-sectoral work; evidence-based programming; community engagement; and accountability and management systems.

Partnerships: Developing and leveraging partnerships played a role in amplifying results for children. UNICEF Nigeria’s consistent drive for coordinated, holistic, cost-effective approaches led to better collaboration and harmonization of programmatic approaches between Government and development partners. UNICEF is nationally recognized as a reliable and neutral broker, with resources to bring together stakeholders on issues pertaining to children and families. For example, UNICEF Nigeria has a strategic partnership with the Sultan Foundation for Peace and Development, led by the Sultan of Sokoto, Universal Basic Education Commission and the Federal Ministry of Education to address the crisis of out-of-school children. The UNICEF-led coordination of international development partners in support of the federal government on social protection issues was instrumental in improving programme efficiency. In addition, alliances with major community-level gatekeepers generated local knowledge of cultures, traditions and social norms for important social and behavioural change activities. In the health sector, engagement of community resource persons such as traditional birth attendants increased the uptake of prevention of mother-to-child transmission services, even though antenatal care coverage was low. 

United Nations agency coordination: In 2018, UNICEF benefited from inter-agency collaboration and successfully mobilized resources through expanded United Nations partnerships. UNICEF partnered with IOM and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) on ‘Reintegration and reconciliation of former armed non-state combatants and Boko Haram associates,’ and with United Nations Women, United Nations Population Fund, UNDP and UNESCO on the European Union Spotlight Initiative to ‘End violence against women and girls.’ Joint programming with United Nations Population Fund continued to work to eliminate female genital mutilation.  

UNICEF leveraged the Country Task Force on Monitoring and Reporting to support advocacy for children affected by armed conflict, and ensure high level decision-making processes. On the Task Force, UNICEF continues to engage with the Nigerian Security Agency and stakeholder ‘friends of children affected by armed conflict’, advocating for the adoption of the handover protocol and against the deprivation of liberty for children allegedly associated with non-state armed groups. UNICEF supported 64 joint verification missions with UNHCR and IOM at field level to assess the extent of association of 2,850 children, out of the total 3,737 children identified by the Civilian Joint Task Forcein its ranks. As a result, 833 children out of 1,617 children who were verified as associated with the Civilian Joint Task Force were separated. 

UNICEF Nigeria partnered with World Health Organization through joint planning and implementation of health sector support for maternal, newborn and child health, routine immunization and polio components. UNICEF and World Health Organization successfully advocated for the exceptional extension of GAVI support to Nigeria for an additional 10 years with a commitment of US$1.3 billion for vaccination programmes. UNICEF scaled up interventions, bolstering achievement towards results with sustainability through strategic partnership and resource leveraging. Education cash transfer programmes, in partnership with the World Bank, were implemented in three states; Sokoto state scaled-up its programme by dedicating state funding to programme expansion and sustainability. 

Collaboration with World Food Programme through long-term agreements led to logistical efficiency gains by jointly shifting port of entry for shipments from more congested and costly Lagos to Port Harcourt. 

Cross-sectoral work: Child protection interventions leveraged strategies to contribute to annual results of the country programme document and key results for children. Internal collaboration with health, communication and communication for development to integrate birth registration activities in health care delivery points and to support demand creation for birth registration in hard-to-reach communities led to demonstrable results. Child protection collaborated with education programme to develop a ‘child safeguarding policy’ that included mandatory reporting systems to improve violence prevention and response programming in schools. This also demonstrated the benefits of cross-sector programming in building children’s resiliency with risk analysis and school emergency preparedness and response plans.  

Child protection collaborated with communication for development to verify 7,786 out of 8,548 children, representing a 91 per cent coverage rate. The data will define UNICEF baselines, allocate caseloads to implementing partners, and prepare for the transition from CPIMS to PRIMERO/CPIMS+ in 2019. UNICEF Nigeria will review the children who were not accessed in 2018 due to insecurity or because they live outside the three targeted states as part of a ‘No child left behind/Every child counts’ campaign in 2019. 

In health, the launch of ‘community health influencers, promoters and services’ helped scale up interventions, and engaged and strengthened the capacity of federal and state governments to roll out the health programme with nutrition sector fully integrated.

Evidence-based programming: In 2018, UNICEF increased the use of data to improve advocacy and strengthen evidence-based management of field programmes. In vaccination programmes, the quarterly lot quality assurance sampling was used to better monitor programme progress and to develop corrective measures for poor-performing local government areas. Such monitoring improve immunization coverage and are examples of using data to improve coordination and programme planning.  

In education, UNICEF-supported research on the effect of female teachers on girls’ enrolment and retention helped to boost girls’ enrolment and increase recruitment of female teachers. In WASH, the UNICEF-supported national outcome routine mapping survey estimated WASH service levels and accessibility. This tool was used for advocacy and programmatic action at the national level and was the basis to declare the emergency status of the WASH sector in November 2018. WASH PET created awareness to invest in WASH services among authorities. 

Community engagement: In 2018, UNICEF developed new ways to engage with community members, women and youth to drive demand for improved programmes. UNICEF developed innovative ways to improve community uptake of services. 

In WASH, communities gained a sense of involvement, participation and control with the ‘WASH voice’ tool, and authorities now have a means of interacting with communities and sharing development expectations in various areas of accountability. There is more awareness as WASH information is now regularly shared on a dedicated platform. The media has become proactive in reporting WASH issues, as they have a guaranteed audience with the substantial number of persons registered on the WASH network. WASH implementation of community-led total sanitation ++, integrating sanitation marketing and financing with community-led total sanitation, accelerated uptake of improved latrines at the community level by providing different payment mechanisms for communities to pay for latrines. The sanitation marketing approach adopted two strategies: 1) involve local ‘toilet business owners’ to provide one-stop technical solution and a range of options for smart toilets, and 2) link households with government microfinance institutions and local groups for easy and accessible financing. These interventions led to the construction of 4,506 smart toilets, a four-fold increase in the rate of safely-managed toilets to traditional approaches.

In HIV/AIDS, the ‘adolescent and young people prevention’ challenge and ongoing national HIV-prevention campaign for young people are innovative ways to promote participation of young people to engage and respond to HIV issues as role models, peer influencers, agents of change, advocates and service providers.

The nutrition programme is mobilizing traditional and religious leaders in Kano state around removing negative social norms and changing behavior to create an environment that is more favorable to child feeding and overall care with the goal to improve dietary diversity.

Accountability and management systems: To address partner management and accountability, UNICEF Nigeria helped increase efficiency and effectiveness of programmes and partners. Recognizing the country’s inability to adequately account for mOPV2 vaccines provided from the stockpile of the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision in 2016 and 2017, UNICEF Nigeria supported the deployment of ward vaccine accountability officers during mOPV2 campaigns and adoption of the S-VAM improved vaccine accountability and management during subsequent rounds. UNICEF supported the establishment of the national measles/yellow fever technical coordinating committee, which improved planning and implementation of campaigns. 

UNICEF Nigeria WASH teams held contract-review meetings with stakeholders, trained supervisors at local government area levels, conducted joint monitoring with third party monitors/facilitators, and provided weekly updates on contract works. These efforts monitored construction works to ensure quality and timeliness of completion. Such training and re-training of WASH committees using the expanded approach improved WASH committees’ effectiveness and increased their sustainability.

UNICEF Nigeria contributed to the development and finalization of standard operating procedures for community-based mechanisms including information sharing protocols, awaiting approval from Operational Humanitarian Country Team and head of agencies. UNICEF Nigeria conducted a series of trainings reaching 222 child protection actors on gender-based violence core concepts; gender-based violence case management and on protection from sexual exploitation and abuse.

"
WCAR,Republic of Cameroon,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Based on UNICEF Cameroon comparative advantage, the country programme planned to make measurable differences for child rights in all five goal areas of the 2018 /2021 strategic plan. For this purpose, interventions are aimed to influence quality to meet the demand (quantitative/qualitative) and utilization of basic social services in favor of vulnerable children. Interventions in the enabling environment aim to influence national, sectoral and local development policies to extend programme benefits to children living beyond geographical focus.  

In 2018, aside from the aggravation of the crisis in the Anglophone regions, there were no significant changes in bottlenecks. Even though emergency in North-west and South-west regions expanded the programme’s geographical coverage, its theory of change and planned results are still relevant to child rights’ issues that the country programme is striving to improve. Cameroon still needs to achieve Millennium Development Goals and accelerate implementation of commitments of the 2030 Agenda. Young adults and youth need UNICEF support in all relevant domains.  

According to the theory of change, the country programme focuses on: improving the quality of services provided to the population, reinforcing capacity of caregivers, families and communities; addressing sociocultural norms and practices harmful to children; and improving the policy environment, systems and social norms by mainstreaming child rights, gender and equity in national, sectoral and local development plans, policies and strategies.  

In 2018, programme interventions made use of three major cross-cutting strategies: communication for development, capacity development, and advocacy and partnership. Since socio-cultural practices and beliefs are sometimes bottlenecks, communication for development generated evidence of awareness and adoption of essential family practices by communities at grassroot level. Dialogue was built with communities and influences identified to create a snow-ball effect in favor of children. The Polio Legacy framework facilitated community engagement. Capitalization of Polio Legacy engaged administrative authorities, traditional rulers, community leaders and civil society, operating dialogue platforms to reinforce accountability to children in their communities.  

Programme efforts to achieve change in children’s lives were weakened by constraints that emerged in the programmatic environment. The most important hinderance was the persistence of the situation demanding humanitarian response in six of the ten regions of the country. Many interventions planned could not be implemented because of insecurity especially in North-west, South-west and Far-north regions.  

Likewise, competing investment priorities did not permit Government to meet its commitments to improve access to social services. The share of the public budget allocated to social sectors decreased from 24.5 (2017) to 22.4 (2018). In these budgetary allocations, inflexible costs such as staffing and services leave limited resources for investment to bridge access gaps, especially in the most vulnerable zones where health centers and schools are understaffed and lack basic equipment, furniture and supplies. Consequently, the inadequate quality of services provided to children negatively impacts demand and effective coverage of services. The demand created by community engagement interventions could not be satisfied and failed to meet families and communities’ expectations. 

Due to these constraints, the immunization uptake and quick release of children detained did not take place as planned. The political will required for an immediate implementation of Government commitment is still a concern. School enrolment of children and of those out-of-school is yielding uneven progress. Girls are still being married instead of being maintained in school. For example, out of 10,000 children and adolescents of school ages targeted, only 2,120 (21 per cent girls) were able to go back to school at the beginning of the ongoing school year. Likely, out of 1,500 preschool and primary school teachers targeted, only 615 (234 female) were effectively supervised. The pupils are enjoying better preschool and primary teachings due to the competences acquired. 

In the northern vulnerable regions, UNICEF country programme could not meet the objective of providing potable water to communities, health centres and schools. Rather than the 1 per cent increase planned this year, access to safe drinking water increased by 0.3 per cent because of insufficient financial resources and limited technical and logistic capacity of construction companies. Likely, construction of small-scale water networks was delayed due to the lengthy delivery of the solar powered pumps. 

One strategy selected is the humanitarian–development continuum through system strengthening, changes in socio-cultural practices and beliefs regarding children’s well-being. This was challenged by geographical and programmatic constraints. Most of the funds received for emergency responses were either geographically or thematically tagged. Multiplying effects envisioned between the two could therefore not be operationalized to the full. However, KfW funds allocated to fight against malnutrition have permitted to implement both development and emergency response interventions. 

Lessons 
It is important to capitalize on lessons learned related to community engagement, operationalization of humanitarian–development continuum, engagement with partners, cholera response and protection of children associated with armed groups. 

1) Community engagement permitted dialogue and participation of vulnerable people. Horizontal dialogue with actors who operate at grassroots level were setup. Thirty community platforms permitted adolescents to participate in social dialogue in the East and Adamawa regions. Actions implemented by these platforms have permitted people from Bororo and Baka minorities to increase the demand for social services.  

Community support groups were set-up to improve community partnership and participation in emergency response activities. The same platforms streamline intergenerational dialogue and circulate information. Actors in the field show willingness and commitment to use the platforms to activate voluntarism, to help communities engage in solving their problems. In the Lake Chad Basin, more than 1.3 million persons were reached with messages on cholera prevention and treatment, specifically targeting pupils, students, school teachers, traditional healers, leaders and journalists. Additionally, in both sensitization emphasized peacebuilding, social cohesion and peaceful cohabitation between all groups dwelling in affected/at-risk localities. In line with this, islanders and nomadic groups were served and directly involved in the implementation of the communication strategy during polio response in Lake Chad Basin. 

2) Decentralization is an opportunity to “seize and deliver” for the most disadvantaged children and communities. Since considerable socio-cultural differences exist in the country, decentralization, if appropriately implemented, can permit a relevant response to local development issues and increase populations’ ownership and participation and thus accelerate the realization of children rights. Government engagement to accelerate decentralization is an opportunity to enlarge geographical scale and increase capacity to respond to people’s and community’s needs. UNICEF Cameroon partners with recently-created ministry in charge of local development and the community development programme. In the Far-north region, the country programme works with traditional/community rulers, chiefdoms and religious leaders on how to collaborate effectively to address issues such as weak performance in immunization, birth registration and appropriate care/feeding of children to combat stunting. Communes can contribute to advance children’s rights, and are potential partners who can provide local financial resources for children. 

3) Persistence of the crises that necessitate the humanitarian-development continuum: In addition to the four regions (East, Adamawa, North, Far-north) initially targeted, the programme extended interventions to the North-west and South-west regions because of the prevailing conflict. Utilization of funds allocated by KfW to nutrition is an example of operating the humanitarian–development continuum. Joint programmes on resilience in the Far-north and East regions will support humanitarian – development continuum effectiveness.

4) Involving education authorities at central and decentralized levels in emergency coordination mechanisms facilitates linkages between emergency response and development interventions. High-level advocacy and fluent information circulation between all actors strengthened Government ownership and led to integration of temporary learning and protective spaces used for Central African Republic refugee children in the Adamawa and East regions into formal education system. 

5) Leveraging with development actors is important to deliver results for children. Mindful of its financial, technical and inducing capacity, UNICEF Cameroon developed partnerships with priority to immunization, combatting stunting and birth registration to all children notably those living in the most vulnerable regions. UNICEF is leading technical working groups with partners who are active in the sectors. In birth registration, a technical multi-actor platform is fully operational. Bearing multiple benefits, the group gathers the National Bureau of Civil Status, the European Union commission in Cameroon, the GIZ, United Nations Development Programme and UNHCR. UNICEF can technically support, leverage financial resources and extend interventions to the whole national territory and therefore give an opportunity to many children to enjoy their basic rights. UNICEF ensured leadership role in the formulation of the joint United Nations Programme on resilience as well as chaired United Nations Development Assistance Framework 4 on resilience. Likewise, as grant agent of Emergency Fund from the Global Partnership for Education, the Education Cluster lead and co-lead of United Nations Development Assistance Framework pillar 3, UNICEF Cameroon coordinated the development of the financial proposal for education in emergency to reinforce the response to the protracted Central African Republic crisis. 

6) Harnessing the power of working together with all stakeholders at all levels produces large-scale changes. Cameroon is a middle-income economy with appreciable public resources. Official development aid does not exceed five per cent of the national budget. In such a context, UNICEF is leading public expenditure-tracking surveys in nutrition, WASH, education and health sectors. Moreover, disparities between ‘best-off’ and ‘worst-off’ have prevailed so long that they are hardly perceived as issues and require appropriate and immediate response. Partnering is critical to achieve meaningful and sustainable change. Bringing all actors together creates momentum to favor large scale changes that will impact beyond United Nations priority zones in the country. UNICEF, United Nations Development Programme, European Union, GIZ and National Bureau of Civil Status partnership to revamp birth registration is a good example of such collaboration. 

7) Youth participation and engagement are important to achieve results for children. As close to half of the population is under 18 years old, investing in youth is critical to safeguard progress and for return in investment in social sectors. The U-Report initiative covered landmarks with the creation of a toll-free phone line dedicated to youth information on their rights, availability and reference to existing services. This is one of the instruments used by the country programme to achieve goals of the 90-90-90 initiative of a world free of HIV/AIDS. This platform is used to promote communication between the population and public affairs managers in sectors of the country programme. The momentum created by the U-Report initiative mobilized the youth on the millennium agenda and reemphasized the importance of their role in achieving Sustainable Development Goals in Cameroon. Involving children as agents of change will be strengthened. Priority will be given to education, employment initiatives through involvement of youths in WASH construction, education infrastructures, development of innovations and support to youths’ incubators. 

8) Delays in implementing decisions and commitments made by Government are negatively affecting the programme-enabling environment and child rights. Programme investments in the enabling environment have failed to produce expected changes because of protracted delays of endorsements within the administrative chains. Some important child rights issues are not receiving appropriate address because of delayed development policies and strategies endorsement by authorized institutions/officials. The Government drafted a protocol recommending quick release of children associated with armed groups in line with international standards ratified by Cameroon, for example, but no endorsement has occurred so far. Therefore, children are still detained. Likewise, Government failure to ensure continuity of cholera surveillance mechanisms and water provision to vulnerable at-risk populations resulted in cholera outbreak in 2018. UNICEF Cameroon’s contribution was critical for crisis response. 

Within the framework of results for children in West and Central African Region, the UNICEF Cameroon country office will strive to achieve change for children in the goal areas of the organizational strategic plan, including: 

1. Extend solar-powered cold chain to increase vaccine coverage with emphasis in the low performing districts; 
2. Maintain the country free from polio virus circulation; eliminate neonatal tetanus and move toward measles and rubella elimination; 
3. Reinforce community mobilization to increase demand of education in both humanitarian and development settings; 
4. Scale-up interventions against stunting and other forms of malnutrition, taking full advantage of opportunities offered by the ‘first 1,000-days’ window and using a life-cycle approach: emphasis will be on improving infant and young child feeding practices and maternal nutrition at grassroot level. Cross-sector collaboration to enable closer ties between nutrition and sensitive sectors such as health, water and sanitation, food security, social protection and early childhood development will be continued and strengthened. 
5. Extension of inter-operability between civil status and health system to additional communes of programme priority zones and promotion of large-scale response to all forms of violence that are affecting children notably girls; 
6. Continued advocacy for the signing of the protocol for children affected by armed conflict release and the establishment of a disarmament, demobilization and reintegration  mechanism of children that is in line with international standards;
7. Strengthen technical and managerial capacities of municipalities and decentralized communities for sustainable delivery of WASH services and professionalization of water systems management; 
8. Promote and reinforce public private partnership for the development of WASH infrastructures; 
9. Implement community-led total sanitation with integration of community interventions (WASH, health, nutrition, education, and HIV/AIDS);
10. Advocate for adequate budgetary allocation to social services based on evidence generated from Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys being done in four sectors;
11. Implement resilience reinforcement joint programmes in Far-north and East regions. 

Cross-sectoral components of the UNICEF Cameroon country programme will provide support on people’s and community engagement to remove systemic and socio-cultural bottlenecks in programme focus areas. Communication for development will reinforce evidence generation and utilization to facilitate removal of bottlenecks that block people’s utilization of basic social services and to adopt essential family practices by families who live in underserved regions in Cameroon. 




"
WCAR,Sao Tome & Principe,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
As important achievements were registered in the areas of policy development and legislation, moving forward UNICEF Sao Tome and Principe will next focus on achieving greater balance between its work at the policy level and at the community level, through service delivery. Programmatic visits and interactions with partners show the need for UNICEF to invest in modelling evidence-based solutions to support policy implementation at a larger scale. 

Despite intensive capacity building at the institutional level, insufficient national ownership and structural financial/logistical constraints sometimes affect UNICEF’s ability to regularly monitor the situation of children and women in the country. In the coming year, it will be important for the office to accelerate its support for improved monitoring systems and reconnect decision making levels with vulnerable communities, ensuring that key legislative and policy improvements achieved by the country in 2018 are translated into improvements in the lives of the most vulnerable children.

The 2017 and 2018 experiences with South-South collaboration showed the importance of widening the scope of horizontal collaboration to non-Portuguese speaking countries to respond to programmatic needs, especially in the areas of early pregnancy and out-of-school children. In order to address the need for Portuguese-speaking experts, UNICEF continued to advocate within the UN system for the development of a roster of specialists across areas relevant to the UNDAF.

In past years, UNICEF Sao Tome and Principe used traditional C4D strategies (such as campaigns, sensitization activities, mobilization through the media) to encourage behaviour change across programmes and specifically in the areas of preventing violence against children and promoting life skills, parental education and nutrition. One of the most important challenges relates to the capacity to evaluate the impact of these activities in the longer term, and to shift from assessing knowledge to confirming actual behaviour change. The barriers to behaviour change are common across programmes and include gender discrimination, socio-economic conditions and limited access to services.

Additionally, the pace at which the organization transitions to a digital workplace and the use of technology-based innovation to support programmes represents an opportunity – but also a challenge for a small office like UNICEF Sao Tome e Principe. Linguistic and technical constraints require an approach capable of strengthening internal and external capacities to creatively use innovation and support evidence-based practices. To tackle these challenges in 2019, UNICEF will count on organizational assets and skills to build capacities on C4D, both internally and externally. UNICEF WCARO support will be needed to identify strategies to boost community engagement across sectors. Additionally, the office will strengthen its innovation for social change portfolio through the recruitment of a dedicated technology for development staff.

In 2018 the country office successfully achieved KRC 1 related to immunization. The changing environment characterized by the gradual exit of GAVI and adherence to the vaccine independence initiative may hamper the results achieved to date. In close collaboration with UNICEF’s Supply Division and UNICEF WCARO, UNICEF Sao Tome and Principe will need to continue anticipating shortfalls and leveraging additional support to national counterparts for a smooth transition to vaccine independence. In 2019, the country will no longer be eligible for vitamin A supply in-kind donations, but UNICEF is confident the Government is ready and willing to take on the responsibility for procurement, to ensure sustainability. Additionally, lack of financial support for the collection of biometric data will prevent UNICEF from measuring impact on anaemia reduction in the framework of MICS6. While UNICEF already contributes to the procurement of iron and folic acid for pregnant women, in 2019 it will work closely with UNICEF WCARO to identify strategies for addressing iron-deficiency anaemia in women of reproductive age, with a focus on adolescent girls.

While the Sao Tome and Principe office is not among the champions for regional KRCs related to violence and open defecation, it benefits from exchanges and learning within the region as these remains important priority areas where UNICEF needs to make a difference. Conversely, the excellent achievements of the country in the area of birth registration could inspire other countries to achieve the relevant KRC.

Progress and results achieved throughout 2018 confirmed UNICEF as the leading organization for the promotion of children’s rights in Sao Tome and Principe. Nevertheless, the office sometimes experienced a lack of solid partnerships with civil society and faced the challenge that there were only a few partner organizations advocating and delivering services for children’s rights locally. In 2019 strategic partnership development will need to span from community organizations to private sector to academia and beyond. UNICEF has a strong reputation in the country and a demonstrated capacity to leverage resources and engagement. In 2019 it will accelerate efforts to engage additional local partners in major advocacy activities.

External communication activities allowed UNICEF to voice important messages on children’s rights. The people of Sao Tome e Principe are traditionally responsive and mobilize for children’s rights, both during the national month of children in June and on the 20th of November. Activities organized by UNICEF for World Children’s Day in 2018 confirmed the great leveraging power of these special events. Schools, private sector entities and national institutions responded to UNICEF’s appeal to engage, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child anniversary did not pass unseen. The coming year will mark 30 years since the adoption of the Convention of the Rights of the Child, offering UNICEF an opportunity to make children’s voices heard at the national level throughout the 12 months and to engage in sustainable partnerships with local actors.

UNICEF’s programme structure is conducive to cross-sectoral work, especially in the areas of adolescents and parenting education. A challenge is posed by segmented structures and accountabilities among national partners. The new UNICEF strategic plan and the SDG framework are important instruments for advocacy and planning for increased cross-sectoral collaboration across the life cycle, with a special focus on the first 1,000 days and the young people’s agenda.

To measure the impact of its actions and those of the Government on the lives of children, UNICEF Sao Tome and Principe must work around one major obstacle: the lack of timely and comprehensive data. It is believed that this will be remedied with the launch of the MICS in 2019, which will help show what the country has achieved for children in the last decade and where extra effort is required. 

Finally, in the framework of UN coherence, the first year of implementation of joint plans was rich in lessons learned. Above all, the need for more frequent dialogue among agencies on progress and perspectives, beyond the mid-year and end of the year reviews. Increased frequency will allow for improved analysis of cooperation opportunities and a stronger appreciation of results against the UNDAF. UNICEF has a key role to play as leader of the social cohesion group, which accounts for the greatest number of programme components and partners, and as leader of the communication group. Going forward, UNICEF Sao Tome and Principe considers UN Reform as an opportunity to further strengthen children’s rights in the United Nations narrative and action.

WCAR,Senegal,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Lessons learned

UNICEF initiated a high-level meeting on children, adolescents and young people to ensure that the second phase of the National Development Plan had a strong child-focused perspective. The voices of young people during the critical advocacy phase had a strong effect and reached the hearts of decision-makers. A common position emerged from the discussions on the need for a strategic shift, by adopting a life-cycle approach in policy formulation for children, adolescents and young people to reduce inequality and to capture the demographic dividend.

U-Report is a UNICEF tool that has yet to sufficiently demonstrate its full potential in terms of attractiveness to young people (45,490 youth reached against a target of 60,000 for 2018, or 76 per cent of the target) and its added value and impact of young people’s voice in terms of socio-political changes at national and local levels. 

The major concerns by U-Report users were the platform’s weak capacity for interaction, lack of availability of qualitative information of interest to young people and the lack of youth voices actually being heard by decision makers. Social Change Factory and UNICEF decided on an innovative approach through which polls were preceded by online debates, radio broadcasts and school visits around the chosen theme to create interest among young people. This increased the participation rate in polls and the number of U-Reporters, which indicated that using stand-alone polls, as U-Report is currently designed, is not an efficient strategy to engage young people significantly. UNICEF Senegal and Social Change Factory will review and redefine the U-Report strategy, to build a bridge to decisions makers and to inspire youth engagement and participation through this digital platform. Mechanisms of engaging decision makers to consider the voice of young people need broader consultation and strategic approaches.

Another initiative in collaboration with Social Change Factory, as part of Voices of Youth, involves ""project solutions"" that young people implement to address problems in their communities. This was innovative in that Voices of Youth moved from a simple platform for expression to a space for development, that is generating enthusiasm among young people and sensitizing communities to their potential to bring about change. UNICEF Senegal should build on the success of “project solutions” with Social Change Factory to reinforce young people’s involvement through school government andmunicipalities, for example, and help them to then empower other young people.

In the area of technology for development, UNICEF continued to support the Ministry of Health in scaling-up and expanding the mInfosanté platform. This real-time data-monitoring platform, based on open-sourced RapidPro technology, was originally conceived in Senegal as a tool for epidemiological surveillance but also allows coordination in health emergencies and supports local health-management functions (including search for ambulances) and interactions between health managers and service providers, primarily using SMS.  

With funding from United Nations Development Operations Coordination Office, UNICEF collaborated with that office, the World Health Organisation and Food and Agriculture Organisationto support the Government to expand mInfosanté for community-based surveillance to include monitoring zoonosis and improveddashboard reporting features, and to host the RapidPro platform locally within the Ministry of Health and at the government information technology agency. In 2018, coordination issues between the two bodies, since resolved, confirmed the importance of government leadership, interest and capacity in driving initiatives. Scale-up of mIinfoSanté, as agreed by the Ministry of Health, will require significant additional effort and resources in 2019, including technical assistance, in coordination with the ministry and partners, under government leadership. 

In the area of child protection, in a national context where business processes for case management are not yet standardized enough to introduce a tool like PRIMERO, RapidPro was piloted in one district to ensure child protection case monitoring, particularly cases of violence against children. Initially perceived as a means to collect data on child protection cases, the participatory approach led to a shift in the tool’s design and purpose. The system was redesigned to respond to locally-expressed needs to connect communities to social welfare service providers to report child protection cases and ensure rapid response from services; and ensure real-time incident monitoring.  

The pilot underlined the importance of complying with national regulation on personal data protection. The participatory and open approach ensured the usefulness, adequacy and ownership of the tool by users on the ground, resulting in strengthened commitments and collaboration between communities and services with a more effective and appropriate referral and rapid response to children, an increase in the number of children in need of special protection reported to services and real-time data monitoring. The pilot showed the importance of a “small step” approach when designing a monitoring tool that is easy to manage and useful to users. The system enabled a quick start for real-time data monitoring with low investment. The system is operational in one district and replication is underway in other districts.

The reactivation of the early childhood development taskforce strengthened a multisectoral approach in the country office and partners. With UNICEF advocacy with institutional stakeholders, 16 essential family practices in health, nutrition, protection, and early stimulation were articulated and validated. The adoption of essential family practices is a step towards an integrated early childhood development system. The integrated approach of ministries reinforced early childhood development as a national priority, especially for sectors like health, and the coherence and coordination of interventions. In the new country programme, UNICEF Senegal should support integrated and synergistic approaches to early childhood development. 

UNICEF Senegal leveraged different community-based approaches to generate community dialogue, build community capacities and drive behavioural and normative change. The participatory approach was means for integrated development and social change. An experience in Tambacounda revealed that communities understand the need to improve the nutritional status and survival of their children when communities highlighted education and child protection in their new priority plan. A participatory approach can also create a new community dynamic and promote local development. The approach will be expanded in 2019 on the assumption that it will be modelled or fully integrated in national programmes.

To improve multi- and inter-sector programme components, UNICEF Senegal conducted a cross-sectoral review and decentralized planning exercise. The workshop allowed the country office to experiment and develop an innovative methodology of multi/intersectoral planning that entails establishing cross-sectoral analytical tools, using “sectoral and geographical gateway points”, adopting a life-cycle approach, focusing on the Key Results for Children and mobilizing actors represented in each work group.  

Apart from methodological exploration, the exercise developed a model for executing interventions in the field in terms of programmatic synergy, life-cycle approach and mobilization of local and government partners, communities, United Nations agencies, non-government organizations, with a focus on the Key Results for Children. Programmatic points were identified at the sector level (health, education), geographic level (local child-friendly authority) and community level (committees) as catalysts for sector complementarity and convergence. Intervention areas relevant to each age group (early childhood, school age, adolescence) were identified by state services, non-government organizations, local authorities and communities who participated in the exercises. The outcome will guide future programmatic action.

The visit of the UNICEF Regional Director to Senegal was an opportunity to reflect on and draw lessons from the implementation of the country programme. A lesson learned was the successful multisectoral interventions implemented in the regions of convergence in Casamance and the peri-urban area of Dakar, such as convergence of civil registry operations with the health sector; the inclusion of vitamin A distribution in routine immunization services; community-based nutrition interventions like flour-enriching organized by women’s literacy classes; the integration of an innovative, low-cost mechanism for handwashing with soap (“tippy-tap”) and menstrual hygiene management interventions through the community-led total sanitation approach.  

The second lesson learned was the importance of the system-strengthening strategy in child protection, based on the district-level coordination committee led by the main state authorities. This proved that with support, decentralized authorities develop, monitor and evaluate multisectoral interventions to protect the most vulnerable children from violence and abuse. A recommendation was to coordinate actions at the governorate level to scale up interventions in all districts of targeted regions. 

Investments in strengthening partnerships and coordination with the Government and development partners allowed UNICEF Senegal to leverage commitments and resources for children, and generate momentum for promising initiatives and strategies. UNICEF Senegal’s advocacy, based on recent evidence on out-of-school children, resulted in prioritizing out-of-school children in the new Education Sector Plan, and in commitments by development partners to support the Governmentin scaling up the second-chance education interventions piloted with UNICEF support since 2017. UNICEF will strengthen and expand these partnerships in 2019. In particular, efforts at municipal level must be intensified to improve service delivery and reach the most marginalized children, especially out-of-school children and adolescents. 

Constraints

To address malnutrition, there was a need to secure the allocation of domestic funding for ready-to-use therapeutic food and other essential supplies for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition. Although Senegal is no longer on the Humanitarian Response Plan to qualify for international humanitarian funding assistance, several regions in the country remain vulnerable for severe acute malnutrition every year. There is a risk of children dying from severe acute malnutrition if the Government and partners fail to mobilize resources. Advocacy is ongoing to continue to sensitize the Government and nutrition partners, including non-emergency partners, on this issue.

Senegal's progress and encouraging results in recent years in health, nutrition and WASH were threatened by recurrent strikes of government health workers in 2018, which resulted in data not being made available, which in turn affected the efforts made to build a common information system around the DHIS2 to facilitate regular performance monitoring and timely decision-making. The cessation of vaccination and seasonal malaria chemoprophylaxis activities, among others, posed severe risks to the health of children in particular. The health worker strikes delayed the implementation of activities and adversely affected high level authorities. 

Following the legislative elections in mid-2017, changes in government structure were initiated, including the creation of a new Ministry of Good Governance and Child Protection. The changes, though offering renewed perspectives of leadership and partnerships, challenged implementation of the UNICEF programme of cooperation during the course of 2018, especially regarding policy, law and institutional reforms, particularly due to the time needed to clarify mandates and responsibilities across and within ministries, and the ensuing institutional capacities of counterparts. 

Despite efforts, limited progress was made in legal reform to align national legislation with international standards and conventions ratified by the Government. The sensitivity of some child rights and gender issues in the context of cultural norms; government institutional changes; and the preparation for presidential elections in 2019 were constraining factors. Nevertheless, the working process around the child code was relaunched in 2018 under the leadership of the Ministry of Justice, and the draft law was reviewed by experts based on official recommendations from the experts committee under the Prime Minister’s office. 

Beginning a new programme cycle in 2019, UNICEF Senegal is positioned to pursue its strategic direction in line with the new country programme document and the priorities of the Pan Senegal Emergent.

"
WCAR,Sierra Leone,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
UNICEF Sierra Leone documented lessons at four different levels: the country programme level, the programmatic level, how UNICEF positions itself, and behaviour change communications.

Country programme lessons
UNICEF Sierra Leone learned several important lessons during the 2018 preparation for the 2020-2023 country programme. The current country programme does not apply results-based management (RBM) approaches effectively, making it challenging to track results through a measurement framework. This has resulted in UNICEF not being able to clearly determine the contribution made towards a higher result that many others were also contributing towards. It also resulted in hierarchical concerns with the Outputs, many of which were crafted at a level well above what UNICEF and its direct partners could be held accountable for. As a result of this lesson, the design process for the 2020-2023 country programme design commenced with situation analysis, programme assessments and deprivation prioritisations, which led to causality analyses, development of theories of change and then the identification of the specific ‘changes’ where UNICEF would act. Based on this standard RBM planning approach, results frameworks are being drafted.

The process for development of causality analyses and theories of change for the 2020-2023 country programme clearly identified shortcomings in the availability of fiscal and budgetary analyses in the social sectors, as well as limited use of systematic operational research methodologies for pilots/models to support the scaling up. An additional lesson identified during the programme assessment and preparation of programme strategy concept notes for the Strategic Moment of Reflection was that individual programme geographic coverage was largely opportunistic rather than strategic. UNICEF Sierra Leone will develop an evidence-based geographic targeting plan for the 2020-2023 country programme. 

Programmatic lessons
Child protection
In 2016, the Government changed the authority responsible for birth registration from within the MoHS to the NCRA. UNICEF understands lessons from global best practice that the interoperability between birth registration systems and health systems will ensure improved rates of, and increased access to, birth registration at the community level. In response to this lesson, UNICEF advocated to ensure that the NCRA’s strategy includes retention of birth registration services in health facilities. To formalize this, UNICEF worked with the NCRA and MoHS to develop a memorandum of understanding, which was signed in October 2018 between the two entities, to ensure their ongoing collaboration and to ensure that the increase in birth registration continues. This improved cooperation will ensure that the Government maintains its upward trajectory in achieving the KRC7 target.

A number of challenges have been experienced by UNICEF in coordinating with NGO partners and ensuring that they adhere to the programme strategy. To better understand some of these issues, with the intention of acting upon the lessons learned, UNICEF undertook an assessment of its child protection implementing partners to assess their capacity, alignment to vision, and ability to achieve the programmatic goals and objectives. The findings of the assessment will guide future programme partnership modalities and strategies.

Health
The four special baby care units established at tertiary and regional hospitals with UNICEF support have been recognized as the state-of-the-art facilities for managing sick newborns in the country. UNICEF’s support to creating an enabling environment for service providers included providing equipment, instrument and commodities, and ensuring that the MoHS conducted regular monitoring and quarterly joint review meetings. Strong leadership and ownership shown by high level government officials and hospital management was also critical and has led to increased commitment and positive attitudes of staff working in the units. UNICEF’s analysis of, and response to the needs assessment findings were critical to the success of establishing the SBCUs. 

Following their outstanding performance, the SBCUs received positive attention from the senior government officials, including the President and Minister of Health and Sanitation, and UNICEF was requested to support its nationwide scale-up. UNICEF will apply lessons learned from the first four units to supporting the Government’s scale up.

Repeated stock out of essential drugs and commodities were the major bottlenecks in effective health service delivery. Many factors contributed to the stock out situations, ranging from delays in procurement processes (including custom clearances due to policy changes), to delays in distribution processes, and an absence of storage capacity and associated system strengthening. To overcome these challenges, UNICEF took the following actions: 
Capacity building of Directorate of Drugs and Medical Supplies (DDMS). The DDMS is acting as an interim body to handle the storage and distribution of drugs and medical supplies until the National Medical Supplies Agency (NMSA) becomes fully operational. The capacity building included the DDMS staff visiting to UNICEF Supply Division in Copenhagen to improve their understanding about procurement processes. 

Continuous negotiation and advocacy with the Government to expedite the custom clearance process. This followed the issuance of a Presidential Executive Order in April 2018, which banned all tax and duty waivers for non-diplomatic imports. UNICEF also negotiated discounts with shipping lines and port authorities to minimize unexpected demurrage as a result of delayed clearance. 

Following the phasing out of the agency that had been responsible for storage, quarterly distribution and capacity building of Government in December 2017, UNICEF temporarily supported DDMS with the distribution of FHC drugs and commodities on an ad-hoc basis. 

While it is known that quality and coverage of the integrated community case management service depends on the continuous availability of drugs and supplies at the community health worker level, the assumption that periphery health units will distribute 30 per cent of first line antibiotics, ORS-zinc, malaria rapid test kits, and ACT drugs, was not always the case. This was mainly due to lack of commitment and accountability at district and PHU levels. This was a reminder that integrating community health approaches into health systems with strong linkages between PHUs and CHWs is critical in the successful roll out of iCCM services and achievement of universal primary healthcare in the country.To address this constraint, UNICEF engaged with the district health management teams and CHW Hub of the MoHS to pre-pack the medicines and distribute through the PHUs to the community health workers, a strategy which worked well in some districts.

WASH
UNICEF, in collaboration with the Government, has been implementing the Bilateral Sustainability Compact actions signed in 2013. Among the actions, the Government is expected to be fully responsible for monitoring the quality of WASH infrastructure construction, the management of community water sources, and behaviour change. While UNICEF provided institutional and technical support as envisioned in the Compact, it was learnt that some technical aspects related to the operation, maintenance, and financial responsibilities were often beyond the capacity of the decentralized government and the communities. However, recent sustainability checks conducted in two districts in 2018 demonstrated positive developments towards achieving sustainability. 

Despite the challenges and variation in the capacities at the local level, the Government has demonstrated an increased interest in implementing the Compact actions. The Government is considering rolling out sustainability checks beyond the two pilot districts, as UNICEF continues strengthening institutional capacities. UNICEF continued lobbying the Government for increased funding to support the devolved authorities to establish systems to support the operation and maintenance of WASH infrastructures and sustain changes in behaviours. The lesson learned is that meaningful implementation of Compact actions, coupled with systematic sustainability checks, contributed to the sustainability of WASH services and motivated the Government to assume greater responsibility. 

UNICEF focused on involving communities in the planning, implementation and overall decision-making process for water, sanitation and hygiene initiatives, and linked projects to Village Development Committees. Through these working arrangements, the communities, including local leadership and volunteers, have demonstrated increased ownership over, and motivation to maintain, their WASH infrastructures.It also encouraged the continued use of safe hygiene practices. UNICEF will continue working with its implementing partners and support other sector stakeholders to encourage use of community engagement approaches to increase functionality of WASH infrastructures and reduce the relapse to open defecation. 

UNICEF’s positioning
UNICEF has experienced the value of positioning itself to align with Government priorities in 2018, and was able to capitalize on early engagement.

UNICEF leveraged its position as a trusted and respected lead partner in the education sector, as highlighted by the Government’s designation of UNICEF as the GPE Grant Agent.  

UNICEF Sierra Leone learnt that accessing and using internal expertise can be a powerful tool for positioning, driving innovation, and developing partnerships. In November, the office hosted a mission from a data science team from UNICEF HQ. The mission resulted in a roadmap for 2019 between DSTI, UNICEF Sierra Leone and HQ’s Office of Innovation. Early positioning enabled UNICEF to present to the President and Minister of Education a ‘beta’ version of a visualisation tool for optimisation of education investment. This new model in Sierra Leone has potential to generate wide-ranging insight and learning for the entire organisation, particularly given UNICEF’s Strategic Plan’s focus on investing in innovation and ‘building broader, bolder partnerships that help us reach every child.’ UNICEF has developed a strong partnership with the DSTI with substantial work planned out for 2019.

Under the previous Government, the MSWGCA did not adopt and use Primero effectively, with the lack of investment of human or financial resources into the system resulting in its stagnation. Learning from this, UNICEF has advocated for Primero to be at the core of the case management process under the new Government and invested in its strengthening and expansion at an early stage. UNICEF provided refresher training to existing users, and on-the-job support and assistance to case workers.

UNICEF reinforced learning that effective positioning both with the new Government and with donors in 2018 helped in accessing funds and achieving programme outcomes. UNICEF and ILO sponsored the Minister for Labour and Social Security and the Commissioner of NaCSA to attend Social Security training at ILO’s International Training Centrein Turin, Italy. The purpose of the training was to increase executive-level commitment and quality decision-making on social protection issues in Sierra Leone. The Minister has reflected this increase in support for social protection verbally both during workshops and at the inter-agency forum.

Behavioural change
UNICEF saw increased level of recognition in coordinating office-wide behavioural change work, but challenges in targeting behaviours remain.There has been limited understanding of socio-cultural beliefs, customs and practices for a wide range of behaviours, including infant and young child feeding practices, child marriage, and open defecation. This has led to programming that is not evidence-informed, and ultimately not effective.

Through the Global Programme to Accelerate Action to End Child Marriage, UNICEF and UNFPA commenced work on a joint study of formative knowledge, attitudes and practices on child marriage. This aims to ensure both agencies are working from the same knowledge base and understanding of the situation, and are able to garner the full support of Government counterparts to be on board with the Programme. The late-2018 launch of the five-year National Strategy for the Reduction of Adolescent Pregnancy and Child Marriage will harmonize strategies and processes more thoroughly.

UNICEF supported the Government in intensifying nutrition counselling services in targeted districts. However, the Government does not have a systematic monitoring mechanism with standardized tools to track infant and young child feeding practices. The Government also does not have a harmonized social behaviour change communication strategy and plan. UNICEF will conduct qualitative research to fill these knowledge gaps and to inform the design of a strategy  in 2019. 

Working through the central executive committee of the Inter-Religious Council and district coordinators network galvanized religious leaders across the country to advocate and build partnerships for social and behaviour change. In addition to their proven ability to promote essential family behaviours, their position to challenge social norms and pledge against child marriage is a significant step towards the reduction of the practice.

WCAR,Togo,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Au cours du programme écoulé, le travail intersectoriel, le renforcement des systèmes et l’engagement communautaire ont soutenu l’atteinte des résultats planifiés et plus particulièrement : i) la production et utilisation des évidences en tant que moteur de changement pour les enfants ; ii) le passage à l’échelle pour l’obtention des résultats de grande ampleur ; iii) le travail avec les autres agences des Nations Unies ; iv) la programmation pour la mise à l’échelle des résultats. 

L’analyse des résultats des enquêtes MICS 2010 et 2017 montre que la réduction du taux de mortalité infanto-juvénile dans les régions d’intervention de l’Unicef ( Kara et savanes) est plus importante que celle dans les autres régions du pays (région des Plateaux et Région Maritime) : entre 2010 et 2017, cette réduction est de 49 % dans la région de Kara ( passant de 167 à 85 pour mille et elle est de 43 % dans la région des savanes (passant de 144 à 82 pour mille) alors qu’elle n’est que 13 % dans la région maritime (passant de 102 à 89 pour mille) et de 41% dans la région des plateaux (passant de 113 à 66 pour mille).
Ces résultats ont été atteints grâce à la mise en œuvre de stratégies efficaces basées sur des interventions à base communautaire et des paquets d’interventions à haut impact. Il s’agit essentiellement de la promotion des PFE et la prise en charge des maladies meurtrières de l’enfance par les ASC et l’ATPC (régression des cas de diarrhée pris en charge par les ASC due à l’introduction du vaccin contre le Rotavirus, à l’intensification des causeries éducatives sur les PFE et à la mise en œuvre de l’ATPC dans 2 régions).
Ces stratégies ont été adoptées par le gouvernement et les autres partenaires et sont en train d’être mis à l’échelle du pays. Le nouveau programme de coopération 2019-2023 consolidera les acquis et assurera l’extension des interventions dans les régions d’interventions de l’Unicef, tout en continuant le plaidoyer pour le passage à l’échelle dans les autres régions. Il est important de noter que les ASC jouent également un rôle important dans la promotion de la vaccination de routine et dans la supplémentation en Vitamine en A, notamment lors des JSE, qui contribuent à l’atteinte des résultats ciblées pour le KRC 1 (immunisation plus) et 2 (prévention de la malnutrition chronique). Le renforcement de la responsabilisation de la communauté elle-même en cours assurera la pérennité de toutes ces initiatives communautaires.

La disponibilité permanente des intrants constitue une condition essentielle à la réussite de la mise en œuvre des interventions à base communautaire, mais également pour l’attente des objectifs fixés pour le KRC 1. Malgré, l’appui de différents partenaires à l’achat d’intrants, les ruptures d’intrants sont souvent liées à la complexité de la chaine d’approvisionnement à tous les niveaux. Il importe donc de renforcer le système de gestion des approvisionnements du niveau central au niveau communautaire dans le cadre du nouveau programme 2019 - 2023. Par ailleurs, malgré les efforts du pays en matière d’allocation des ressources pour la mise en œuvre des interventions, la forte dépendance des IBC aux financements extérieurs ne favorise pas l’appropriation et le passage à l’échelle. Cependant en 2018, un sous-groupe santé communautaire des partenaires techniques et financiers présidé par UNICEF ouvre une bonne perspective pour la mise à l’échelle des IBC. En général, les interventions en faveur de la santé de l’enfant restent affectées par les insuffisances dans la gouvernance et dans le financement du secteur, l’insuffisance de ressources humaines qualifiées et le faible engagement communautaire.

Dans le domaine de l’éducation, l’insuffisance de ressources financières du secteur (destinées notamment au pilotage, aux investissements et aux sous-secteurs préscolaire et éducation non-formelle), l’insuffisance de Partenaires Techniques et Financier (encore trop peu nombreux au Togo pour le secteur de l’éducation et disposant souvent de ressources humaines limitées), la forte centralisation du secteur et les lenteurs administratives ont constitués des goulots récurrents à la mise en œuvre du programme. Les mouvements sociaux qui ont régulièrement secoué le pays et le secteur, la forte centralisation du secteur, la faiblesse des dispositifs de suivi (manque de ressources humaines et financières du ministère) et les croyances et normes socio-culturelles ont également impacté la mise en œuvre des activités et l’atteinte des résultats. L’analyse des forces et faiblesses (revue à mi-parcours 2016) a permis d’identifier les besoins en renforcement des interventions, entre autres dans le sens d’une plus grande appropriation (notamment au niveau inspections) et d’un suivi renforcé. La mise en œuvre de ces recommandations a été opérationnalisée en 2017 et a conduit entre autres à la révision des outils de soutien à la gouvernance participative, la mise en place d’un mécanisme révisé de coordination de l’approche EAE et une redéfinition profonde des rôles et responsabilités dans la mise en œuvre du modèle EAE. Une stratégie de sortie a également été mise en œuvre durant l’année 2018 et a permis non seulement la consolidation des acquis dans un total de 200 écoles EAE, mais également un transfert plus effectif des compétences au profit des équipes d’inspections en vue d’une mise en œuvre plus autonome des interventions. Au titre des leçons apprises et des ajustements réalisés, on observe l’importance de la production d’évidences stratégiques qui a permis d’assurer une plus grande efficience des actions de plaidoyer (notamment pédagogie active et éducation inclusive), le ren
forcement des dispositifs de Suivi-Evaluation du programme permettant son meilleur pilotage et l’adaptation des approches de mise en œuvre des expériences pilotes. Ceci pour assurer notamment un transfert de compétences plus effectif à la partie gouvernementale et permettre une amélioration de l’appropriation de ces expériences pilotes (concrétisées par la prise en main de certaines d’entre elles par les autorités déconcentrées sans interventions de partenaires externes, notamment l’éducation inclusive). Les dispositions ont été prises pour poursuivre et renforcer ces ajustements en 2019, qui vont également contribuer à l’attente des résultats ciblées pour le KRC 4 (qualité des apprentissage amélioré).


Concernant la protection, la convergence et intégration intersectorielle ont été fondamentales pour promouvoir et augmenter l’EN (KRC 7), contribuant ainsi à une meilleure protection holistique des filles/garçons. L’utilisation des agents de santé pour la mobilisation et l’identification des femmes enceintes, en collaboration avec les leaders communautaires, la disponibilité des services d’EN de proximité dans les formations sanitaires des régions du projet pilote de transfère monétaire et celui des cantines scolaires (gouvernement, Banque Mondiale et l’UNICEF-2014-2017) ont permis d’accroître la demande des services d’état civil par les populations, particulièrement les plus vulnérables.
Les ressources mises à disposition par le gouvernement sont toujours insuffisantes, notamment pour l’EN et l'amélioration de la qualité des services de protection. Cela représente une des contraintes majeures car une part importante des interventions est financée par des partenaires techniques et financiers. Pour renforcer la concertation multisectorielle au niveau national sur les questions de protection de l’enfance et pour influencer les actions au niveau local, l’appui aux cadres de concertation de protection National, Régional et Préfectoral est stratégique. Pour cela, les ministères impliqués doivent garantir la mise à disposition de données plus fiables pour les prises de décisions et leur utilisation dans le processus d’élaboration des rapports. En 2018, ces données étaient importantes pour la préparation de quatre rapports sur les engagements pris par le pays au niveau international en matière de protection de l’enfant. Cependant il y a un besoin de renforcement des capacités des intervenants dans la chaîne de collecte de données. 
Les différents enjeux dans la prise en charge holistique des filles et garçons victimes de VAC par le système de justice, y compris le mariage d’enfants, montrent : i) la nécessité pour l’UNICEF de continuer à prioriser une approche systémique de la protection ; ii) l’importance d’impliquer les filles et garçons en leur donnant un rôle et des responsabilités y compris dans le système informel de protection, en collaboration avec les leaders communautaires. Les barrières au niveau de la demande, parmi lesquelles on note le poids des croyances et valeurs traditionnelles, limitent considérablement l’accès des enfants vulnérables aux services d’état civil et favorisent la persistance de pratiques culturelles qui vont contre les droits des enfants. Elles représentent un goulot pour la prévention des VAC et la protection des filles et des garçons. L‘expérience du programme 2014-2018 a mis en évidence que la collaboration avec les leaders traditionnels et religieux pourrait potentiellement accélérer la promotion de changements importants, tels que l’abandon du mariage des enfants. L’UNICEF reste un partenaire clé dans l’ensemble de ces enjeux et soutient les efforts nationaux dans le renforcement du système de protection des enfants.

La mise en œuvre de l’approche de l’assainissement total piloté par la communauté à travers le partenariat avec 15 ONG, a permis aux communautés d’investir leurs ressources propres dans l’amélioration de leurs conditions d’hygiène et d’assainissement d’accroitre leur demande en latrines améliorées. De même, l’ancrage institutionnel et multisectoriel en place à tous les niveaux pour la coordination et le suivi constitue un levier important pour l’élimination de la défécation à l’air libre (KRC 8). Cette mobilisation multisectorielle génère au niveau communautaire la participation active des différents comités et des leaders aux actions collectives de construction et d’utilisation des latrines. En ce qui concerne l’approvisionnement en eau potable, le contrôle de la qualité de l’eau lors de la dernière enquête MICS6 2017, a montré que même si l’eau est de bonne qualité à la source, celle-ci se dégrade sur toute la chaine (du transport au stockage et à la consommation), d’où la nécessité de déployer des stratégies pour assurer la sécurité sanitaire de l’eau et aboutir à la consommation d’une eau gérée en toute sécurité dans le cycle programmatique 2019-2023. Le poids des normes sociales dans certaines communautés et les facteurs climatiques telle que les inondations, ainsi que la lourdeur du processus de décaissement de fonds pour les ONG en vue de la mise en œuvre des interventions, constituent des contraintes pour atteindre le statut de Fin de la Défécation à l’Air Libre, d’où la nécessité de renforcer la mise en œuvre systématique de trois piliers indissociables :(i) l’ATPC/ATPE, (ii) le Marketing de l’assainissement (iii) le mécanismes de financement endogènes. 

Dans le domaine des politiques sociales, le travail effectué avec les ministères des finances, planification, action sociale, santé, éducation, Assemblée nationale, société civile, a permis de créer un momentum autour du financement des secteurs sociaux. Il est nécessaire de continuer ledit travail en mettant sur pied une coalition (BM, FMI, UE, BIT, société civile, parlementaires) afin de pérenniser les acquis et de contribuer à l ’accroissement de façon substantielle la part du budget de l’Etat affectée aux secteurs sociaux. 
La collaboration avec le BIT, Union Européenne, BM lors de l’actualisation de la politique nationale de protection sociale devrait continuer pour parvenir à l’adoption de la politique ainsi qu’à sa mise en œuvre. De même, il est nécessaire d’appuyer le Gouvernement dans la coordination et l’ancrage institutionnel de la protection sociale, afin d’éviter un éparpillement des interventions et de parvenir à terme à la mise en place d’un système à l’intérieur du quels les différents mécanismes et outils de protection sociale communiquent et s’alimentent mutuellement. La création d’une masse critique d’acteurs disposant d’expertise sur la protection sociale et sur l’analyse de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle des enfants, spécialement des groupes vulnérables comme les enfants handicapés est nécessaire pour faire avancer l’agenda. Aussi, le renforcement des capacités des acteurs devra continuer à être utilisé comme stratégie majeure. En outre, en matière de planification sensible aux enfants, le travail devra se concentrer sur toute la chaîne planification-programmation-budgétisation-suivi évaluation plutôt qu’uniquement sur un des maillons pour permettre que la question des droits de l’enfant soit suffisamment prise en compte.

Les adolescents représentent une part importante de la population et doivent être des acteurs et des vecteurs des changements envisagés ainsi que de la mise en œuvre des ODD. Il sera important de travailler sur leur implication et leur prise en compte dans les politiques publiques ainsi que dans les mécanismes de redevabilité tant au niveau national que local.

Les réunions de coordination au niveau local ont permis une meilleure intégration et intersectorialité des programmes. Cependant la pérennisation de cette intégration ne peut être assurée que si le dispositif du Suivi-Evaluation est opérationnel au niveau local. Aussi sera-t-il nécessaire accompagner la pérennisation de ce dispositif en rapport avec le dispositif de suivi évaluation du PND et des ODD et le dispositif Institutionnel de coordination de suivi et de l’évaluation des politiques de développement (DIPD) qui prévoit des organes au niveau régional et local.

L’atteinte des résultats a été possible grâce aux alliances existantes avec les ministères sociaux, des Finances, de la Planification, l’Assemblée Nationale, l’Institut National de Statistique (INSEED), le partenariat avec les agences du système des Nations Unies (PNUD, l’OMS, l’UNFPA UNESCO, UNFPA, PAM, l’ONUSIDA, BIT), les partenaires bilatéraux et multilatéraux (AFD, GIZ, Fonds Mondial) et les institutions financières internationales (BM, Banque Africaine de Développement, Fond Monétaire Internationale). Les ONG nationales et internationales, les parlementaires, les chefs traditionnels, les leaders religieux, les communautés, les familles et les enfants continueront également à être des partenaires dans la conception et l’exécution des interventions. Les efforts du programme pour renforcer la synergie avec certains partenaires clés ont permis l’identification d’opportunités de collaboration opérationnelles pour le cycle 2019-2023.

La gestion effective et efficiente des ressources financières à travers une planification budgétaire efficiente, une attribution des couts opérationnels liés aux résultats et un suivi plus rapproché de l’utilisation des fonds, a facilité l’atteinte des résultats. De même que le maintien d’un climat et d’un environnement propices au développement du personnel, au travail d’équipe et à la redevabilité avec un équilibre entre la vie personnelle et professionnelle y ont grandement contribué.

Chaque année, l’élaboration du plan de travail avec les parties prenantes et du plan annuel de gestion avec l’équipe du bureau sont des occasions pour une analyse systématique des risques (crises socio politiques, inondations, épidémies, gestion inefficace des fonds, etc.) qui peuvent affecter l’exécution du programme, ainsi que pour le renforcement de la capacité du bureau et des partenaires à prévenir, atténuer, gérer le programme et répondre aux actions humanitaires.

La mise en œuvre du nouveau programme en 2019 se basera sur les éléments contenus et explicités dans la théorie de changement et l’analyse des risques. En outre, le bureau consolidera davantage les acquis tout en apportant des innovations telle que : (i) la mise à l’échelle de stratégies porteuses comme les IBC pour assurer la prise en charge des maladies infantiles; (ii) la mise à contribution du secteur privé à travers la responsabilité sociétale des entreprises (RSE) pour mobiliser des ressources en faveur des secteurs sociaux; iii) le renforcement des synergies et des partenariats avec d’autres intervenants.
