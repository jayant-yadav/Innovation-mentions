EAPR,Cambodia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Identification of vulnerable populations for purposes of targeting interventions remains difficult and was the case with identification of poor households and those with disabilities who were most vulnerable, and it was critical that they not miss receiving COVID vaccines. Due to its work across several sectors in this case with social protection and health sectors, UNICEF is in a unique position to create greater positive impact by ensuring cross-sectoral data analysis and action and increasing our partners’ alignment. UNICEF facilitated the use of data by the Government to identify IDPoor populations and PwD, thus improving targeting and outreach for COVID-19 vaccines. UNICEF also demonstrated its capabilities in SBC and T4D by working on important initiatives with the Government, such as the first digital immunization roadmap, digital learning platforms, and parenting tools based on human-centred design.

UNICEF provided technical support to MoEYS in formulating a national digital education strategy. The technical transformation brought about by the increased use of IT services and different digital solutions during the COVID-19 pandemic has provided opportunities to innovate, but there is a need to be cautious around what is technically achievable versus what is institutionally acceptable and feasible. It is crucial to establish a holistic vision and strategy first that will guide systematic and equitable introduction and expansion of effective digital education tools and solutions.

High level and consistent advocacy by UNICEF facilitated the total adoption of the CRC committee’s concluding observations by the Government with the aim of advancing children’s rights across sectors, while initiating discussions on legislative reforms on sensitive issues, such as corporal punishment, child trafficking, and online abuse. Adolescent and young people’s engagement through the Cambodia PROTECT campaign offered a promising practice to systematically engage young people in UNICEF programmes and provided lessons learned on the need to emphasise adolescents’ participation in all stages of programming and advocacy.

Leveraging financing is an urgent priority if the WASH sector is to achieve its targets. UNICEF can help de-risk investments, develop a pipeline of bankable projects and support Government and partners in climate-proofing WASH services. UNICEF is increasingly expected to play a stronger role in coordinating different sectoral workstreams under different line ministries, supporting more coherent approaches towards greater value for money in the sector’s investment.

Building a strong digitalized core system for cash transfer delivery enables rapid and efficient expansion of new national social protection programmes. Digitalisation, however, does not fully support the needs of vulnerable and hard-to-reach populations as community officials still need to be fully engaged. UNICEF will continue to build a system that focuses both on digital solutions and a stronger social service workforce, through advocacy and facilitation of inter-ministerial dialogue to expand community social protection/social service workforces.

Evaluations when carried out well have the scope to generate innovative strategies and leverage accountability and learning. The Climate Resilient WASH evaluation included a benchmark paper for the WASH sector in Cambodia, opening the space for agreeing on minimum standards on climate resilient services for Cambodia. The office undertook Social Protection evaluations, which were implemented jointly, in order to maximize learnings from each other as well as increase resource efficiency.

Cambodian companies are still in a nascent stage in their consideration and adoption of the sustainability agenda (including the SDGs), resulting in challenges when initiating collaborations or establishing a UN Global Compact Local Network. UNICEF has an opportunity to position itself as a lead agency promoting children’s rights among business communities to influence their business conducts and operations in a child friendly manner for priority programme results (e.g., child online protection, family friendly policy, etc.) through its Change Strategy.

Lessons from 2022 will continue to inform efforts to enhance programming interventions and new initiatives supported by UNICEF Country Office in order to optimize the results for children in Cambodia.

EAPR,China,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"It is important to demonstrate the effectiveness of UNICEF’s pilots to secure the government’s buy-in for scale-up. UNICEF also needs to generate convincing evidence and advocate for more efficient, effective, and equitable utilization of government fiscal resources for children.  This can be achieved by supporting government counterparts to seek more sustainable financing mechanisms for scaling up UNICEF’s high-impact interventions. For example, the evaluation on UNICEF’s IMCHD-ECD project included the evaluation criteria of sustainability in its design, looking at the project’s costing and possible approaches for scale-up. It was found that integrating the ECD service package into the country’s National Essential Public Health Service Package would only cost an additional 3.1 (labour cost only) to 4.8 (full cost) yuan per person per year. This has served as evidence for UNICEF to demonstrate the feasibility and affordability of the scale-up to key government stakeholders including NHC and MOF. 
 
Given that VAC is a sensitive issue to the government, the campaign on VAC, one of UNICEF’s advocacy priorities this year, was framed with a positive angle. Positive discipline and parenting were emphasized, with gender elements of promoting male caregivers’ engagement. This helped secure government counterparts’ support and provided opportunities for UNICEF to engage more stakeholders such as ICT companies to help amplify UNICEF’s messages and reach. 
 
As China experienced the third year of the pandemic, prolonged prevention and control measures on COVID-19 affected implementation of UNICEF’s workplan activities, including monitoring and provision of on-site technical support. UNICEF continued to take an adaptive approach to mitigate the risks and impacts of lockdowns and travel restrictions. Virtual meetings and training sessions have been widely used across UNICEF’s programmes. Many project field visits and supervisions were also switched to online modalities. Given previous experiences showing that virtual training is usually less effective, UNICEF emphasized participation, reflection, and assessment in virtual trainings, and used coaching to consolidate the training results for participants. However, we did not build in a formal comparison of the effectiveness of in-person versus online training, and this is an area to consider in the future.
 
Previous experiences had shown the value of child and adolescent participation in enriching UNICEF’s understanding on child-related issues and allowing the design of more effective and relevant interventions. In 2022, UNICEF continued to engage children and adolescents in its programmes and advocacy activities. For instance, UNICEF pretested campaign assets with adolescents to ensure these were responsive to their needs. UNICEF is exploring ways to institutionalize child and youth participation in programmes and beyond. The design of the Adolescent Mental Health Programme has pioneered an adolescent peer support system. UNICEF also consulted leaders of adolescent peer support networks to gather information on existing initiatives and practices and listened to their recommendations, which helped UNICEF in designing adolescent-friendly and adolescent-led peer support interventions in mental health. UNICEF is also supporting a policy study on child participation in the construction of CFC, which aims to inform the government’s technical guidelines in this area. 
 
Digitalization has also proven to be another effective strategy in expanding UNICEF programmes’ impact. For instance, the IYCF online training module was launched on the Health Family app, a mobile application developed by UNICEF in the previous programme cycle that has 780,000 users. This has significantly expanded the reach of IYCF messages while allowing the collection of real-time user feedback for programme monitoring.

EAPR,DP Republic of Korea,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Under the challenging operational circumstances, UNICEF maintained close dialogue with its resource partners in order to manage expectations, extend activity periods as well as re-programme funds to meet emerging challenges and address identified gaps. Moving forwards, a key challenge for 2023 will be covering the enormous funding gap for programme activities, given that no significant new contributions were received in 2022. UNICEF’s projected budget for 2023 is $23 million, of which US$ 17 million has yet to be secured. A concerted resource mobilization effort will be required to maintain critical life-saving programmes inside the DPRK and to ensure that progress made during the current country programme is maintained to the extent possible.

The complex supply operation in 2022 relied on creative and agile logistics management, for example by adjusting traditional freight processes such as the introduction of temperature-controlled containers to ensure integrity and quality of supplies that could be affected by uncertain timelines for quarantine and disinfection processes, and proactively engaging key players at all stages of the dynamic supply chain from manufacturers to the Government. A supply tracking tool developed by UNICEF DPRK has enhanced office’s ability to prioritize the importation of supplies based on product and grant expiration, which allowed for timely communication with relevant Ministries to better prioritize the allocation of wagons and vessels with respect to these criteria.

UNICEF devoted considerable attention to improving compliance with critical organizational processes and structures such as the Harmonised Approach to Cash Transfers, and the use of online structures for asset and contract management, which had been inconsistently applied since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. A series of training sessions and orientations for international and national seconded staff proved valuable in ensuring better understanding of processes and individual accountabilities.

In response to a Country Programme Evaluation recommendation to improve knowledge management, the office created a new online document management repository structure and continues to prioritize staff learning and development opportunities.

UNICEF worked closely with the Office of the UN Resident Coordinator and other UNCT members to find innovative solutions to the lack of an international banking channel in the DPRK, a result of the global sanctions regime, by expanding ‘swap’ arrangements whereby the UN agreed to provide funds to DPRK Government institutions outside the country, in return for an equivalent deposit in local currency to UN agencies’ accounts in Pyongyang. This allowed UNICEF to cover a limited number of critical programme and operational support activities for 2022, including costs of local data collection, monitoring of implementation of activities on the ground, small-scale training activities and office running costs.
 
Remote monitoring capacity was greatly expanded in 2022 and the tools and checklists developed have provided detailed information on status of supplies, the quality of programme implementation and identify key gaps in capacity development. The investment in remote monitoring as a temporary measure in the absence of international staff in-country has been vital in efforts to maintain donor confidence in UNICEF’s programme inside the DPRK. The design of the monitoring approach across different sectors such as health and nutrition has enabled a further platform for integration of capacity development and supervisory activities, helping to break down silos and align guidelines and training for a more holistic approach to programme interventions. The completion of a remote Country Programme Evaluation using paper-based questionnaires and surveys addressed the lack of access to online communication platforms by DPRK partners and provided another avenue for limited remote data collection.

Looking ahead, the lack of real-time, disaggregated data will prove challenging in developing a new Country Programme for the DPRK, a process which will potentially get underway in 2023. A return of the full UNICEF team to the country will be essential to build an accurate picture of needs, opportunities and possible innovations and partnerships that will define the strategic approach in coming years. 

"
EAPR,"EAPRO, Thailand",Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Partnerships and Engagement  
EAPRO continued to nurture a strong partnership with ASEAN across all sectors. A partnership to strengthen regional nutrition governance was extended for an additional three years with the ASEAN Secretariat. In collaboration with SEAMEO, the ASEAN Secretariat and the ASEAN Korea Cooperation Fund, EAPRO signed agreements for the second round of the Southeast Asia Primary Learning Metrics, which included Timor-Leste for the first time. EAPRO worked closely with ASEAN to present its regional framework on the rights of children in the context of migration at the International Migration Review Forum. EAPRO provided support to the launch of the Regional Plan of Action for implementation of the ASEAN Declaration on the Rights of Children in the Context of Migration. And EAPRO worked closely with ASEAN in the organization of the ASEAN ICT Forum on Child Online Protection. Under the ASEAN–UNICEF Framework for Cooperation, ASEAN contributed to the COVID-19 response, with $10 million for vaccine procurement – the first of such agreement. Moving forward, EAPRO will continue to harmonize and prioritize its partnership with ASEAN, especially in developing an agenda on children’s rights and evidence-based advocacy and policy that lead to concrete action at the country level.  

The Asian Development Bank continued to be an important partner, with UNICEF enhancing children’s rights in its developing member countries' project lending.  UNICEF re-established partnership discussions with the New Development Bank to explore areas of collaboration, including in WASH and Climate Resilience. 

With UNDP, UNICEF continued its role as co-chair of the Issue-Based Coalition on Inclusive Economic Growth and COVID-19 recovery. UNICEF also actively participated in the Issue-Based Coalition for Human Rights and Gender Equality and Women Empowerment as well as on Building Resilience. UNICEF also continued to be an important contributor to the United Nations Evaluation Development Group in supporting systemwide evaluation as well as the Peer Support Group in conducting quality assurance of United Nations Sustainable Development Frameworks.  

Lessons Learned: Data Systems  
The increased frequency and complexity of converging crises underscore the need for robust and timely data systems. For example, there remains a need to improve the collection of real-time data to better understand the increase in demand for services as well as uptake. There is a continued need to develop more nimble data collection methodologies and platforms to measure changes in key child indicators to monitor changes during crises. While big data and innovative methods for data collection mechanisms produce data to analyse trends and develop solid theoretical framework and hypotheses to test frameworks, solid evidence is needed for informing policies. The use of technology should remain a tool and not the driving factor for knowledge generation. Due to significant delays in accessing ‘cleaned’ data from administrative systems, there is continued reliance on out-of-cycle surveys or use of other collection instruments which increases the costs for timely availability and review of data to trigger corrective actions where and when needed.  

Lessons Learned – Elevating Children’s Rights 
The EAPRO ROMP has a dedicated outcome - protection and realization of children’s rights - which focuses on leaving no child behind. The first year of ROMP implementation highlighted the technical strength of the RO and the long-standing reputation of UNICEF as a lead agency in evidence and knowledge on children and adolescents as our core strengths.  On the other hand children’s rights and human rights language have become increasingly weak in programming, and newer staff members have weak knowledge and capacity on children’s rights. The siloed and sectoral focus of programmes could also  prevent UNICEF from working holistically around the Convention of the Rights of the Child. Moving forward, EAPRO will develop a regional advocacy strategy to advance children’s rights. Skilling staff through rights- and results-based management training will be prioritized so that children’s rights are embedded within the ‘DNA’ of every staff member.  
 

Lessons Learned - Knowledge broker, thought leadership and evidence generation  
Being a knowledge broker of children’s issues and future trends in the region is at the core of EAPRO’s work and is a ROMP strategy. The EAPRO team agreed that there are two assets in this area: existing EAPRO expertise, with all sectoral and cross-cutting teams having produced abundant evidence (research, studies, assessments), and a functioning governance mechanism through the EAPRO Research, Evaluation and Studies Committee. However, the team recognized the following challenges: (i) abundance of information available via multiple channels; (ii) the Research, Evaluation and Studies Committee has potential but it is not utilized optimally; and (iii) there is a disconnect between evidence and advocacy. As a way forward, the EAPRO team committed to bolster the Research, Evaluation and Studies Committee by identifying evidence gaps and developing a common theme for 2023 so that all teams contribute knowledge in a coordinated fashion.  

Innovation: Environmental and Social Safeguarding Standards (ESS) 
EAPRO brought in a dedicated ESS expertise and developed a training package to train all staff on ESS. This will be critical to ensuring programmes are designed, implemented and monitored in a way that reduces environmental and social risks, and hence will improve overall programme effectiveness and performance results. This is also a crucial foundation in place for accreditation with various climate funds and condition for many donors and partners. Given global guidance and policy directives are expected in late 2023, this will enable EAP to be ahead of the curve in having the capacity to implement ESS, while contributing to global guidance and policy.  

Innovation: Child Rights-Focused Programming Approach  
In line with ROMP commitment to elevate child rights in EAP, EAPRO supported country offices preparing country programme documents to systematically include child rights into the programme development process. This entailed the provision of foundational training on child rights/human rights to country office staff and partners.  Five CPD submitting countries (PNG, Mongolia, Fiji, Cambodia and Philippines) were supported in developing compendiums of key recommendations and concluding observations from the Convention of the Rights of the Child and other human rights instruments (CEDAW, Universal Periodic Review) to be used as a key resource document for the development of the CPD.  
 




"
EAPR,Fiji (Pacific Islands),Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been a major catalyst for innovation, creating significant opportunities for programmatic learning and improvements beyond the immediate emergency response.
 
The integration of COVID-19 into routine immunization programmes and primary health care is an opportunity to reach high-risk populations, remote outer islands and children who have missed out on routine vaccination, nutrition screening and micronutrient supplementation. 
 
The downstream programme planning and implementation support UNICEF provided to the PICTs around COVID-19 vaccines provided an opportunity to work with MoHs and other stakeholders, which strengthened collaboration and partnership, especially in countries where UNICEF conventionally works in upstream advocacy, policy and strategy. 
 
COVID highlighted the fact that PICTs lack adequate SBC strategies to respond to public health emergencies, with sparse data being a particular problem. UNICEF used U-Report polls and the Ona platform to conduct assessments of people’s views, perceptions, motivators and barriers to vaccination. For example, U-Report COVID vaccination polls were launched in Kiribati, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and FSM and the results were presented to each Ministry of Health so that the voices of U-Reporters were reflected to the programming. U-Ambassadors (youth advocates for U-Report) participated in the co-creation of poll questions.
 
Demonstrating (and documenting) solutions to close gaps in the quality and sustainability of WASH services in communities, schools and health care facilities proved successful in leveraging additional resources and partnerships for achieving results at scale. For example, in Vanuatu, the community Drinking Water Safety and Security Planning approach (nurtured and tested by UNICEF) generated USD$23 million through a Green Climate Fund (GCF). 
 
The delivery of emergency response actions with limited human resource capacity and no in-country UNICEF capacity proved challenging, especially in the initial stages of the COVID pandemic, when the need for local information is urgent, and access is challenging. Also, the lack of long-term agreements (LTAs) with local service providers negatively impacted the efficiency of the response. Mobilizing a dedicated, in-country UNICEF liaison officer in countries struck by natural disasters, pre-positioning supplies and locally procuring WASH emergency supplies proved essential for the timely response to COVID and humanitarian crises. Moving forward, systematic market analyses of local suppliers and technical experts, and the subsequent establishment of LTAs with quality local entities would be a valuable part of emergency preparedness.
 
As COVID-19 continued to spread throughout the region in 2022, with some countries experiencing their first community transmission and school closures, knowledge sharing between countries allowed for better informed and more efficient responses. 
 
Despite incremental advances in developing policy and legislative frameworks, building the capacity of PICTs’ social workforce and engaging communities on the drivers of violence, evidence suggests that very little impact has been made on reducing the prevalence of VAC. Considering the scale and life-long consequences of VAC, the CP sector is insufficiently resourced and ill-equipped to adequately prevent and respond to the problem. Without adequate financial and human resource investments, VAC will continue. 
 
Enacting legislation and endorsing multi-sectoral policies, plans and procedures takes time and requires lengthy, comprehensive consultation processes, engagement across multiple sectors, joint visioning processes, early identification and adaptive resolution of bottlenecks and ongoing advocacy. Changes in critical staff posts during the process inevitably slowed these processes, while COVID restrictions impacted the capacity of partners to meet and travel to outer islands for consultations. 
 
While the standard five-week CP social work training course has been a seminal resource in improving the capacity of the social service workforce in the region, it remains an entry-level course. Access to sustainable options for further education and training opportunities on more complex areas of CP is required. As countries in the region reopen following the pandemic, in-person and hybrid delivery of training and other capacity-building activities were initiated to continue supporting the learning process. Moving forward, UNICEF will explore opportunities with key partners to sustain this investment, including through accreditation by learning entities such as USP to deliver the course as an elective, specialization or as part of a standalone certificate or diploma.  
Publishing the Fiji MICS results via a user-friendly interactive online dashboard proved to be an effective way to disseminate the results widely at low cost.
 
Evidence-based advocacy, effective governance and efficient management of the social protection system are critical for strengthening the resilience of existing social protection programmes to respond to shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and climate-induced disasters.
COVID-19 border and movement restrictions were a key factor in the delay of the ECD policies. Given that borders started opening in late 2022, UNICEF has been catching up on in-person monitoring and technical support, thereby accelerating the development and finalization of ECD policies and tools. While political transitions in Fiji, Samoa and Vanuatu threatened to reverse progress, UNICEF continued to advocate on the importance of ECD with government partners. 
 
UNICEF is strengthening advocacy on ECD as an integral part of the climate-resilience agenda in the region. A scoping mission led by RMI’s Government to the 27th Conference of Parties (COP27) was supported to maximize opportunities to include ECD in the climate change discourse. UNICEF also supported PICTs in ensuring that a climate change lens is included in their national ECD policies. 
 
Moving into 2023, UNICEF will work closely with bilateral partners, donors, multilateral and regional organizations to enhance support on climate financing and action including investments in climate-resilient infrastructure, improve nutritional outcomes for children, address violence against children, and promote learning outcomes and skills. UNICEF is strategically positioned due to the organization’s capacity to create coherence between humanitarian and development programming. It provides UNICEF opportunities for high-level strategic engagement with key decision makers raising visibility for children in law, policies, and programmes and to address structural gender inequities that prevent young girls from having equal opportunities. This unique position will be strategically utilized to reinforce regional dialogue, particularly with and through young people as key decision-makers on matters of governance."
EAPR,Indonesia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In 2022, the ROOTS bullying prevention and the Early Grade Literacy (EGL) programmes showcased noteworthy innovations and highlighted the important role UNICEF plays in middle-income country contexts. In both initiatives, UNICEF’s contributions, including generating evidence-based models and policies and early engagement and alignment to the Government of Indonesia’s agenda, helped catalyse national commitment, ownership and public investment for sustainable programmes. In addition, the use of social and behaviour change communication (SBCC) and the engagement of children as agents of change were also critical to enhancing programme effectiveness.
1.      From evidence-based models to sustainable government-led programmes  
The ROOTS bullying prevention programme was originally developed by UNICEF to support the Ministry of Women’s Empowerment and Child Protection (MOWECP) in the implementation of the National Strategy on Elimination of Violence against Children 2016-2020. ROOTS was adopted by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology (MOECRT) as one of the most effective interventions to address one of the ‘three sins’ affecting children’s learning outcomes in schools, namely, bullying, intolerance and sexual violence. 
Since then, the MOECRT has embarked on a nationwide rollout of ROOTS using the Ministry’s own budget. With UNICEF’s technical support, ROOTS is now firmly cemented as an integral component of the Ministry’s education reform agenda which aims to improve learning outcomes, eradicate child poverty, cultivate ‘freedom to learn’ and, ultimately, lead to a more open and tolerant society. This uptake created a domino effect, with the Ministry of Religious Affairs (MoRA) engaging in ROOTS programming, with UNICEF support, in Islamic schools. Moreover, within UNICEF Child Protection, ROOTS, Life Skills Education (LSE) and positive discipline interventions are now embedded across various child protection, education and adolescent engagement programmes at the sub-national level as effective strategies to address violence against children and prevent child marriage. In less than two years, more than 200,000 children and adolescents have been trained as agents of change in formal and Islamic schools.
Several lessons can be drawn from the success of ROOTS: (i) investing limited resources to design evidence-based models can yield great dividends and are effective for government-led scale up; (ii) adopting a whole-school approach and complementing ROOTS with LSE for children and positive discipline skills for teachers and other school staff fosters ownership and, importantly; (iii) impactful models can have a cascading effect as demonstrated by the rapid expansion of UNICEF-government partnerships from MOWECP to MOECRT and, as of 2022, also with MoRA. 
2.      Evidence-based policy development and advocacy
UNICEF continued to innovate through its Early Grade Literacy (EGL) programme which seeks to improve the literacy and numeracy skills of disadvantaged children in Papua provinces. Several key strategies were pursued in 2022, including the provision of professional training of pre-service and in-service teachers to improve their ability to provide tailored instruction to their students consistent with the government’s emancipated learning reform agenda. This includes contextualised learning materials to promote a culture of reading within classrooms, schools and communities and advocacy to promote programme replication and scale-up through the development of a ‘scalability roadmap’ for local governments to follow. 
Leveraging UNICEF’s partnerships with local governments yielded good results in 2022. Commitment was reached with 14 district governments to use their own budget in 2023 (a total commitment of IDR30.5 billion or around US$1.9 million) to support implementation of EGL activities in schools within their districts. These commitments were driven by using an evidence-based advocacy approach, including drawing upon student learning assessments to demonstrate the positive impact on children and their communities by prioritizing investment in this area.
Key lessons learned include the importance of early engagement with government counterparts on the implementation of the EGL programme scalability roadmap, thus ensuring buy-in and alignment with government priorities. Furthermore, use of early grade student assessment data helped government counterparts focus on learning recovery and catch-up, especially for the most vulnerable students. Equipping teachers with gender inclusive approaches, including positive discipline, was also important for the active learning of all students.
3.      SBCC and public communications for enhanced programme effectiveness
UNICEF’s SBCC, advocacy and community engagement efforts focused on reversing the long-term socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 that threatens to reverse decades of progress achieved for children in Indonesia. Efforts focused on creating access to life-saving information through traditional and digital community engagement by increasing awareness on child vulnerabilities, promoting positive parenting behaviours, and advocating with key opinion leaders, decision makers and communities, all while empowering youth as agents of change for children.  
These initiatives contributed to strengthening routine immunization, supporting a safe return to school, creating awareness and advocating for the protection from online child sexual exploitation and abuse, reducing bullying in schools, preventing child marriage, promoting positive parenting behaviours to prevent stunting, and addressing climate change.  
Integrated campaigns were used effectively, including on safely managed sanitation in urban settings which reached around 55 million people on digital platforms with practical information on household sanitation. The back-to-school campaign, complemented with life-saving information, news and multimedia content advocating for urgent action to address the backslide in children’s learning reached 28.6 million people via television and 19 million digital users. 
Strategic SBCC was also leveraged to support the ongoing polio outbreak response in Aceh province, reaching targeted children in an outbreak setting dominated by mistrust and anti-vaccination sentiments. Social listening became core to understanding perspectives towards child rights and to detect and debunk hoaxes and misinformation across child rights priorities, while empowering communities to understand the importance of digital literacy. 

"
EAPR,Lao People's Dem Rep.,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The pandemic spurred the Country Office to further innovate to adapt to new situations to continue deliver results despite the challenging circumstances, while providing a work environment that supported each staff. For example, the introduction of flexi-time and working from home arrangements targeted staff well-being. A follow-up survey found such arrangements did not affect staff productivity and created opportunity to improve digital literacy among staff. Following global guidelines, flexi-time has been instituted for use beyond the pandemic.[1]
 
Despite the pandemic-related constraints and restrictions to many office activities and processes (such as a harmonized approach to cash transfer assurance, travel and procurement and logistics areas), the office continued to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of operations by creating a safe work environment, adjusting work processes and standard operating procedures and using corporate systems and tools, such as eTools, e-PSB, eGRC and mAsset. Direct cash transfers and invoice payments were delayed during pandemic-related movement restrictions, and the office could not timely trace all FACE forms and invoices. To address the issue, three payment-related procedures were updated, endorsed by the Country Management Team and implemented in 2022. For instance, invoice tracking sheets were introduced; but regular refresher training on their completion is needed in 2023.  
 
It became evident during the pandemic that parents were, in effect, first-line responders on a range of issues due to the curtailing of social services. UNICEF continued to work closely with the MoES, the MoH, the LWU and the LFND to roll out the pilot phase of the Love and Care for Every Child, with a multisectoral approach applying social and behavior change techniques. The aim of the programme is to stimulate community discussion and support  parents and caregivers make positive child-rearing decisions. The parenting package, Love and Care for Every Child – the first for the region – will be used by trained teams to engage rural communities via home visits, group discussions and community information sessions to help promote good parenting behaviours.  
UNICEF successfully pioneered the U-Money app in the Mother and Early Childhood Grant pilot, using innovative digital technology to achieve equity in outcomes, by reaching the most vulnerable women with young children. The app allows for cash to be transferred to women without a bank account via their mobile phone. This innovation compensates for the weak financial infrastructure in the targeted districts (no access to ATM machine, limited banking providers, etc.)  For persons without a phone, cash was delivered to local health centres for collection. These two options made the cash grant more equitable and enabled UNICEF to promote social behaviour change communication by encouraging beneficiaries to access antenatal and postnatal health care and vaccinations with posters, brochures and radio scripts in local languages. 
 
With UNICEF support and following the commitment of provincial governors, open-defecation-free coverage has accelerated rapidly since 2019, increasing from 11 to 65 per cent of villages in that time. Importantly, much of this progress was achieved using government funds. In 2022, Nambak District in Luang Prabang achieved open-defecation-free status solely with government funds. The commitment of the provincial governors was reflected by district governors at the Sanitation Forum in 2022 and was critical for the Ministry of Health to release district funds for Community Led Total Sanitation. Securing the political buy-in of provincial governors will likely continue to be a critical factor in leveraging the government’s support for increasing national open-defecation-free coverage.
 
Although schools reopened in early 2022, learning loss of students due to prolonged school closure was a great concern. Catch-up programmes proved essential to supporting children’s learning. UNICEF supported the Ministry of Education and Sports to develop and implement a four-week catch-up remedial literacy and numeracy programme focused on Grades 1 and 2 students. The remedial programme, implemented at this scale for the first time in Lao PDR, reached 8,320 Grade 1 and 2 students in six provinces due to funding support from the Global Partnership for Education, the European Union and the Government of Japan. School bags and stationery were provided to students as incentive to participate in the programme during the school break. The Ministry’s Department of General Education plans to introduce the programme to all primary schools across the country in January 2023.
 
The Government recognizes the increasing importance of expanding access to digital learning due to its benefits and the low cost of technology and the rapid pace of technological advancements. The Khang Panya Lao package now will complement in-class learning. The Ministry will use it as an integral component of the further digitization of the education sector. However, the expansion of digital learning is constrained by infrastructure challenges – electricity access and internet connectivity as well as the high cost of internet service and devices. If this is not addressed, there is a risk that the introduction of digital learning will perpetuate inequities for disadvantaged and underserved areas. The Country Office continued to advocate engagement by the Ministry of Technology and Communications and the private sector to address infrastructure constraints to expanding access to digital learning.
[2] 

UNICEF conducted three evaluations, enhancing the capacity of senior government officials to develop a Lao evaluation culture, and becoming one of the very few countries in the UNICEF to reach 1% expenditure on evaluations. Continued investments required to ensure evaluation capacities of CO staff and national partners engaging in and leading evaluation processes.

[1] UNICEF Country Office supported staff throughout the pandemic, providing ‘pocket WIFI’, monitors and IT equipment during the work-from-home period. Building on this, the Country Office provided fuel coupons to national staff in December to help with the increasing costs of fuel and traveling to the office.
[2] A high-level meeting co-organized by UNICEF in November brought together the Ministry of Education and Sports, the Ministry of Technology and Communications and telecommunication companies to discuss how to expand access to digital learning, generating a commitment from the Vice Minister of Technology and Communications to work with the private sector in this area and linking to the Government’s broader digital transformation plan.
 

"
EAPR,Malaysia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Although the general political uncertainty over the course of 2022 made planning difficult, UNICEF managed to influence discussions on the draft tobacco bill by leveraging long-standing relations with Members of Parliament and the Special Parliamentary Select Committee (PSSC) and producing a thorough analysis of its implications. Similarly, the timing and sequencing of advocacy initiatives, particularly on more sensitive issues, is crucial; UNICEF Malaysia must pro-actively scan the policy horizon to engage early on. 
 
Other key takeaway from 2022 advocacy efforts is that UNICEF Malaysia should engage in more systematised and audience-centred strategic advocacy, including SBC, on ending violence against children, with greater focus on structural bottlenecks. The capacity restraints, lack of professional recognition, under resourcing and supervision system of the SSW remain key obstacles to national service delivery on identification, prevention and response to violence, exploitation and harmful practices. In this regard, UNICEF should increase support for the establishment of a Children's Department under the MWFCD, engage in public finance for ending violence against children, and maintain a strong focus on SSW strengthening and reforming the Child Act and the Child Victims and Witness Act.
 
It is important to note that government agencies welcome detailed recommendations on implementation and related case studies - such as small-scale pilot projects - before advocating for scale-up at national or sub-national level. Agencies are more likely to be receptive to advocacy based on locally generated evidence, with clear recommendations on practical solutions to challenging issues. 
 
Long-term relationship-building for technical exchange between countries is a worthwhile investment. For instance, a peer-to-peer exchange to the UK organised by the PSSC had a significant impact on Malaysian stakeholders. A similar approach on child immigration detention is now being explored between Malaysian and Thai counterparts. Creating more platforms for peer sharing of good practices through study trips, staff exchange or staff secondment should be encouraged.
 
On programme implementation overall, strong partnerships are necessary to achieve results for children, especially the most vulnerable. To maintain relevance in Malaysia, design of programme initiatives needs to be sensitive to the evolving political economy. For example, until the national capacity on evaluation increases, country-led evaluations would require longer timeframes and greater assistance from UNICEF.
 
When engaging with partners, UNICEF should continue to take into consideration social and cultural norms and ways of working, which are as important as the presentation of factual evidence. Additionally, existing engagement with government counterparts outside of MWFCD and the justice sector should be increased.  
 
Ensuring representation of experts from diverse technical backgrounds in programme planning and implementation is important to develop robust and comprehensive programmes that meet the needs of wider groups. This became particularly clear during implementation of activities in East Malaysia. Increased subnational programming requires additional emphasis and scope of SBC communication. 
 
It is also important to develop multi-sectoral responses to the challenges facing children. Dedicated and strategic all-of-office efforts can drive more substantial results. This also applies to engagement with government: to ensure that children in Malaysia are adequately protected from climate, environmental, and disaster risks, for example, a cross-ministerial or agency structure is required.
 
Youth feedback on the digital engagement modalities utilized during the pandemic indicated online fatigue, coupled with increasing offline commitments. UNICEF has since changed approach and is now using integrated offline and online modalities to help sustain inclusivity and accessibility (through online platforms) and strengthened participation (via offline initiatives). Young people in Malaysia are extremely motivated to take action on social and environmental issues but frequently lack the necessary resources. There is value in providing a platform for the resources needed, with a focus on longer-term skill building and transferable skills development. 
 
On the Education front, online learning can exacerbate previously existing learning inequalities if not accessible to all teachers and learners, yet, paradoxically, online teaching and learning platforms that incorporate accessibility features and offline learning materials can be important ways to make education systems more inclusive. Establishing digital learning communities alongside platforms will maximize their successful and sustained use.
 
Strengthened partnerships have resulted in innovations for learning befitting an upper middle-income country such as Malaysia. This is evident through programming such as FS4A via Google Classroom and TikTok; global citizenship education via Google Earth; and Teacher Digital Learning Community via Google Classroom and Telegram groups. DELIMa prioritises democratisation of learning by giving teachers and learners support and collaboration options; focusing on digital learning (with accessibility features) for children, providing future skills and competencies; and helping teachers develop digital learning communities.

EAPR,Mongolia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF MCO highlights two areas of innovative interventions in 2022: digital learning and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the diagnosis of pneumonia. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, MCO supported the government in maintaining essential education services to the children of Mongolia, and in particular the implementation of digital learning solutions to pre-primary and primary education. These include the introduction of the first learner centered interactive content addressing the learning needs of children from remote herder families in a storytelling method, and by the development of a centralized open educational resource repository (Medle.mn) with Learning Management System functions. The collective efforts of stakeholders on digital transformation were recognized during the 77th UNGA TES and have been coined as a champion country on Gateways to Public Digital Learning. Furthermore, MCO was able to integrate digital transformation in education as a priority area for the new Country Programme of 2023-2027. During 2022, MCO introduced the first educational game, and support has been extended to the government in developing the Digital Competence Framework and Digital Action Plan of Education, which are the fundamental policy documents necessary to ensure comprehensive digital transformation. As part of this, MCO supported the GIGA initiative aiming to connect every school to the internet and regularly monitor schools’ connectivity. Some challenges remain for further advocacy and interventions. Students’ limited access to the internet, and thus online content, hinders further promotion and familiarization of this innovative learning experience. The lack of an information technology curriculum and gaps in teacher’s capacities in digital literacy are to be addressed for preparation of the competent 21st century citizens through MCO’s continued advocacy and technical support. Other lessons and areas of further improvement were identified as the high 
cost for online content development and the connectivity infrastructure establishment as well as integrated and comprehensive awareness targeting for parents, teachers and school management.
 
As pneumonia is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among children under five, the need for its timely and reliable diagnosis is high. Considering the vast geographical spread of citizens in Mongolia, the quality of diagnosis and treatment can be compromised at times. Responding to this lifesaving need, MCO experimented with an application of AI, Inspectra, for pneumonia diagnosis to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and consequently the quality of treatment across the nation regardless of remoteness or the availability of a doctor. In collaboration with the MoH and the National Center for Maternal and Child Health, the application is currently in the process of localization from Thai to Mongolian reference measurements. It will be piloted in Umnogobi province in 2023 for further analysis of the application’s relevance to minimize risk of errors, the improvement of reference database of x-ray imaging, verification of system operations, and an increase in public awareness and understanding in 2023. This initiative can reach up to 80 percent accuracy in diagnosis even beyond pneumonia, bringing further opportunities of low-cost diagnostics, and ensuring broader accessibility and universality eventually nationwide.

EAPR,Myanmar,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Humanitarian  access and Technology
  Humanitarian  access remains severely constrained nationwide with movement restrictions and  interference with humanitarian activities primarily by the SAC, but including  incidents by other parties to the conflict, impeding the delivery of  life-saving assistance to vulnerable populations. Closure of roads and  waterways, targeted internet shutdowns and restrictions on communities’  movement further impedes the ability of populations to access life-saving  support. 
  
  Safety  and security of communities, partners and staff are a key priority. UNICEF  field offices work with local organisations to this end. In 2022, as the  humanitarian needs in the Northwest escalated, the UNICEF Kachin field office  conducted a series of online and learning exchanges for 17 local  organisations (39 participants) working in Chin, Sagaing and Magway, to  support technical development and strengthen staff capacities to identify and  manage operational risks. Based on the lessons learnt and recommendations,  these interventions, including the Risk Management and Enhancing Negotiations  workshop, will be replicated across the seven field offices in 2023. 
  
  UNICEF  Myanmar has developed an access tracking and analysis system to  support programming prioritisation, advocacy, and engagement strategies at  local and national levels, with the aim of reaching more people in need of  life-saving services. The system supports the identification of the areas  with the most limited access, the major types of access constraints (for  example, denial by authorities threats to aid workers etc.)  and  provides the baseline data analysis to support the implementation of access  strategies specific to the local context. 
  
  Working  with the seven field offices, programme and supply sections, the emergency  unit has led an initiative using UNICEF’s corporate tool for data collection  and analysis, InForm. The INFORM platform utilises a common data collection  standard and suite of tools based on the Open Data Kit. Any form created with  an ODK-based data tool can be shared with other platforms, allowing  collaboration and integration with other agencies. Data security is key  feature of this platform and is critically important given the sensitive  nature of the access data collected. The emergency team has ensured that the  tools are compatible with the OCHA-led inter-agency access tracking system  and contributes to holistic nationwide access analysis and aligned  advocacy. 
  
  The  UNICEF tool was piloted in the third quarter of 2022 and the number of access  incidents recorded increased from 36 in July (the first month) to 88 in  November, with a total of 267 reported in the five-month period. The most  common access constraints are movement restrictions and interference, with  the MAF and SAC being the main parties responsible for the constraints. The access  tracker will be further developed in 2023. 
  
  UNICEF  has further enhanced field office capacities in the area of humanitarian  access. Staff are implementing local access plans, following participation in  a series of online webinars and in-person workshop led by the Office of  Emergency Programmes (EMOPS), based on UNICEF’s global Access Framework.  Evidence from the access tracker is being used and efforts to expand access  will be further scaled up in 2023. 
   
Programme  integration in peri-urban Yangon 
  Since  the start of the political and humanitarian crisis in 2021, UNICEF has  significantly expanded its footprint in peri-urban Yangon, with a focus on  eight townships that were placed under martial law. An estimated 720,000  pregnant women and children are living in these largely informal settlements,  typically in slum conditions where access to basic services is restricted or  unaffordable. UNICEF’s interventions have evolved from direct humanitarian  assistance to a more holistic systems approach comprising maternal and child  cash transfers, the health micro-insurance programme ‘Bright Start’,  installation of water treatment units, and complementary services such as  nutrition screening. Throughout 2022, UNICEF provided regular income support  to 7,000 families, tripled the coverage of Bright Start to over 31,000  participants, and reached 42,000 women and children with micronutrient  supplements. New water kiosks can produce drinking water for 100,000 people  that is 80 per cent cheaper than commercially bottled water.
  
  UNICEF  embedded the use of technology and innovation into its programmes from the  start. Community mobilisers use tablets and computer-assisted personal  interviews to register programme participants. Social assistance transfers  are disbursed via a mobile money platform and can be withdrawn as an  over-the-counter cash payment at more than 1,500 agents and shopkeepers.  Bright Start operates a free, 24-hour hotline that women and caregivers of  children can dial to request emergency care, speak with their family doctor,  or listen to information offered by an interactive voice response system.  Other communication channels include SMS and a Viber chatbot. Moreover,  third-party monitoring is conducted through mobile phone surveys with large  samples of beneficiaries.
  
  A  critical success factor has been the use of integrated approaches and  cross-team collaboration, with the cash transfer scheme serving as a platform  to link beneficiaries to complementary services. Programme cooperation  agreements with partners cover multi-sectoral interventions, including water,  sanitation and hygiene, nutrition, social and behavioural change, and  psychosocial support. On the ground, these interventions are delivered  through a network of 73 community workers and 48 mother support groups.  UNICEF has also invested in strengthening the capacity of community outreach  structures by delivering a series of trainings on topics such as maternal and  child cash transfers, interpersonal communication skills, infant and child  nutrition, and psychological first aid. Post-training evaluations point to  high levels of satisfaction with the quality and contents of the  courses. 
  
  An  important emerging opportunity is building systems to deliver services for  children with disabilities. UNICEF is scaling up screening processes to  identify children and adults with disabilities and put in place an online  Disability Management Information System (DMIS) that can be used by partners  to facilitate data storage and planning of interventions. Families with a member  with a disability enrolled in the cash transfer scheme already receive a  top-up in recognition of the additional costs of living with a disability. In  2023, UNICEF will also pilot new systems to provide access to assistive  technology and medical interventions and roll out training on disability  inclusion for frontline workers.
"
EAPR,Papua New Guinea,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Several innovations and lessons learned emerged as essential adaptations for service continuity. Many have become potential game changers, showing promise in making essential services more effective, efficient, and equitable, making access more reliable, especially for more vulnerable groups. 
 
Digital solutions have helped to improve UNICEF programme implementation, streamlining operations and processes and enhancing outreach. For example:
1)      Digitizing knowledge products as part of the EERRP ensured that the most up-to-date teaching, learning and training materials were available to students, teachers, school boards of management, parents and caregivers. A total of 4,147 pieces of content developed by UNICEF are now available as part of the National Department of Education's ""My PNG Home Study"" webpage. Further, the products were uploaded to 2,000 micro-SD cards as a Media Package to support continuous learning. Micro-SD cards can be used in mobile phones or tablets and passed to different devices, increasing access to the products in areas with low internet connectivity.  
 
2)      Further looking to expand educational services in hard-to-reach areas, UNICEF reached 46,042 students (21,921 females) and 46 teachers with 27 Remote Area Community Hotspot for Education and Learning (RACHEL) devices installed in selected schools. These portable, battery-powered devices store materials in an offline format, requiring no internet or mobile data. Coupled with a solar charger to provide continuous power, Library for All kits, the developed training manual and 64 training-of-trainers sessions were installed on the devices, providing students and teachers with the materials to improve students' reading and literacy skills. 
 
3)      Digital solutions have made critical developments in vaccine and logistic management. For example, the electronic logistics management system, mSupply, was rolled out in all 22 provincial stores and select 300 health facilities in nine provinces to improve vaccine and logistics management. And UNICEF installed remote temperature monitoring devices in 63% of provincial vaccine stores. Based on these devices, important decisions may be made, considering if the vaccines have been stored appropriately. In addition, these devices strengthen mSupply, simultaneously improving procurement, forecasting, warehousing, and distribution. 
 
Another key lesson learned by UNICEF is Influencing sub-national governance to ensure alignment with national and international frameworks. For example, under the UNICEF-supported Provincial Engagement Framework, five provinces approved and committed to implementing the Lukautim Pikinini Act (LPA), the national child protection legislation. The provinces have increased human capacity and are developing by-laws to protect children at local levels. In addition, the decentralization framework bridges the gap in child protection service provision, giving visibility, prominence, institutional reform, commitment, and resourcing of the LPA in the four levels of Government. 
 
Similarly, UNICEF supported the review of the national WASH in schools policy, engaging several subnational and national stakeholders. The consultations highlighted the need for updated data, and the inexistence of clear milestones and strategies limits the demonstration of measurable progress against achieving the targets in the policy. The Policy consultation stressed the need for a publicly funded WASH in School Strategic costed plan to accelerate progress toward the national target of all students and teachers having access to clean, safe, inclusive, and functional WASH facilities by 2030, aligned with the SDGs. 
 
This points to the challenge facing most child and adolescent-related sectors to ensure appropriate national budget execution for service delivery. Since 2017, social sector spending has only reached a high of 4.5% of the GDP. With inadequate reliable funding, service delivery remains unsustainable and aid-dependent, tenuous considering the global context. UNICEF's draft Public Financing for Children Strategy aims to advocate for national public expenditure for child-related sectors by monitoring key economic trends and fiscal policy responses, maxing out the impact of available resources and leveraging partnerships to mobilize resources.  
 
Looking forward, UNICEF PNG will fully embrace its focus on adolescent programming, in line with the organization's adolescent development and participation (ADAP) agenda. In 2023, UNICEF PNG will launch a Youth Advisory Group under the Social Policy Outcome area. This group will support the office in strengthening a network of adolescents and youths to promote and advocate for adolescent voices in sub-national governance mechanisms, helping young people to be agents of change. 
 
The PNG Teenpreneurs Programme furthers the ADAP agenda. The programme aims to strengthen entrepreneurship skills development in the national PNG Making a Living Curriculum. The Programme targets the Grade six level. This programme is also innovative as the country has yet to have a programme like this.
 
Importantly, UNICEF will continue its multisectoral and cross-cutting focus to ensure alignment and progress toward the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Decade of Action. With this, UNICEF will focus on the totality of children's needs through partnerships between the Member States, among other things, like the joint funding from the Government of Australia and the Government of New Zealand for the UNICEF area-based programme, called the Convergence Programme, and the emergency response to the election-related violence funded the same. 
 
UNICEF will continue to explore new funding streams and work more closely with partners in every sector to mobilize resources for children, specifically the private sector. In 2023, the Office will focus on internal capacity building for Business for Results. In addition, the office will expand on UNICEF's child rights and business approach with the private sector and leverage businesses' power to integrate child rights considerations in business operations and mitigate the adverse business impact.

In 2023, UNICEF's programming will build on these lessons learned, revisiting programmatic approaches and new designs. The learnings will also complement the completion of the  Country Programme Document 2024 – 2028, which will be presented to the Executive Board in 2023. Under this new framework, UNICEF will focus on systemic changes critical to addressing the underlying causes of children's mortality, poverty, vulnerability, gender inequality and exclusion. Furthermore, UNICEF will ensure alignment with the U.N. Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework, continuing its leading role to deliver system-wide results for greater coherence, efficiency, and effectiveness in contributing to the realization of the 2030 Agenda. In addition, it will ensure that UNICEF and all development partners continue to prioritize the development of children and adolescents in PNG.
"
EAPR,Philippines,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Using T4D solutions and government systems for humanitarian cash transfers 
The Core Commitments for Children in Humanitarian, UNICEF’s core policy and framework for humanitarian action, call for the inclusion of social protection in emergency response through the timely provision of humanitarian cash transfers to the affected population using existing government programmes, where feasible. On one hand, the bureaucracy can delay humanitarian cash assistance. On the other hand, working within established government systems promotes cooperation and ownership. Further, because it is cost-efficient, this approach is sustainable for UNICEF as it works with the Government through existing programme structures and supports systems strengthening, especially when donor support phases out. 
 
In the Philippines, cash assistance is distributed through the national 4Ps and AICS and the Ministry of Social Welfare’s cash transfer programme in BARMM. Since these programmes have been running for quite some time with varying success, UNICEF worked with the Department of Social Welfare and Development and the Land Bank of the Philippines to integrate humanitarian cash assistance for shock-responsive social protection. This was tested during the country’s response to Typhoons Rai and Nalgae in late 2021 through 2022, with UNICEF introducing the Humanitarian Cash Operations and Programme Ecosystem (HOPE) to the Government to provide post-distribution monitoring and the use of SMS-based payment verifications.
 
The Philippines is the first country in East Asia and the Pacific to use HOPE, UNICEF’s management information system that can collect beneficiary data; associate data with cash programmes; create a database of the target population; manage payment lists and send them to financial service providers (FSPs); reconcile payments; triangulate payment verification information directly from beneficiaries; and handle grievances and feedback. 
 
As a result, HOPE was able to facilitate the deduplication of beneficiaries to ensure a more accurate beneficiary list for payout. The system integrates open-source solutions and existing tools within the UN, such as UNHCR’s CashAssist, becoming a payment management solution to handle financial information and safely transfer them to FSPs. The challenge was in the interoperability with the CashAssist payment module which posed challenges during the actual run of several payouts. Learning from this experience, UNICEF continues to refine HOPE and develop its payment module for a more efficient execution during emergency response.
 
Supporting systems strengthening for humanitarian response and preparedness
The Philippines experiences an average of 20 typhoons a year – four to five of them cause humanitarian crises beyond the Government’s capacity. UNICEF supports the country’s response to and preparedness for emergencies through risk-informed approaches and strengthens the capacities and systems of government and CSO partners, particularly to support sector leadership and governance in planning, budgeting, capacity building, cluster coordination and information management. 
 
One of the most urgent needs during disasters is meeting the nutritional needs of displaced children whose access to nutrition supplements and services is severely limited, if not cut off altogether, for indefinite periods. Responding to this need entails an integrated, multi-sectoral approach where resources are pooled together to deliver critical assistance, especially for very young children in the Philippines where malnutrition is a chronic problem and worsens during emergencies.
 
Learning from past emergency responses, UNICEF worked closely with the Department of Health and the National Nutrition Council (NNC) to fully integrate Nutrition in Emergencies (NIE) into the Disaster Risk Reduction and Management in Health plans of all UNICEF-supported municipalities, resulting in 100 per cent institutionalization of nutrition in the DRRM-H plan for Eastern Visayas. On a bigger scale, UNICEF provided technical assistance to NNC in developing the NIE Strategic Plan 2023-2028.
 
The integrated, multi-sectoral approach includes equally robust WASH infrastructure interventions through strengthened local government systems which UNICEF supported by creating and capacitating barangay-level WASH committees with dedicated sanitation focal persons who advocate and lobby for WASH priorities. As a result, Zero Open Defecation (ZOD) verification, declaration, and monitoring policies were developed locally. This is important because ZOD communities strengthen the DRRM programme by ensuring that restored WASH services will function during the next typhoon or emergency. In Caraga, one of the hardest hit regions by Typhoon Rai, three municipalities and 53 barangays are now ZOD.  
 
Furthermore, to ensure effective coordination in future response and strengthen preparedness, UNICEF supported the creation of multi-sectoral coordination groups in Rai-affected areas that are also disaster-prone: Child Protection-GBV-Education-WASH Group in Dinagat Islands; a GBV-Protection Group in Southern Leyte; and provincial Education Clusters in Caraga and Southern Leyte. These groups created platforms for convergence and prompt referrals and were found to be more strategic, impactful, and sustainable in emergency contexts. Furthermore, UNICEF integrated measures on preventing sexual exploitation and abuse into its response.
 
UNICEF conducted an After-Action Review of its Typhoon Rai response to continuously support system strengthening. The review recommends critical actions for UNICEF to reinforce government capacities, particularly at provincial and municipal levels, in (i) child-centered preparedness and response, (ii) quality response including timeliness, comprehensiveness of the assistance provided, attention to gender equality aspects, disability and inclusion, equity, monitoring and reporting; and (iii) institutionalize child-centered preparedness through local policies, budgets and existing structures. 
"
EAPR,Thailand,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Laying the foundations

System strengthening is the backbone of UNICEF support in Thailand. Efforts in 2022 focused to a large extent on laying the groundwork for future impact over the course of the country programme: gathering data, engaging policy makers, building partnerships, and crafting cross sectoral approaches to ensure the delivery of results for all children in Thailand. 
 
Generating policy-relevant evidence that resonates with the needs and priorities of policy makers is instrumental to positioning UNICEF as a credible partner. The study on sustainable financing of social protection and multiple studies on inclusiveness and adequacy of the CSG and disability grants, as well as the HFSs on the impacts of COVID-19 have been examples of policy-relevant evidence which have substantiated UNICEF advocacy on a number of topics. Building on our long-established partnerships with NSO and DEPD, UNICEF brought the two departments together as part of our effort to promote better utilization of data in policy making and across the social sectors. 

The engagement of high-level policymakers is crucial to identify and cultivate champions able to advance the case for children in policy and legislation. Engagement in the development of the CSG MIS has been an example of a sustainable knowledge transfer and capacity building which can be utilised in other areas. Engaging key counterparts at sub-national level is also needed to ensure cohesion, ownership, and the ability to scale up plans. A renewed focus prioritising coordination and capacity linked to enhanced resources at the local level will be needed to fully achieve the amibitions of the Country Programme. UNICEF will work with the government to address these challenges in 2023.
 
Optimising change
 
In 2022, UNICEF spearheaded some important and innovative solutions to address new vulnerabilities and disruptions caused by recent global crises. For example, creative online solutions such as online breastfeeding counselling were trialled with the potential to benefit 600,000 young mothers annually. A chatbot system enhanced beneficiary experience when accessing disability benefits and services. 
 
The need for a coordinated holistic approach to mental health resulted in improved collaboration and harmonization of approaches between government departments, UN agencies including UNESCO and WHO, as well as civil society organizations who committed to the development of an integrated MHSPP plan for children and adolescents.
 
While there is increasing demand and acceptance for youth participation and voices in policy making networks and platforms, UNICEF focuses on how to support young people’s participation and advocacy to enhance impact. Relatedly, UNICEF will also follow how young people’s inputs have been integrated into decision-making, ensuring greater accountability for UNICEF and partners to young people. 

Enhanced relationships with key influencers to jointly advocate for and deliver results for children helped to strengthened supporter engagement. At the same time, the post-pandemic global economic slump and increased competition for public attention have presented challenges to leveraging these results to increase donations. Based on analysis of the Thai context, child–centred content appears to perform significantly better on UNICEF social media channels and UNICEF will invest to ensure increased understanding of the strategic and timely use of social media to underpin our objectives. 

Strong Partnerships for future results
 
In a high middle-income country such as Thailand, UNICEF’s power of influence lies to a great extent in its partnerships. 2022 saw an expansion of existing strategic partnerships and cultivation of new ones. In social protection and public finance management, these proved instrumental in advancing goals for more inclusive and sustainable social protection and social services for children, while a new partnership with the National Institute for Child and Family Development, Mahidol University, will ensure necessary expertise to support evidence generation for ECD. 
 
Partnership and engagement with the private sector are also key to advancing the goals of UNICEF Thailand. Partnership with the Thailand Education Partnership, a public-private coalition of stakeholders committed to improving Thailand’s education, significantly advanced the education recovery agenda. UNICEF will expand the Better Business for Children network with government, business associations, researchers, corporate practitioners, and others, bringing latest trends, locally and globally.

Cross sectoral engagement to ensure sustainable programming
 
Mainstreaming Social and Behaviour Change (SBC) is essential to ensuring sustainable at-scale progress. One study to better understand gender dynamics of parenting practices will provide recommendations to increase engagement of fathers in parenting practices and programmes;  another is planned to understand the demand and supply of childcare services for children below three, leading to a strengthening of ECD, social protection, and family-friendly policies in Thailand.
 
SBC input on the National Child Protection Strategy and on different legal provisions will inform campaigns and public advocacy events to end different forms of violence, abuse, neglect, and exploitation; a ‘campaign toolkit’ with unified messages and guidance will encourage implementation at the local level leading to sustainable change.  
 
An integrated approach to Emergency response for the influx population along the Thai Myanmar border, incorporating WASH, education, and child protection responses in a holistic manner, coordinated through a network of inter sector working groups, has ensured timely and relevant support. Capacity building of partners, community-based organizations and volunteers in the field ensures the sustainability of the approach. 

"
EAPR,Timor-Leste,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The  operational guidance on the right to participation of adolescents and youth  with disabilities constitutes an innovation. Many documents expose the  barriers that persons with disabilities face in Timor-Leste and dispense  broad, theoretical advice toward inclusion. However past experiences have  shown that in practice, those who want to include persons with disabilities  in their activities struggle to do so successfully. The operational guidance  developed in 2022 focused on “how” to include persons with disabilities  in-everyday activities, workshops, consultations, etc. It is a  fit-for-context, practical guide, based on requests and solutions from  adolescents and youth with disabilities, their parents, OPDs and local  leaders. The document, finalized in collaboration with disability focal  points from various line ministries and OPDs, was launched but will need  further dissemination in 2023. 
  
Another  innovation was the application of adaptive management principles to the  adolescent civic participation programme. A Monitoring, Evaluation and  Learning (MEL) plan was developed early on, deepening the results framework  by identifying specific signals that can provide an early sense of whether  expected results are on track or constrained. This led, for instance, to  monitoring oral interventions made by females and males during various  trainings, to promote equal participation, and to creating a unique, nominal  list of all programme beneficiaries to ensure continuity and impact among the  various activities. 
  
An innovation in UNICEF’s advocacy approach  was the use of storytelling i.e. sharing data on the situation of children  and gaining support for concrete actions by policy makers through a narrative  focusing on the impact of actions on the life of a Timorese child, Maria. The  story of Maria has become a symbol of the life of a child from the eyes of a  child, starting with the current situation baked with facts and data from the  SitAn (releasing Cortisol in the brain – associated with distress, focus and  attention), followed by how the situation could be different (releasing  Oxytocin in the brain – associated with empathy, care and connection), and  ending the story with concrete actions to have a different, improved life of  Maria. This approach worked very well in advocating for increased resources  for nutrition and preschools. 
  
While  significant headways were made with regards to increasing allocation for  children in the State budget, the budget advocacy carried out in 2022 also  brought some important lessons to be applied in future years. While it is  crucial to act upon opportunities, it is equally important to plan ahead,  review what evidence and costing is available and what needs to be developed  in advance, assign clear responsibilities within the Country Office, and  regularly review progress and adjust the plan. Similarly, the complexity of  the stakeholder landscape, with several other development partners carrying  out budget advocacy and with a multiplicity of partner-funded advisers  embedded in ministries, calls for a well-thought-out strategy to be  implemented over the longer term to ensure alignment of messages as well as  coordinated approaches. In this regard, working closer with UN agencies may  provide some opportunities.
  
UNICEF  continued to support the MoH in the establishment, reactivation, and training  of Mother Support Group (MSG) members to serve as community change agents by  promoting key care practices for children and pregnant and lactating mothers  at the community level. The establishment and training of community groups  were made possible through cooperation with local NGOs, who supported regular  meetings with the MSG to plan activities and resolve problems."
EAPR,Vietnam,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"To be effective in advocating and influencing government policy reform processes, UNICEF must analyze and understand the complex and rapidly evolving socioeconomic and political context of Viet Nam. This requires timely analysis of the context, as well as agility and adaptive programming approaches to address the changing context. Leveraging partnerships to deliver consistent, evidence-based and timely key messages increases the chances of government uptake of proposed reforms. 
 
One example of this was UNICEF’s 2022 advocacy for increasing access to and securing sustainable financing for treatment of severe acute malnutrition (SAM). Each year in Viet Nam over 200,000 children under five years suffer from SAM - 90 per cent of whom do not receive any treatment. UNICEF used the opportunity of the review of the Law on Medical Examination and Treatment (LET) to advocate for inclusion of SAM treatment to be covered by health insurance. The Office supported evidence generation, studies on coverage and cost estimates, learning visits for National Assembly (NA) members, sharing of experiences from other countries, development of policy briefs, using of media for public awareness, and targeted advocacy with key Government leaders at both national and sub-national levels.  
 
This advocacy effort was innovative and agile - finding solutions in real time, based on the evolving situation as the law progressed through its review process. This included using national and NA media channels immediately prior to NA sessions to highlight the issue of SAM and the need for its treatment to be included in LET; utilizing the visit of the UNICEF Executive Director to Viet Nam to highlight  the issue with the Deputy Prime Minister, the Vice-Chairman of the NA and the Permanent Representative of Viet Nam to the UN – sharing her personal reflections after visiting SAM children in a rural hospital; and timely engagement of NA members from provinces with high levels of SAM, raising their awareness and enabling them to speak out during NA sessions. 
 
Despite these efforts, LET was adopted without UNICEF’s proposed revisions, in part due to changes in leadership in the Ministry of Health. Nevertheless, the process has laid a strong foundation for continued advocacy on expanding access to SAM treatment and set a high bar for other advocacy campaigns in the future.
 
Gender-responsive and transformative programming advanced in 2022, with an important focus on workforce strengthening. In the justice sector, UNICEF supported the Committee for the Advancement of Women of the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) to develop an e-learning course on gender mainstreaming and gender-based violence. Launched in June, the e-learning course attracted a significant enrollment (more than 2,100, 75 per cent were female) of justice officers, law school students, and others interested in the topic. Thanks to this stronger focus on gender mainstreaming, UNICEF and its partners identified that almost none of the male-only forensic specialists within the health sector had received specialized training on skills and techniques in working with child victims, mostly females. Based on this critical insight, UNICEF will provide capacity building for this target group to prevent revictimization and promote the best interest of the child.
 
In WASH, UNICEF, in partnership with the Regional Office, is working on an innovative approach with partners for empowering women in the WASH sector to contribute towards a more gender balanced cadre. Increasing gender diversity in the WASH sector workforce will expand the talent pool and strengthen water and sanitation utilities’ financial performance, innovative capacity, operating efficiency, and customer relations. To help achieve this goal, UNICEF Viet Nam co-developed the Network for Women’s Empowerment in WASH network, with government partners. The network aims to promote women’s leadership and solidarity in this male dominated sector and will act as an important platform for women to come together and share their initiatives, good practice, personal skills development and motivation to enhance the career development for female professionals in the WASH sector.
 
New forms of partnership demonstrated excellent potential and revealed some challenges to UNICEF systems. UNICEF Viet Nam proactively sought to expand partnerships with education technology companies (EdTech) in 2022, revealing several lessons learned. Firstly, stronger engagement with universities and research institutions is important to strengthen and promote education technologies and innovation. Secondly, increasing engagement and collaboration with for-profit EdTech solution providers requires further thinking around UNICEF’s position on open-source products to ensure sustainability of interventions at no cost to the end-user. Thirdly, UNICEF’s internal procurement processes for digital solutions would benefit from greater agility and clearer guidance on data design and handover and on open-source licensing requirements. As UNICEF moves rapidly towards expanding such partnerships, operational solutions will be essential.
 
Other new partnerships included the UNICEF Next Generation (NextGen), which grew from 30 members in 2021 to 427 members by the end of 2022. These young leaders, influencers, entrepreneurs, and innovators have committed to offering their expertise and acting as advocates for UNICEF's priorities. The ""Friends of UNICEF"" community also expanded, witnessing a 188 per cent increase inmembers. The rapid expansion of these networks demonstrates the public’s growing interest in partnership with UNICEF and sets a solid foundation for future advocacy and campaigning. Looking forward it will be critical to sustain these partnerships with regular information, opportunities for engagement, and motivation for further growth.

Lengthy government approval times for new project documents delayed project implementation in 2022, the first year of a new programme cycle. More stringent new policies by the Ministry of Finance related to ODA, led to significant delays in annual workplan signing. To ensure implementation and utilization were reasonably on-track by year-end, a cross-functional trouble-shooting team between Operation and Programme facilitated out-of-the-box thinking to find solutions. For example, UNICEF undertook direct implementation of critical activities and implementation of remaining activities was compressed into quarter four of 2022. Adaptive adjustment, based on cross UN agency learning, is needed and important to ensure that UNICEF Viet Nam stays effective and relevant in the country’s new context.

ECAR,Albania,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In 2022, UNICEF Albania continued implementing its pledge to foster innovation through programming efforts. UNICEF sought to achieve this through advancing digital platforms; new ways of financing; and different modes of working to boost impact and efficiency.  

The EU screening process provided an opportunity for UNICEF to use technical support provided to different ministries and institutions for short- and long-term system strengthening.

UNICEF took a collaborative approach by bringing together stakeholders from different backgrounds to develop a programme for young people focused on 21st century skills development including skills on technology and innovation and ways to incentivize young people to stay in school and stay in Albania. The initiative provides efficient and innovative ideas on education such as digital books to boost innovation towards digital education. This is being done with the Ministry of Finance and Economy, and the National Agency of Skills and Employment, Minister of Children and Youth, and the Italian Embassy.
UNICEF started to engage more with the Albanian innovation ecosystem during 2022 through UPSHIFT with the aim of strengthening entrepreneurship and empowering youth’s access to the start-up community. Adolescents also benefited from creating bridges of cooperation between Afghan refugees and Albanian youth to co-design solutions for their community together, which was organised by the joint UPSHIFT edition. In addition, UNICEF partnered with ICTsLAB for the Uplift Project, which is a start-up incubator for early-stage entrepreneurs. The programme offers four months of programming, networking possibilities and training in entrepreneurship. 15 solutions benefitting more than 3,000 young people have been implemented.

Tirana European Youth Capital (TEYC) created a momentum to strengthen not only the collaboration with the Municipality of Tirana and youth Civil Society Organisations, but also to bring a wealth of European models of youth participation in the country. Synergies between UNICEF and the TEYC were created in support to career promotion, soft skills development, career programs, etc.  
Significant efforts were made in the digital transformation of the entire lifecycle of Albania’s education system, by investing in the enhancement of teachers’ skills in the transfer of knowledge related to new technology and digital tools to improve learning outcomes. The UNICEF initiative Akademi.al, the national e-Learning platform, continued to provide services for 516,178 children (252,927 girls) and 48,152 teachers in language learning for the former and training on blended learning for the latter. The platform reached a significant milestone by expanding to include interactive learning for children aged five years with a series of 136 videos and lessons aligned to the preschool curricula. Furthermore, in an attempt to address the associated funding requirements, UNICEF started exploring new financing models to address school needs. Together with the private sector, civil society organizations, MoES and municipalities a pilot phase of designing an open source and sustainable crowdfunding platform was launched. UNICEF worked closely with the regional office to strengthen the sustainability of Akademi.al and continued providing schools with information communications and technology (ICT) support (25 tech hubs) ensuring blended learning for about 8,000 students and ongoing coordination efforts between the MoES, MoYC, National Agency of ICT (AKSHI), and the World Bank is ensuring the sustainability of the model.
The number of girls considering vocational, education and training (VET) as a successful career path is normally lower than boys so a digital and media campaign targeting girls and their families/ caregivers to consider VET education was launched in 2022. It addressed gender stereotypes while raising awareness of the opportunities of VET education especially in ICT, agriculture, hospitality and tourism.

National Child Protection Help Line ALO 116, in 2022, introduced the “Raporto Tani”, a web-based reporting platform and mobile application that develops real time online dashboard and data repository. The tool allows child protection professionals, researchers, policymakers, to analyse the accumulated data and trends helping them make informed decisions and interventions.  

A partnership with the national theatre group in the production of the play “Festen” generated significant media interest and triggered public discourse about domestic violence and directly engaged over 2,200 theatre spectators. This new and innovative approach has the potential to allow for better understanding of protection issues affecting children and encourage reflection among diverse groups of Albanian society.

Supported by UNICEF, INSTAT prepared the ‘Children, Adolescents and Youth-Focused Wellbeing Indicators 2017-2021’ report (yet to be published). Different from previous publications, the presentation of the indicators’ trends over the years, conveyed through graphs, is accompanied with summary explanations to enable data interpretation and ease of understanding. Supplementary to the publication stands the online panel/dashboard, a deposit of at least 120 indicators, from the fields of demographics, health, protection, alternative care, justice for children, training and education, and ICT. These indicators will play an essential role in the planning and monitoring of the national policies, as well as tracking the progress of SDG implementation and the realisation of milestones for EU integration. 

UNICEF of Albania, Montenegro and Serbia completed the ‘Gender in Emergency Response’ exercise – a learning opportunity to capture how gender issues were reflected in COVID-19 response efforts and will contribute to organization-wide learning on gender equality in emergency response and programming. 
U-Report has become a major tool in policy development such as for youth strategy, air pollution, Transforming Education Summit Call of action etc. While 360 youth were actively engaged involved in poll design and feedback discussions after polls, 10,000 youth were reached through various outreach activities organized by U-reporters.
 
UNICEF Albania introduced the online study findings dashboard linked to the Report on ‘Second wave survey of knowledge, attitudes and practices of Albanian youth regarding human trafficking in four regions of the country, and among Roma’.  The dashboard, enriched with easy-to-understand visuals and full range data disaggregation, aims to promote open access to data and research. Researchers, academia, NGOs and other stakeholders can utilize the dashboard to expand on the analytical work and be able to meet their needs for evidence generation in this theme of research.  

"
ECAR,Armenia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"2022 was the first full year of implementation of the new Country Programme which also coincided with the first full year of the new Government and a series of parallel reform processes. All of this, coupled with the multiple crises already described, made for a very complex and dynamic context within which UNICEF Armenia had to continuously adapt its programming approach. From this experience, several lessons learnt, and innovative approaches emerged. 
Conscious investment of time and other resources in emergency preparedness was critical to improve the CO’s capacity to respond in a timely and effective way to the recurring emergency situations. The comprehensive emergency preparedness exercise conducted by UNICEF Armenia with support by ECARO and EMOPS resulted in several measures being put in place, particularly staff capacity building, clear definition of roles and responsibilities, supply stockpiling, and establishment of contingency humanitarian programme documents. This enabled the CO to significantly increase its response capacity. When developments around the Lachin corridor resulted in some children being stranded in Armenia, UNICEF was the first responder for management of child protection cases and distribution of vouchers for clothing, thus marking a clear improvement in the timeliness and effectiveness of the response. This experience led to the recognition that Armenia’s particular situation requires constant attention and investment in emergency preparedness actions with conscious involvement of all staff. With this awareness, the CO will continue actions in this direction also in 2023. This also led UNICEF Armenia to be one of the strong promoters of updating the UN inter-agency contingency plan and defining key priorities to concretely improve inter-agency response capacity. 
In connection to this, UNICEF Armenia also realized the importance of having a foot on the ground in border areas that are likely to be most affected by emergencies linked to recurrent tensions following the 2020 conflict. For the first time the CO – with ECARO and EMOPS financial support – established permanent presence in Syunik, one of the impacted border regions and the only entry point into Armenia through the Lachin corridor. The first three months of experience with this modality have already shown the benefits of this presence in terms of significantly increased capacity to constantly monitor the situation as well as improved partnerships and understanding of the dynamics between the stakeholders in the region. The Country Office will therefore seek resources to strengthen this presence.
Over the last several years, UNICEF programming in Armenia focused on strengthening national systems for better outcomes for children as often required in middle income country contexts. In implementing the humanitarian response to multiple crises, besides adopting typical emergency-type approaches based on direct service delivery, UNICEF Armenia leveraged the already established expertise and partnerships and supported the adjustment of national systems. The humanitarian response was therefore mainstreamed in the implementation of the overall programme and in some cases merged with development programming. In line with the humanitarian-development nexus’ principle, this innovative approach for the Armenia context enabled an immediate response to urgent humanitarian needs while building a response through established national systems, thus ensuring greater sustainability and at-scale results.  In this context, UNICEF Armenia leveraged its expertise and recognized advisory role to promote integration of shock-responsive considerations in the ongoing reform processes in multiple social sectors. An example of it is the integration of specific provisions to assess the needs and target children and families affected by emergencies within the new national Social Protection Strategy. 
Another key lesson learnt relates to the need to continue working even more intensely on strengthening cross-sectoral linkages and promoting coordination mechanisms to address the needs of different categories of vulnerable children in an integrated manner. UNICEF’s convening role was re-confirmed this year and its unique added value was recognized in a context where inter-sectoral coordination remains a critical bottleneck for policy making and implementation.  UNICEF CO played a critical role in enabling clear communication between different sectors/ministries about the alignment of various interventions in respective sectors with each other and connecting those in terms of timing and scope under the umbrella of a broader vision linked to the ongoing multi-sectoral reforms. As an example, efforts to strengthen community-based family and child support centres/crisis centres managed by MoLSA were linked to the process of establishment of pilot Barnahus facilities by MoJ. As a result, a momentum of united political will was created and UNICEF-coordinated cooperation is currently happening between three ministries and sectors (social services, justice and law enforcement) to bring Barnahus to life. In the coming years it will be important to capitalize on this recognized added value by UNICEF while also ensuring coordination becomes an institutionalized practice in the broader child protection system.
Another UNICEF-supported initiative aimed at promoting inter-sectoral coordination, the national Strategic Programme of the Protection of Child Rights 2017-2021, was the object of a review and evaluability assessment this year, which generated important lessons learnt. The review commissioned by UNICEF in collaboration with the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs revealed shortcomings related to the strategy design and monitoring, which affected effectiveness of implementation. The findings were discussed by the National Commission on Protection of the Rights of the Child and were considered in developing the new approach on planning and monitoring for the new Law on Child Rights.
Another important lesson learnt relates to the work on behavioral change and social norms. Especially with the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic and the growing need to support national partners in effectively and rapidly communicating key messages to the public, communication for behavioural change has become an increasingly critical programmatic strategy for UNICEF in Armenia.  To address this need, this year the CO recruited a dedicated Behavioural and Social Change Officer.
"
ECAR,Azerbaijan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The country office promoted a culture of field presence and closer engagement between UNICEF staff and beneficiaries, beyond just programme specialists. Programme assistants and operations staff actively participated in field visits, contributing to improving our programme, while acquiring a sense of ownership for the work colleagues contributed to directly and indirectly.

The limited human resources in the Country Office with only one fixed term appointment staff under each programme sector created significant challenges for cross-cutting issues, including sufficient staff time to serve as focal points of cross-cutting topics such as gender and climate change. However, the Country Office continued to encourage programme specialists to lead and coordinate the projects cut across the sectors. Some good examples include the Early Childhood Development programme where engagement with social media influencers was tested to promote messages about breastfeeding, positive parenting, and fathers’ engagement, and the EORE programme, where the power of football was used to strengthen the engagement of young girls and boys on messages around the dangers of explosives and mines.

The country office finalized its climate change strategy, engaging each sector, and already started incorporating climate change elements into its programme. In addition to the primary healthcare waste assessment , UNICEF Azerbaijan’s partnership with the Azerbaijan State Museum of Art resulted in another innovative approach to raising awareness amongst the population, including children, on Climate Change. The “Hippo Planet” exhibition on climate change marked the start of UNICEF Azerbaijan’s work on Climate Change. It was designed specifically for children and young generations, and included a timetable of activities and workshops for school children to learn more about Climate Change through UNICEF’s mascot Simon the Hippo. Information sessions with young activists, policy makers and journalists also complemented the program for adults.

Within the health programme, ongoing healthcare reforms caused the fragmentation of service delivery, uncertainty of roles and responsibilities among government stakeholders and miscoordination of complex programmes, such as immunization of children. This was one of underlying reasons of the recent backsliding in vaccination coverage. However, UNICEF initiated a national immunization workshop to bring all responsible agencies to one platform and analyse the programme as a whole, to identify coordination gaps and solutions. This bold approach resulted in all stakeholders committing to having regular meetings along with a clear division of roles and accountabilities endorsed by top government levels, for a smooth coordination between MoH, SAMHI and TABIB, and ultimately quality service delivery. 
Another key lesson learned was that the country needs strong cross-sectoral partnerships among government agencies for reforms on Child Protection and child rights. Duplication and overlapping functions, as well as the lack of a national-level supervision and monitoring system for local child protection agencies, created serious gaps and violations in the fulfilment of child rights. Besides this, decision-makers in line ministries need to have a strong technical capacity in child rights issues aligned with international standards. Government policies and practices in child protection should be focused on prevention, family and community-based alternative care, and non-custodial measures, instead of continuing an ad-hoc response, institutionalization, and detention measures which definitely are not in line with children’s best interests.

In 2022, the unique role of UNICEF’s persistent programme-led advocacy, technical support and partnership relations with government agencies ended up promoting the Guidelines on child-friendly communication and procedures in judicial instances. Since the Guidelines are not legally binding, the Ministry of Justice was reluctant to share it with the courts. However following the persistent actions of UNICEF Azerbaijan, an alternative solution was found, and finally, the Supreme Court of Azerbaijan recommended the Guidelines to all courts.

One of the major highlights in 2022 was the collaboration with the State Statistical Committee and the engagement of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic for the first time. By establishing direct and clear communication with the Statistical Committee, and heavily investing in ensuring an honest and healthy relationship, we have once more confirmed that direct communication helps in avoiding miscommunication and supports effective and productive partnerships. It also builds trust, a core value that is needed throughout the MICS process and beyond.

On the effectiveness of the programme, no resources were invested in evaluations in 2022 due to the lack of advanced planning of resources and joint ownership with government over evaluation related activities. Moving forward, and already started in 2022, UNICEF Azerbaijan is including budget for evaluations in almost all proposals and at an early stage engage with government counterparts about the importance of evaluations in the context of to assess the relevance, effectiveness and efficiency of UNICEF interventions.

Maintaining a solid and happy team, through the true partnership between staff association, senior management, operations & programme, and by promoting a culture of living by UNICEF’s Core Values of Care, Respect, Integrity, Trust, Accountability and Sustainability, is the one of the most important ingredients to getting work done from the heart for children. It is equally important to maintain the political space required for UNICEF to deliver its mandate. Resource abundance is secondary.
"
ECAR,Belarus,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"From end 2021 through 2022, Belarus faced migrant and refugee crises that pushed the systems to respond to heightened vulnerabilities of children and families. Responses from upper middle-income countries like Belarus underscored the nexus between humanitarian and development interventions and the opportunities that can be taken to strengthen the overall systems.
In both the Belarus-Poland border migrant crisis and the Ukraine refugee response, the Government has led actions with the Office’s role being to share good practices from humanitarian contexts and scale up existing protection responses with national and local partners to strengthen the system’s overall responses for children.
 
·         Strengthening the system’s ability to protect children
 
The migration crisis and refugee response to Ukraine created opportunities for enhanced cooperation with the Government and especially with regions most affected. The increased number of vulnerable children produced the momentum to scale up existing protection models such as case management and psycho-social responses. Through collaboration with the Grodno administration and Grodno Social-Pedagogical Centre, the PSS approach developed in the “Safe Space” model was applied to provide timely responses to migrant children in the ‘Bruzgi’ logistics centre. Likewise, through partnership with BRC and Brest and Gomel Social-Pedagogical Centres, the office established 12 child-friendly spaces (CFS) that provided PSS services to more than 300 children. CFS serve as sustainable protective environments for all vulnerable children living in Belarus.
The increased number of vulnerable children highlighted protection issues that are not as visible during ‘regular’ times. For example, experiences from the Belarus-Poland migrant crisis as well as Ukraine refugee response highlighted legislation gaps in protective mechanisms for unaccompanied or separated children (UASC) not seeking asylum, where they didn’t have an official ‘status.’ With support from UNICEF and other UN agencies, the Department of Migration and Citizenship under the Ministry of Internal Affairs has established a taskforce to assess the normative framework and develop intersectoral mechanisms on identification and referral of UASC.
These conditions also established the impetus to expand frontline workers’ capacities. Increased protection needs among children enabled professionals to fine-tune their skills. Increased need matched with additional resources for capacity building on issues such as GBV identification, trauma responses, and prevention and identification of violence among refugee children enhanced these professionals’ overall capacities. With skills strengthened during the emergency period, specialists’ capacities have increased for the longer term to ensure greater protective interventions for all children in Belarus.
 
·         Enhancing existing and building new partnerships for better outreach and targeted social protection
 
The humanitarian situation also has created opportunities for expanding partnerships that can enable greater reach and expansion of social protection schemes to refugee families with children based in Belarus . For example, the CO’s signed a three-party partnership with the Belarus Red Cross and Belarus Post Office (BelPotcha) in delivery of one-time cash transfers, which provides a venue to expand outreach to families with children in remote areas. BelPotcha has the largest distribution network in Belarus with more than 3000 offices throughout the country 
While the office has always worked with all regions in Belarus, the emergency circumstances created the opportunity to expand and formalize collaboration with state authorities at subnational level. The CO signed a workplan with Brest Oblast, containing a scope of activities aimed to strengthen system responses for child protection at the local level and at the same time supporting the emergency preparedness and response connecting humanitarian and development nexus. Furthermore, the Office is in consultation with Gomel and Grodno oblasts to expand collaboration in 2023. Results and lessons learned from these collaborations will provide evidence and strong ground to advocate for scaling the process across Belarus.
 
·         Building momentum for Solidarity among Society
 
The emergency also established momentum for solidarity among society, expanding the space for a dialogue on child rights and protective measures. To complement government responses, volunteers gained opportunities to actively support the humanitarian response for Ukraine children and families, assembling more than 4,500 hygiene kits and organizing recreational and educational activities in 7 summer camps for approximately 90 refugee children. At the same time, communities also enhanced support through donations, with resources from individuals almost tripling in amount on the Global Giving Platform connected to CO website; approximately $300,000 was raised for the Ukraine emergency response and regular programme activities.

ECAR,Bosnia and Herzegovina,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"4.1 Lessons learned
UPSHIFT represents a good practice that yielded great results in reaching the most vulnerable adolescents and equipping them with the entrepreneurial skills required to bridge the gap between the supply of graduates and 21st-Century labour market demands. Through direct engagement and outreach in schools from rural areas and smaller municipalities, UPSHIFT resulted in 35 per cent of all participants coming from marginalized groups. To ensure smooth transition to the labour market, follow-up with UPSHIFT participants is needed.
To respond to the protection needs of children and parents from Ukraine, UNICEF partnered with CSWs and Red Cross at the entity and local levels, building upon the lessons learned from CFS in other locations in BiH. A key lesson has been to consult the targeted population frequently, particularly as their needs change: once the children began attending their online classes in local primary schools, the interest and relevance of CFS intervention increased.
As part of the implementation of the complementary DRR cross-sectoral model, CSWs and primary and secondary schools from 10 partner locations have tested their crisis preparedness capacities in the multisectoral crisis field simulation exercise. The exercise allowed for stress testing plans and systems covering 10 local communities, with a special focus on vulnerable population groups and their needs in emergency response, as well as the importance of well-established coordination mechanisms between the protection and rescue, education, social and child protection, health, and agriculture sectors. To enable system-level integration of social sectors in the DRR agenda, UNICEF supported the development of the Sendai Framework mid-term review in BiH by integrating some of the most important lessons learned and opportunities for DRR improvements in sectors relevant to children.
 4.2 Emerging opportunities and innovations
Innovative engagement was established in the development of Social Entrepreneurship (SE) schemes and ICM mechanisms. Strengthening of SE practices through 10 local schemes is recognized as a key innovative element of social development and social policy planning, moving away from reactive social spending towards a proactive role of social protection (SP) systems. The ICM model that stimulates labour activation of SP beneficiaries through enhanced cooperation of the employment and social protection sectors carries huge potential to complement the new vision for the SP sector, not only in equity and targeting but also in addressing poverty including child poverty. In close cooperation with entity-level associations of social workers, public employment services, the private sector and local organizations, both practices proved to be viable opportunities worth developing to foster innovative social service delivery targeting the most vulnerable families and children with a focus on their human capital potentials.
Opportunities to engage with non-traditional governmental partners have emerged. UNICEF signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the CRA, focusing on improving internet connectivity for primary and secondary education institutions in BiH. The CRA now owns the ICT mapping produced by UNICEF: using mapped static geospatial and other related data, UNICEF and the CRA will work on positioning BiH schools onto the Giga platform.
Following the numerous innovative EdTech solutions introduced by UNICEF BiH, a supply monitoring methodology was created, and the first monitoring of its kind conducted, resulting in findings that will inspire new directions of UNICEF interventions, particularly in the domain of electronic and electrical waste management, given that no clear e-waste management procedures and instructions exist in the majority of BiH administrative units.
The newly established BAC enables new opportunities for partnerships with the private sector, especially in 21st-Century skill-building focusing on transferable skills, employability skills, and green skills. Through the involvement of the private sector, with their expertise and direct engagement of their employees as experts and mentors, UNICEF aims to design skill-building programmes that respond to the needs of the labour market. In addition to launching the BAC, opportunities for cooperation with the private sector have been further stipulated through PPP feasibility studies, which build upon the co-investments of seven administrative units. PPP for education will be incorporated into official PPP catalogues, thus triggering PPP mechanisms for long-term partnerships. 
In partnership with Nova Generacija, a new council of children and adolescents will inform the work of Bluephone, a helpline that provides children with support related to violence and MHPSS, ensuring that the needs and views of children and adolescents, particularly adolescent girls, strongly inform and are integrated into the programming.  
Striving to advance gender-transformative programming, UNICEF BiH completed a comprehensive Gender Programme Review suggesting emerging opportunities for GAP implementation building on the successes of such initiatives as capacity building of teachers in gender responsive teaching methods, MHPSS for adolescent girls and social entrepreneurship programme targeting women, who are long unemployed with low education and skills, victims of domestic violence, single mothers. 
Within its efforts to strengthen the humanitarian-developmental nexus across all programmes, UNICEF participated in the Youth on the Move fellowship programme, engaging one fellow to support the emergency response team through an innovative programme that aims to engage displaced young people in the work of UNICEF.  
One programmatic innovation was a specific set of child safeguarding and brief on-site trainings for staff and volunteers working with children on the move, which were introduced as obligatory in Sarajevo Canton prior to any engagement with children, along with signing a code of conduct. 
As part of the innovation in Climate, Environment, Energy and DRR, the horizontal expansion of the SRSP model is recognized as one of the best practices in the ECA region, being increasingly relevant also during the new emerging crisis as it is focused on system preparedness and service continuity as an important mitigation mechanism in addition to (often constrained) cash provision to affected families.
The digitalization of the immunization system initiated by UNICEF BiH in 2022 is a significant innovation within the health sector, providing a unique ICT tool for managing all relevant information related to the vaccination of the country’s population. It will also improve the national immunization programmes’ ability to meet regional and country-specific routine immunization and COVID-19 reporting requirements in accordance with international standards."
ECAR,Bulgaria,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The previous Country Programme, including the year 2022 demonstrated added value of UNICEF supported models of innovative services, especially if linked and  in synergy with UNICEF support for national policy revisions and development. This was confirmed by the Country Programme evaluation conducted in 2022. This was used as the main modus operandi in 2022. For example, the  implementation of the ECG pilot project, which involves more than 100  partners at national, regional and local levels – line ministries, agencies,  district administrations, municipalities, health, education and social  services providers, universities, NGOs, training institutions and many other  actors, has been critical for the strategic positioning of UNICEF as an  expert and partner of choice and has strengthened its convening role. Through its participation in the working group for the development of the  National Action Plan as well as in the monitoring committees for the  operational programmes, funded by ESF+, UNICEF was able to influence the key  national policies and interventions for child poverty reduction and to ensure  the sustainability and scaling up of the model services. The political  instability in the country, which continued throughout 2022, did affect the  implementation of the CG pilot project as UNICEF has secured the commitment  and active engagement of the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy and the CG  National Coordinator. A key factor for the successful testing of the model  services was the leading role of the municipalities and the establishment of  the coordination and monitoring committees at local level.
  
 Additionally, the EU Child Guarantee as an EC initiative aiming to ensure  that the most vulnerable children have access to healthcare,  education, childcare, decent housing and adequate nutrition, and targeting  the most vulnerable children with disabilities, in precarious family  situations, residing in institutions, migrant and refugee children, and Roma  children is a best practice of how to link our Humanitarian and Development  programming. Building on the experience of the EUCG pilot project, which  was implemented in 10 pilot municipalities in 3 districts – Burgas, Sliven  and Stara Zagora - the CO is  now expanding its existing partnerships with municipalities/regional  governments, to support access to social services for Ukrainian refugees and  is preparing model MoUs with the municipalities of Burgas, Varna, Sofia,  Plovdiv where most of the refugees are hosted.
  
 Throughout the Country Programme 2018-2022, and especially during and post COVID period, UNICEF invested in innovation and development of digital  platforms as useful tools to be integrated and sustained by the child related  system. For example, UNICEF has invested in expanding the access of  adolescent boys and girls to innovative and technology enabled mental health  services and strengthening its strategic positioning as convener, expert and  partner of choice in accelerating MHPSS priorities, building on increased  global and regional awareness and momentum. As an innovative approach Bebbo  parenting App was introduced in partnership with Ministry of Health and  Ministry of Education as a powerful digital parenting program for strengthening  the caregivers’ skills for provision of nurturing care. The App was launched  in June 2022 and it has been downloaded more than 24,000 times in just over 6  months. 
    The country office`s emergency response and all related resources has been  used to strengthen the national systems and seek for long –term sustainable  solutions. The emergency response is implemented in close collaboration with  national institutions and aims at strengthening organizational and  institutional capacity of national and local actors, improving the national  and local service delivery and management systems, and building the readiness  and resilience of national social protection systems, for longer term and sustainable results.  
  
  Additionally, UNICEF is working with both State Agency for Refugees and State Agency for Child Protection to strengthen the National Child Help Line for MHPSS service for vulnerable children and women as a first contact point to  share information about children at risk, including Ukrainian unaccompanied  children.  
  
 Internally, the office optimizes the use of L3 and L2 Emergency Procedures  which also implies capacity building and learning from RO, countries in the  region and strong support from management. The recently established Emergency  team (significantly funded by ORE) has been integrated in the regular  programming team. The Emergency response is entirely embedded into the  strategy, partnerships, and advocacy of regular programmes. The scale down is  prepared through full integration of emergency outputs into regular  programming, focus on system strengthening, and policy advocacy. 
  This programmatic shift, of downsizing the direct implementation of UNICEF and scaling up of the upstream work supported by the strong evidence was the  main strategy in 2022 and will be further elaborated in 2023. With a stabilization of the political situation in the country hopefully expected in 2023, UNICEF is positioned to have a significant role as technical advisor to the Government and continues to leverage resources for children.

ECAR,Croatia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"After the earthquake in Sisak-Moslavina County, UNICEF ensured the sustainability of the newly established Social and Cultural Centre in Petrinja, a platform cooperatively managed by the associations that founded the centre and which are their main beneficiaries. It is a good example of a civil-public partnership model with the City of Petrinja. In cooperation with key researchers on youth policies, UNICEF developed an innovative self-assessment tool to profile and measure adolescent and youth participation in public life. The tool was presented to partners and adolescents and successfully introduced as a part of the quality standards for the Youth Friendly Cities certificate (managed by the Central State Office for Demography and Youth, Institute for Social Research in Zagreb, Agency for Mobility and EU Programmes, youth organizations, Association of Cities in Croatia, and UNICEF Croatia). The tool will be adapted and scaled up for future use in other countries within Europe and Central Asia.
To ensure the most disadvantaged groups of children have access to basic services guaranteed by European Child Guarantee, CO brought together national and subnational authorities, academia, civil society organizations, local communities, parents and children in planning, monitoring and implementing of EU funded programme “Phase III. Testing of the Child Guarantee in Croatia”. UNICEF contributed to a strategic shift, from fragmented services across sectors to high-quality integrated services in the most deprived communities in Medjimurje, with a focus on the prevention of family disintegration and exclusion; from uniform to needs-based family interventions in a multicultural environment and from seeing kindergartens as a service for working parents to the right of every child. Moreover, in early intervention services, there has been a movement from too late, too few, isolated interventions to integrated early childhood interventions that adequately address children’s developmental needs. Also, five community resource centres - Centres for Children and Families were established and equipped to ensure that all the tested services across sectors are brought closer to the families within some of the most deprived communities in Croatia. High-level advocacy efforts of the CO were focused on ensuring the sustainability of Child Guarantee results. Thus, the line Ministry, Medjimurje County and partner municipalities agreed to establish a new Centre for the provision of services in the community.  This Centre will use the premises of the community resource centres for the provision of a family- and community-based services for children without adequate parental care and children with behavioural problems hence contributing to the deinstitutionalisation process. This is an example of a strategic shift towards targeted and evidence-based development of services as well as an excellent example of cooperation between national and subnational authorities. Additionally, this Centre
 will cooperate closely with the Office for Human Rights and Rights of National Minorities to address other needs of the most deprived Roma communities.  
To contribute to change in social behaviour towards children with disabilities in Croatia and gain donor support, CO created a unique and interactive advocacy and engagement concept, connecting the story about abilities, child rights, technology, lights, and entertainment by organizing the fifth edition of the Museum of Reality at the Festival of Lights, the second most visited event in the capital Zagreb. In the ""Largest sensory room in Croatia"", the Museum of Reality presented devices used by children with developmental disabilities and the experiences of blind and visually impaired children tell a unique story and break down stigma, discrimination, and invisible barriers for children with disabilities and their families. More than 20,000 visitors were able to feel, touch and experience the lights that help children with disabilities to engage in all aspects of life more easily, as equal members of society.
The final phase of the integrated campaign on mental health included a teaser-reveal part that encountered strong reactions on social media from one part of the public, with a short-term spillover to mainstream media. Negative comments about the messaging and execution of the teaser phase of the campaign by part of the expert community and public, demonstrated that a strong alliance of both traditional and non-traditional partners and experts around sensitive topics need to be created to ensure the success of campaigns targeting sensitive issues. The Office has readjusted its approach on the mental health campaign and programmes taking into consideration the experts’ feedback.  
An emergency of such magnitude, such as the war in Ukraine, resulted in the highest-ever financial support to a global humanitarian aid effort. However, economic uncertainty and inflation showed that donors were less ready to commit to monthly donations. It slowed down the expected growth for CO, but efforts will continue to diversify channels and target specific audiences less affected by the current circumstances. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic peak, UNICEF recognized the need to highlight the issue of gender-based violence and facilitated cross-sectoral work on prioritizing and addressing issues at system and intervention levels. 
Having in mind the intersectionality of gender-related issues, these aspects were consistently integrated throughout programmatic areas as a strategy to ensure that these are tackled across sectors and interventions.
UNICEF joined a working group on the Marketing of unhealthy foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children led by Croatian Institute for Public Health. Key stakeholders, including line ministries, Agency for Electronic Media, academia, and business representatives have been gathered to develop guidance ¿¿on restricting food and drink advertising aimed at children. The Country Office provided recommendations for policymakers and the business sector, thus contributing to the overall goal – multi-sectorial collaboration on creating an environment that facilitates proper food choices and obesity prevention in children. 
UNICEF took an active part in the annual Croatian Sustainability Conference in October and presented key UNICEF global and local achievements in child rights and business. The opportunity was used to further position children’s rights in the environmental, social and governance agenda, an especially important topic in EU countries where regulation is shaping the sustainability agenda and changing the way companies do business.

ECAR,"ECARO, Switzerland",Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In 2022, ECARO learned that as a region, it had the capacity to respond to an L3 emergency. One of its biggest strengths is the national staff, who were able to deploy quickly and understood the operating environment and were able to work through national structures to help scale the response.
 
The COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine crisis highlighted the central role of governments and the importance of cooperating with them closely in high- and middle-income countries to provide vital support in  addressing the crisis. Close coordination is required with a diversified pool of partners (including governments at national and decentralised levels, United Nations agencies, private businesses, civil society, Gavi, the Global Fund, and international financial institutions) to leverage their strengths and produce synergies. Better networked ways of working are required, involving development institutions, private companies, local communities, and new philanthropists – with skills, scale, access and sustainable business models (that UNICEF might not have in place).
 
Specifically, cooperation with UNHCR has been critical for advancing the advocacy agenda for protecting children, families and women. The  joint engagement has been well recognised by key national counterparts and the efforts to strengthen collaboration and synergies in the field.  
 
The escalation of the war in Ukraine highlighted the fragility of national child protection systems across the region, including in EU member states. The emergency response in Ukraine and neighbouring countries (including EU member states) has shown the importance of expanding and strengthening child protection systems to support various vulnerable groups that have struggled to cope with the sudden inflow of children in need of care and protection.
 
The Ukraine crisis again highlighted a gap in reliable data that can be quickly used and accessed. ECARO also learned that cross-border dimensions of the child protection agenda in the region continue to be significant and where UNICEF can add value. This includes the context of population movements related to the war in Ukraine, irregular migration flows, and the evacuation or transfer of children – whether from Iraq and Syria back to the region or the evacuations from Afghanistan - where UNICEF was asked to support UASC. 
 
The development of multiple products related to Ukraine and the refugee response was enabled by the regular sharing of information, development of templates, and orientation from the Emergency Situation Centre and humanitarian performance monitoring team to countries on reporting using intranet sites. It was also clear that the standard indicators for humanitarian response needed to be adjusted to be more attuned to working through national systems. 
Countries must assess the barriers and drivers influencing vaccine uptake to develop targeted interventions that can increase vaccination uptake. The resulting insights should inform the development of localised solutions designed with the participation of relevant stakeholders, including policymakers, health workers and caregivers. Additionally, to ensure their sustainability, assessments and solutions should be budgeted as part of the National Immunization Strategies. 
 
A lack of mechanisms to collect data on marginalised children, including Ukrainian refugee children and their educational situation, poses a challenge to reach out to these children, identify their needs, and design equity-focused programmes. ECARO will continue to advocate for the need to address data and information gaps with governments in the region and other partners.
 
ECARO launched a multi-country evaluation of deinstitutionalisation and childcare reform, which provides a unique opportunity for the region to capitalise on learning and experience and influence that will further support countries in the region to advance the deinstitutionalisation agenda. The range of papers (around the continuum of services) developed by ECARO will also encourage policy and practice development in countries.
 
Relevant and sustainable mechanisms for youth engagement and consultations continued to be required. The recent and ongoing crises in the region have disproportionately impacted youth, who need to be systematically engaged in issues affecting their lives through recognising them as leaders, influencers, motivators, peer educators and young experts. Both governments and multilateral partners recognise the power of engaging with youth to foster cross-country connections and inter-generational relationships to contribute towards more cohesive communities, countries and a region. This provides UNICEF with critical opportunities to strengthen its focus on youth programming and align the commitment to engage, connect and empower young people with crucial EU agendas. 
 
The selection of UNICEF to pilot the European Child Guarantee (ECG) in seven EU countries and the subsequent adoption of the Council Recommendation has created additional opportunities to advance the rights and protection of children. The ECG is an ambitious initiative that seeks to ensure that every child in Europe at risk of poverty and social exclusion has access to the essential services and support they need to thrive – a significant step towards realising the vision of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The ECG has been presented to governments outside the EU in the ECA Region and is being promoted as an approach to countries in the European Neighbourhood.
Efforts have been made to improve workplace culture. In 2022, the ECAR staff counsellor successfully piloted the development of Country Office Wellbeing Strategies in two countries (Uzbekistan and Türkiye) with the aim of embedding staff well-being in the country office framework.
Three digital tools were developed, resulting in efficiency gains for the Regional Operations teamwork and the clients the team serves and supports. The ECARO Procurement Workflow & Dashboard and budget monitoring reports have been successfully launched. At the same time, the last tool, the PBR chatbot, is finalised and waiting for final ICTD clearance for publishing. Once launched, the solution will be considered for other critical topics in the ECARO and the region (i.e., IP management, security, travel, etc.).

Country Office teams have highly appreciated the coordinated approach to CPD planning. As part of the CPD development process, the regional approach to developing programme rationales informed global guidelines.

ECAR,Georgia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons learned:
·        UNICEF continues to work with all stakeholders, regardless of political or religious affiliation. As a trusted and impartial partner, UNICEF was able to convene and facilitate constructive dialogue between parties, despite a polarized political environment. 
·        A child rights culture requires involvement of the entire society, including government officials, professionals working with children, community/religious leaders and academia, non-governmental organizations, donors and private sector. Stakeholders should be engaged early in programmes and should have targeted areas whereby they can learn, influence and enact change to benefit children.  
·        Interagency cooperation is a challenge and, therefore, involvement of high-level coordination mechanisms – the Inter-agency Commission on the Implementation of the CRC - helped to facilitate discussions and activate stakeholders. Moreover, focus on the best interests of the child at the heart of discussions allowed diverse stakeholders to unite around a common agenda, opening new pathways to bring various stakeholders together to engage on human and child rights. 
·        Cooperation with the executive branch of the Government, judiciary, local municipalities and the Parliament is imperative for the protection of children’s rights. It is important that coordination continues to be strengthened and links between these agencies as well as community, civil society and academia are improved. 
·        While many social responsibilities have moved from the central to local level, respective changes in normative acts have not been introduced; as a result, municipalities experience considerable difficulties to provide needed support to vulnerable citizens, including to Ukrainians currently residing in Georgia. 
·        A tailored approach to engaging different municipalities has been more effective, including careful targeting of decision-makers/management staff based on each municipality’s unique context, active engagement of high-level management and grouping municipalities for coordination/capacity building activities by certain similar characteristics, which enabled experience exchange and knowledge sharing between the municipalities facing similar challenges.
·        The actions implemented throughout the year were very complex, executed by multiple partners in a rapidly changing environment with significant changes in governance. It is important to engage a wide range of stakeholders, at varying levels, to help maintain momentum while new capacities are being built. 
·        Deployment of staff for the Ukrainian emergency response provided training and skills development for staff to better prepare for emergency responses locally.
·        Integrating data collection into the existing household surveys improves sustainability as well as allows for further analyses and disaggregation of child-related data by different social-economic variables. 
·        Social and behaviour change campaigns need to have measurable indicators identified at the beginning of the intervention, with baseline data collected, to allow for assessing the impact of the campaign. 
·        Lessons on how to better reflect on the Gender Action Plan should be taken forward including how to encourage engagement of fathers in children’s development and upbringing; as well as to strengthen the use of disaggregated data.     
 
 
Innovations: 
·        For emergency preparedness, alternative office facilities were previously rented so the space could be used if needed. A new approach is being used whereby UNICEF utilizes its existing partnerships with universities and upgrades identified space within the university premise which will be made available to UNICEF if/when an emergency appears. In the meantime, the space is utilized by the universities for classes and other learning initiatives.  
·        Introduction of restorative practices and mediation along with the strengthening of the social workforce in schools aims to establish practices and mechanisms for peaceful resolution of conflicts, which will contribute to the prevention of violence among and towards children in the schools and to the wellbeing of children and their families.  
·        The integrated service for child victims of sexual abuse uses an approach whereby justice and other systems work collaboratively to avoid re-victimization and re-traumatization of child victims of sexual abuse and supports their rehabilitation, thus putting child’s best interests in the very heart of investigative process. 
·        The study on goods and services required for participation of children with disabilities is an innovative pilot study that supports generation of detailed data on the additional support needs for inclusion and the extra costs for households. The methodology and findings were actively discussed with the disability community and relevant state actors to ensure ownership and acceptance, and shared with other countries to learn and apply similar models. 
·        The development of the web-portal for disability statistics will increase the use of such statistics as well as improve evidence-based decision-making. The portal will also contribute to the production of new statistical data on people/children with disabilities
·        The National Birth Registry was used only for surveillance and research, however, by adding perinatal service quality indicators, the Registry supports ongoing perinatal service quality monitoring. 
·        The water filtration system installed in Guria region is a new way to filter and sanitize water, at a competitive cost, and does not require electricity and chemicals. This allows for immediate water safety for children while advocacy continues for water quality to be addressed at the systemic level. 
·        The proposed environmental health (lead) surveillance system offers a novel method of microvolume capillary blood collection for lead testing, which is less stressful and invasive for children and also, does not require complicated storage and transportation logistics. 
·        The supportive supervision mechanism for PHC doctors applies international practices while at the same time innovating for country and health system context, types and levels of supervisors and supervised healthcare workers, the array of supervisory mechanisms, availability of platforms and etc. 
·        RTM/MICS Plus is a longitudinal, representative household survey tool with interviews conducted over the phone. It is designed to use the households from the MICS as its sample frame. While MICS Plus does not replace MICS, it provides opportunities for different data collection modalities measured with high frequency, which can be useful for emerging issues such as crisis monitoring. Georgia is among the first three countries globally utilizing MICS Plus.
 

"
ECAR,Greece,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The war in Ukraine affected NFE implementation with UNICEF and its partners adjusting presence and activities to support newly arrived refugee children at points of entry, dedicated camps and through online modalities. While an overall figure on the number of refugee and migrant children enrolled to formal education schools across Greece has been made available by the Ministry of Education, disaggregated data, such as the number of boys and girls enrolled in formal education remained a gap. UNICEF offered technical expertise to authorities to monitor the access, attendance and retention to school of refugee and migrant children, as well as to identify bottlenecks and provide solutions, corrective actions and relevant data to all stakeholders. However, no funding was identified to support this provision and the office will continue working towards identifying the necessary resources.
In child protection, the implementation of the pilot project of Child Guarantee in Greece remained an opportunity to support Government efforts on DI, reform of social services and the expansion of alternative family-based models of care. UNICEF’s future focus will be on scaling up implementation through advocacy, communication, and providing technical support to the State to bring upon all the required actions to reform the child protection system. In this effort, UNICEF should leverage resources from institutional and private funding streams and steer the public narrative towards this goal. In addition, CP/GBV programming for refugees and migrants was constraint due to lack of funding through HAC and EU funding mechanisms; UNICEF strived to strengthen prevention activities for the protection of children through the ACE.
The launch of U-Report Greece presents an opportunity for scale-up by engaging directly with and empowering youth across the country. Among the challenges encountered was the limited capacity and expertise of local partners on youth participation and empowerment, as well as the difficulty to reach large numbers of vulnerable youth from refugee and Roma communities. To address this, UNICEF increased face-to-face outreach to refugee youth and advocated for uptake of the U-Report by local and national authorities.
With regards to social policy and child rights monitoring, one major constraint is related to the limited capacity and expertise of local governments in monitoring, data collection and reporting, and the lack of existing child-focused municipal Action Plans. Local governments also lack effective internal coordination mechanisms and require detailed guidance and continuous, personalized support by UNICEF for them to coordinate and monitor social services locally. Significant efforts and resources need to be put into building the capacities of local staff to empower them to perform these functions and serve as catalyzers in their communities.
Clear programmatic priorities and initiatives need to be in place prior to reaching out to influential figures as most are keen to stand behind an existing programme/campaign. To promote a lasting cooperation, it is important to have internal capacity and dedicated time to build strong relationships with each key high profile individual in order to deliver a personalized and targeted plan for communications engagement. Two LTAs on media clippings and social media listening allowed the office to thoroughly monitor and evaluate communication and advocacy efforts.
Programme effectiveness is based on an alignment of advocacy, fundraising and programmatic priorities. Significant efforts were undertaken to boost resource mobilization through public partnerships under EU instruments funds channeled through the Government in order for UNICEF to play an active role in the implementation of interventions included in recent policy frameworks, such as the Child Guarantee NAP. Such efforts will need to be intensified to scale up of current initiatives, and for large-scale service delivery. Establishing governance and coordination structures under UNICEF’s flagship initiatives can address fragmentation, division of accountabilities and lack of synergies among actors, as well as, to encourage ownership of results and help advance the child rights agenda. 
The office continued efforts to improve internal capacity to maximize operational effectiveness, transitioning from downstream to upstream work, implementing projects of high complexity and value, and administering EU grants with strict conditionalities while trying to build a self-funding model.  Developing a self-funding model that will lead to financial stability requires strategic planning of financial and human resources, which requires positioning of Operations’ role from transactional to a strategic partner in programme development and implementation.
Public and private resource mobilization for the Office took place against a difficult socioeconomic environment. The unstable economic situation of the country, exacerbated by a health and energy crisis, has affected the financial security of Greek citizens and businesses. In addition, the war in Ukraine has attracted the attention of media, donors and EU decision makers, while Greece is no longer grappling with an emergency.
Securing funding for projects that focus on system-strengthening, such as violence against children (VAC) and justice workplans, proved difficult as donors are more familiar with a project-based approach. Meanwhile, allegations of NGOs involved in child abuse and fraud affect the overall sentiment and trust towards the sector which, in turn, affects fundraising efforts. This may also present an opportunity for UNICEF to position itself as a transformational agency for the promotion of children rights and also help enhance resource mobilization efforts. A campaign on results can be the starting point to build the trust of individuals and private sector prospects in the Organization and its work, especially given the tainted legacy and image of the UNICEF brand caused by the closure of the former National Committee.
Finally, and most importantly, UNICEF invested significant resources in 2022 to support the Ministry of Health to develop two nationwide programs to be supported through funding from the National Managing Authority of the Recovery and Resilience Fund (RRF). However, institutional constraints pertaining to UNICEF’s regulatory framework in receiving and managing funds received from the Greek State will need to be addressed for these efforts to bear positive results. The resolution of these administrative and legal barriers preventing UNICEF from accessing fiscal resources of a range of EU financing instruments should be considered an existential challenge for the sustainability and viability of a Country Office in an EU member state."
ECAR,Kazakhstan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Promoting comprehensive and integrated health approaches
 
National authorities adapted healthcare systems to COVID-19 viral mutations to address intensified typical respiratory infections. A widespread vaccination program among adults and adolescents drove this change. The healthcare system is gradually returning from a survival-based approach to a thrive-based agenda. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of primary healthcare in ensuring quality healthcare provision to people in both non-emergencies and healthcare crises. The health sector cannot resolve public health issues alone, especially when it comes to children's health, where cross-sectoral collaboration among education, social protection, and other sectors is crucial. 
Building on its emergency-response experience, including COVID-19 and during the tragic events in January, UNICEF is supporting evidence-based updates to the Universal Progressive Patronage Model (UPMP). Introduced into Primary Health Care (PHC) organizations in 2019,  but hindered by COVID-19 with subsequent pressure on Primary health Care. In 2022, UNICEF also successfully encouraged the Government to develop an integrated child healthcare vision. Overall, investment made on research - tackling both demand and supply sides for universal immunization, along with extensive local experts’ mobilization, and consensus building dialogue with authorities, helped identifying gaps and developing a comprehensive Roadmap for immunization system strengthening.
 
Expanding youth’s access to skills programmes 
 
Blended learning (online/offline) formats were instrumental in expanding access to youth skills programmes in 2022. Youth Resource Centres and schools around Kazakhstan increasingly favored the Upshift/Samgau blended skills programme, which adolescents found more attractive because it involves in-person interactions and mentoring. Anchoring the programme to the ‘Learning Passport’ digital platform was a cost-effective approach to engaging students from schools in rural areas. The number of Samgau digital platform users increased threefold in 2022, requiring programmers to develop a digital application for launch in early 2023.
 
Strengthening child rights monitoring
 
The Kazakhstan Country Office continued investing in meaningful research and evaluation efforts. Experience dictates that building evidence-based national commitments requires early-stage development of sound dissemination plans and targeted advocacy strategies for critical stakeholders. UNICEF successfully opened dialogues with national authorities about expanding the child rights monitoring framework, developed in the Region, to compare evidence-based statistics with national commitments, develop result-based policies, and inform future programmes. 
The Prime Minister's office endorsed the Child Well-Being Index, developed with UNICEF support, in close cooperation with the Child Rights Protection Committee and the Institute of Economic Research. The Index represents a major national innovation, as it consists of 56 indicators used to monitor the status of children’s rights in Kazakhstan. The process for developing the set of indicators and a calculation methodology is complex, as it must ensure not only comprehensive and accurate monitoring, but also efficiency and sustainability. As such, UNICEF partnered with the BNS to review data sources and collection methods and develop an online dashboard to monitor children’s well-being regionally.  
 
Promoting public financing for children
 
With UNICEF support, the Government successfully integrated child budget monitoring into the new Child Well-Being Index to track public spending for children. This work revealed significant gaps in child-specific public expenditure tracking methods. Incomplete child sensitiveness of the data generated by central and local authorities prevents a comprehensive analysis of public expenditures for children. Moving the child budget initiative forward requires significative investments to build internal systems to track child-focused public allocations and expenditures and strong national commitments on public spending for children. UNICEF continues consulting with the Government to develop long-term plans for child-specific budgeting and spending. 
 
Engaging through new digital platforms
 
Opening UNICEF’s TikTok channel and establishing an innovative partnership with TikTok created a tremendous opportunity to directly access adolescents not otherwise reached through Instagram and Facebook. Organizing a summer camp with adolescents and youth to produce TikTok content for UNICEF’s new channel further promoted youth engagement. Producing and maintaining dynamic, targeted, and high-quality content in accordance with TikTok trends necessitates additional investments.  
UNICEF Kazakhstan activated its donation page to raise funds for the Ukraine appeal. Using global digital assets, the Country Office promoted the donation page through its social media platforms. As a result, the page received a high volume of traffic and positive public feedback. Individual givers highlighted the need to modify the donation page to reflect local practices for financial transactions, as Credit cards are not widely used in Kazakhstan and people instead almost universally use the Kaspi platform to make electronic payments. Successful digital fundraising relies on locally adapted platforms and strong brand communication strategies. 
 
Building evidence and addressing gender-balanced parenting 
 
While conducting a knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) survey on early childhood developmental monitoring, several target groups were a hard to reach, including parents expecting their first child, parents/caregivers of children with disabilities aged 0–7, and fathers. These difficulties likely resulted from cultural practices, such as the delicate and private nature of first-time pregnancies in Kazakhstan and the prevalence of traditional gender roles in childrearing. This bottleneck highlights the continued importance of UNICEF’s work to promote gender-equal parenting and more in-depth qualitative analyses in this area. "
ECAR,Kosovo (UN SC resolution 1244),Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons-learned across programme areas informed planning and implementation during 2022 and/or beyond. In the health area, the costing tool for the HV programme proved effective for Ministry of Health’s advocacy at central level and contributed to increased public funding for the programme. At municipal level UNICEF is using the tool to support budget planning, in response to capacity gaps identified in the planning and use of funds. Capacity to manage and absorb budgets at local level appears as a common bottleneck across sectors, and support provided to health institutions in this area will also be useful in other sectors such as education, where often available budgets for specific areas such as early education or children with disabilities, are not requested or remain unused due to limited capacities. 
Despite sustained investments in strengthening the outreach capacities of the primary health care system through HV, the number of children identified with developmental delays remains concerningly low in Kosovo. To respond to this challenge UNICEF and the health authorities have now agreed to develop a standardized child developmental monitoring tool, starting in 2023, that will be integrated into the PHC. 
With authorities shifting attention from COVID-19 towards other public health priorities in the second half of 2022, interventions related to vaccine uptake required significant advocacy and strategic engagement with health institutions. UNICEF advocated for formal approval of the RCCE Action Plan, which was eventually agreed to be integrated within the National Immunization Plan, developed earlier in the year, and approved and adopted in November by the Ministry of Health. Embedding RCCE in the National Immunization Plan provides an opportunity for building on developed capacities and strategies that could be used in the future to more effectively enhance vaccine demand overall, including for new vaccines that will be introduced to the routine immunization programme in upcoming years. New evidence-based interventions to address misinformation around COVID-19 were tested, including intensified and tailored messaging  and pop-up vaccination sites in city centers and strategic locations such as summer festivals targeting young people, based on the analysis of vaccination data by age group which showed significantly lower vaccination rates among this group. While these efforts increased access to information and vaccination sites, overall impact of such interventions appears limited, as there was no visible increase in vaccination rates.
In the area of digital learning, despite commitment and efforts from central level institutions, use of Shkollat.org and other digital tools at the local level has decreased due to the return to in-person teaching and learning, the lack of digital infrastructure in schools, and the limited pedagogical and ICT skills of teachers necessary to transform emergency practices into sustained inclusive pedagogical approaches. UNICEF has learned the importance of working closely with education authorities at multiple levels to strengthen the enabling environment by influencing policies for the development of digital ecosystems in schools, while also promoting awareness and providing direct upskilling and support to teachers. Promoting the involvement of children and adolescents in the process is key, especially considering their often already strong engagement and interest in digital skills.
An end project assessment of UNICEF’s three-year project on enhancing adolescents’ and young people’s 21st century skills concluded that the piloting in 2021-2022 of skills-based programmes as part of the upper-secondary school curriculum, provided a good foundation for scaling up of the programmes in the future.  In addition, the approach proved to be effective in contributing to local awareness and understanding of the importance of skills-based learning. However, while bringing the skills-based development programmes into the secondary school subject-classrooms has been a successful entry point, the assessment also suggested that this approach alone is insufficient for effectively integrating skills-programmes in formal education or making them sustainable, and recommends the use of additional entry points going forward, such as specific skills-based subjects and/or skills-based extra-curricular activities in the school setting.
Municipalities and Centers for Social Work are mandated to manage the provision of social services, yet their capacity to do so remains very limited, which hampers the quality of services. Centers for Social Work have faced considerable difficulties due to the lack of human and financial resources and limited professional capacities. In this context, adequate financing of social services remains a challenge. While the government has rightly prioritized cash subsidies, including new grants targeting families and children, in its economic recovery package following the pandemic, longer-term reform of the social assistance schemes is required to ensure they are sustainably financed, improve targeting and enhance their poverty-reducing impact for families, as well as ensuring closer integration of social assistance with social services. 
The authorities in Kosovo declared 2022 as the Year of Disability, which has increased both the public’s and institutions’ awareness and attention on the importance of the inclusion of children and other persons with disabilities. The legislative reform process and provision of quality services for persons with disabilities, however, require additional efforts and resources to translate this significant political commitment into sustained results.
Regarding partnerships, The Team Rijad initiative was an innovative way to create and leverage multi-stakeholder partnerships to address unmet needs. UNICEF provided “behind the scenes” support to help young advocate Rijad Mehmeti’s create the Team Rijad advocacy platform for the inclusion of children living with disabilities. Team Rijad engaged the President of Kosovo, high-profile influencers, journalists, private sector companies and children with disabilities from all walks of life and focused on a visible and measurable goal: improved physical access to community and school facilities and for an increased number of teacher assistants for children with disabilities. In its first year Team Rijad partnered with ten private sector businesses – particularly construction companies – to install ramps and build accessible toilets so that children with physical disabilities can attend schools. This led to the construction of 4 ramps and 9 toilets across 6 municipalities as in-kind donations, contributing directly to the overall improvement of learning environments for children with disabilities as well as bringing greater awareness of inclusive education issues to the public in Kosovo.

"
ECAR,Moldova,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The Ukraine emergency overshadowed the Covid-19 pandemic 
The uptake of vaccines by the general population has been slowing down since the epidemiological situation improved in February 2022 and as the government relaxed COVID-19 related restrictions. Against that backdrop, the war in Ukraine and the ensuing refugee crisis shifted the public attention away from the pandemic. Moreover, the uptake of vaccines among certain groups (adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding women, young parents) remained low, as it was before the Ukraine emergency. 

To find out what are the prevailing demand-side barriers to vaccination, UNICEF conducted a qualitative study on ""Perceptions, Attitudes and Beliefs on the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine in the Republic of Moldova"". The findings revealed that misinformation and disinformation spread primarily through social media caused vaccine hesitancy by spreading unscientific and unsubstantiated information about the effects of the vaccine. The study also revealed that medical professionals were trusted but unable to convey the information in a proper way. 
UNICEF supported the development of clear and concise information leaflets and brochures, and engaged in trainings for health professionals to be able to inform various groups of people such as those with certain chronic diseases, teenagers and their parents, etc. To tackle vaccine hesitancy, UNICEF addresses the rumors, fake news and vaccine scares through innovative social listening and myth debunking methods. The presence of a high number of Ukrainian refugees in Moldova required that informational materials be adjusted and translated into Ukrainian and disseminated through the Blue Dots, Refugee Accommodation Centers , and social media.  

Considering that the pandemic is likely to continue well into 2023, UNICEF will continue to implement innovative activities to address vaccine hesitancy, building on the experiences and lessons learned from its programmes and those of our partners. 
 
 
Human resources management in Emergency
The Ukraine refugee crisis triggering the relevant L3/L2 simplified procedures, along with experience gained during the COVID-19 pandemic, have allowed the office to quickly adapt the existing HR practices and leverage the organizational tools both in programmes and operations. Operating for the first time under an L3 humanitarian emergency, the office moved quickly and timely to identify human resources gaps and needed skill sets to ensure immediate launch and further scaling-up of humanitarian action in response to the Ukrainian refugee crisis. The office received substantial and highly appreciated support from the Regional Office in this regard, which was especially relevant with the approval of the proposed emergency human resources structure completed in a record time, with wide application of L2/L3 procedures and simplifications.  While the recruitments for the new human resources structure have been underway, the office significantly benefited from surge deployments from NYHQ, Regional and Country offices, which has been an essential tool to ensure the immediate ‘gear-shift’ for the office and immediate launch of the humanitarian response activities at scale, as well as establishment of the related inter-agency coordination from the onset of the crisis.  

Two important lessons were noted; critical to effective management of surge deployments and subsequent change in the human resources structure of the office, required for planning, coordination and implementation of the emergency response – which occur at the same time – have been immediate availability of experienced staff and their expertise and skills relevant to the programmatic context of Moldova. On both fronts, the office has been able to benefit well with most of the deployments. This has been particularly relevant when it comes to having sufficient number of staff at senior level with the requisite experience and it proved to be essential to position UNICEF as a lead agency in child protection, education and WASH very early on. To facilitate and expedite onboarding, a ‘Country Specific Guide’ was developed and shared in advance with surge and IP staff, providing information and instructions in support of their deployment and reassignment arrangements.  To support the integration process of new recruits into the office, an Induction Portal was launched – the page includes useful instructions, documents and links providing guidance for first months of service, and beyond.


Working along the Humanitarian-Development Nexus
At the onset of the Ukraine war, UNICEF Moldova was finalizing the preparation of the new Country Programme of Cooperation 2023-2027 (CPD 2023-2027). The document was about to be consulted with national stakeholders when the refugee crisis derailed the plans and required rethinking of the programme approach to ensure that humanitarian action for children is strengthened and mainstreamed in the document. 
 
Rather than opting for an extension of the old Country Programme, UNICEF Moldova agreed with the Regional Office, in close consultations and partnership with other UN agencies, to include the humanitarian action for children into the structure of the 2023-2027 CPD, focusing on enabling delivery of humanitarian action for Ukrainian refugees, including life-saving supplies and essential protection and humanitarian assistance, through national systems, while at the same time working to strengthen the system capacities for improved quality of services as well as its resilience and shock-responsiveness. 
 
The already existing internal structure and coordination within the office reflected this approach, fostering and adhering to the principle of one programme and one operations, under the overall leadership of the Country Representative - instead of establishing separate humanitarian and development programme and operations structures. The expanded programme and operations teams were unified under the leadership of section chiefs, with clear accountabilities for planning and implementing activities that address the needs of refugees while continuously strengthening national system capacities for inclusive and effective delivery of services. This approach has been also reflected in the office communication, advocacy and fundraising activities. 
 
This approach has ensured that the delivery of UNICEF Programme in Moldova is at the humanitarian-development nexus from the onset of the crisis, enabling that UNICEF primary role in delivering on its humanitarian action for children is performed through national systems for children and that national systems capacity development is at the center of UNICEF humanitarian response strategy. The effectiveness of the MLSP MoU that embodies this approach became a model touted by the minister at high-level meeitngs and adopted by other UN agencies.

"
ECAR,North Macedonia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF utilized climate change as an entry point to expand experiential learning practices thus contributing to both quality education and environmental sustainability results. More than 100 teachers, mostly women from schools across the country gained new knowledge on integrating experiential learning activities for climate change and environment in preschool and primary education. Over 10,000 children (8% of total children in that age range) experienced these activities guided by the teachers. It is expected that experiential learning in the long run will be a foundational process to contribute to the increasing number of female environmental scientist and engineers as part of the green economy transition. Handbook with the experiential learning activities for environment and climate change for preschool and primary education was developed and adapted for children with disabilities (hearing and visual impairments, and developmental delays). It was also observed that children with disabilities were actively involved in the experiments making experiential learning a strong tool to support their inclusion.  In addition, the framework for the network of science centers was developed to support the implementation of science curricula in the education system based on experiential learning thus also supporting girls in STEM agenda. 
 
Early intervention for children with disabilities was promoted by the introduction of localized version of Cboard communicator. In 2022, UNICEF adapted and launched localized versions of the communicator Cboard, a free digital application that offers children, parents, teachers and therapists the ability to create communication boards using a range of symbols or other personalized images with added labels in the language required. Users then create messages that are read out using local language text-to-speech engines in Macedonian and Albanian. The app can be used in many settings, starting from the child’s family and preschool, early intervention centers, schools, resource centers and speech therapy services, to support the early childhood development and inclusion of children with disabilities, from preschool education onwards. Cboard and the capacity-development of professionals on using alternative and augmentative communication (AAC) have helped professionals re-consider the communication approach, how it can be stimulated and assisted, emphasizing the importance of early identification and early intervention.
 
Inclusion of young people from the Educational correctional facility in a joint initiative with other children greatly contributed to efforts of changing punitive behaviors amongst professionals. During 2022 a tailored J4C programme for child and youth advocates was developed in which 60 youth, including ones from small group homes and correctional facilities – who are overrepresented by boys from ethnic minorities, especially Roma - were trained to strengthen their advocacy skills and innovate new mechanisms and solutions that facilitate access and quality of J4C. Among others, the above approach also contributed to the discontinuation of the sentence of children from correctional facility, and four out of five young people (from a total of 18 young people in the ECF) that were included in the programme were released in the course of the programme as their participation was used as an additional argument by the professionals when issuing a positive opinion for release. Their participation in high-level stakeholder events with Ministers, the Ombudswoman for children, prosecutors, judges, social workers led to professionals advocating for the initiatives that the children have presented. 
 
Multi-sectoral intervention in response to the needs of Afghan evacuees temporarily relocated to North Macedonia enabled the detection of systemic gaps and access the response capacities of CSOs to possible refugee crisis. Responding to an urgent request to support Afghan evacuees in North Macedonia, UNICEF developed and successfully implemented an extremely complex yet inter-sectoral programme to Afghan children and women ensuring their health, education, and protection services including psycho-social support and legal assistance. Thanks to the great partnership with the donor – USAID, the programme underwent numerous adjustments to adapt to fluctuating number of beneficiaries and varying support schemes from their employees-US CSOs, in ensuring the most relevant support to the needs of Afghan population. There were targeted activities aimed at prevention and response of gender-based violence, including focus group discussions, MHPSS sessions, development of guidelines for prevention of GBV and an integrated program with gender/age/disability specifications for established child and youth-friendly spaces.  While the inter-sectoral programme in response to Afghan evacuees cannot be compared with large-scale response programmes the lessons learned during the implementation especially those related to ensuring ‘continuum of support’ for children on the move irrespective of jurisdiction i.e country, were shared regionally and will be further used to inform the organizational experience on that matter.
 
Recognizing the negative effects of pandemic on routine immunization, UNICEF proactively supported the national systems to increase vaccine uptake. Anecdotal evidence suggests that COVID-19 seriously disrupted the routine immunization system during the past 2 years. UNICEF supported the development of catch-up immunization strategy, multimedia campaigns, social and behavioral interventions to ensure access to vaccine to every child. When designing the national campaign UNICEF purposely targeted mothers through the messaging and delivery methods considering the evidence of their decision-making role in vaccination. Among others, the interventions included an online social listening component and an expert panel made up of key members of relevant national committees, media representatives and fact checkers. The expert panel analyzed findings of online social listening and developed engagement recommendations to respond to emerging issues. Based on the practical application of the system, a strategy on how to integrate the misinformation management within the work of national institutions was developed. Lessons learned through these engagements suggest that campaigns and demand side interventions should go together with efforts to build capacities of national authorities to address vaccine hesitancy and be based on current behavioral insights to increase chances of influencing decision making. The integrated approach provided credibility to support advocacy on the need for strengthening national systems to address vaccine hesitancy with the National Immunization Committee agreeing to formalize the misinformation management system.

ECAR,Poland,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF Poland's response to the Ukrainian refugee influx has been unique, depicting good example of scaling up a response in a limited timeframe among myriad of challenges.

UNICEF has been working in low, middle, and upper middle-income countries, guided by well-established emergency systems and procedures to respond and scale up emergency response, including pre-positioning stock. However, working in a high-income country such as Poland with a strong government and service delivery mechanisms in place provided opportunities to fast tracking  the refugee response. EU's legal and regulatory framework and Poland's country-specific practices required a thorough understanding of the rules of Engagement and the operational context surrounding the refugee response  wherein UNICEF was able to tap-in the capacity of the national and regional governments combining with its technical expertise. 

UNICEF Poland’s work has been a unique, providing avenues for working through national systems with strong governance experience in other high-income countries. Poland, a non-CPD country , posed initial challenges to rolling out its emergency response due to unavailability of the basic cooperation agreement in place. UNICEF adopted an approach of engaging with the government both at the central and municipal levels to understand and manure through the complex political relationships between municipalities – the main arm of Polish state service delivery to its citizens – and the central government. UNICEF capitalized upon the existing systems and worked with the municipalities to expand its refugee response. Working with municipalities in areas with a concentration of refugees has been pivotal in reaching out to the refugee population. Through signing the letter of Engagement, UNICEF partnered with 12 municipalities leveraging upon their existing service delivery mechanism, expediting the response and ensuring sustainability as some of the investments have been made at the institutional level into the systems. 
 
The operational presence in the field locations facilitated coordination with various government entities and helped coordinate the response with other actors such as UNHCR, IOM, WHO and IRC. 
 
UNICEF Poland received technical support, and surge staff to help with the initial response; however, as the response moved into the sustained phase, UNICEF began to recruit new staff to augment its capacity and ensure the suitability of its response. Engaging staff for this response proved unexpectedly challenging due to constrained labour markets for the national staff comparatively, low salary rates compared to the private sector and high cost of living for the international staff. Several actions have been taken to sustain the staff's well-being, including a salary survey for international staff. 
 
Due to the mobility of the refugee population, alternative education opportunities helped to maintain and adapt education and care services to children on the move ensuring flexibility and geographical mobility.  
 
UNICEF's Refugee Response in Poland will continue in 2023 with some adaptations and re-organization of the priorities vis-à-vis considering any potential influx of refugees due to the escalation of the conflict in Ukraine.

ECAR,Rep of Uzbekistan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Emerging opportunities and innovations: 
    
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Uzbekistan's health system, particularly its immunization system, showed great resilience and agility, e.g., minimal backsliding in routine immunization. On the other hand, some weaknesses were revealed by the crisis, including substandard temperature monitoring and vaccine management practices, a nonexistent electronic immunization registry linked to the civil registry, and obsolete medical waste management infrastructure. UNICEF leveraged resources for the COVID-19 response to address those bottlenecks and strengthen the immunization system by deploying remote temperature monitoring systems in all national and sub-national vaccine warehouses, developing and rolling out a vaccine logistics management and information system, creating an electronic immunization registry and an electronic knowledge hub for healthcare workers; strengthening the medical waste management infrastructure; and revising relevant national policies and guidelines.   

Poorly managed healthcare waste remains an issue in Uzbekistan. The findings of UNICEF supported the first waste management assessment showed the need to improve policy and practices to eliminate indirect and direct risk factors to human health and the environment. A waste management strategy, action plan, and urban and rural waste management models and standards were designed with UNICEF support. As a model, UNICEF procured hospital healthcare waste sterilization equipment for six pilot district hospitals and consumables for one year of operation. Additionally, UNICEF constructed 22 climate-friendly healthcare waste management buildings and aligned healthcare waste management policies and operating procedures with international standards and best practices. As a result, the country has a tested framework for medical waste management for scale-up. 

Lessons learned: 
    
There is high-level political commitment to child protection, as evidenced by the recent commitment to expedite the deinstitutionalization of the childcare system and the exemplary commitment to repatriate and reintegrate children from armed conflict zones, however, less consistent commitment to child protection systems strengthening (CPSS). The absence of a single ministry or agency where child and family welfare is situated, and the constant restructuring of relevant ministries and institutions, complicates things further. In this context, it remains crucial to continue advocating for CPSS at the national level and to extend support in advancing legal and policy frameworks and strengthening national governance and coordination structures. 

The UNICEF-managed evaluation of the UN Joint Programme on Social Protection reconfirmed a requirement for a clear intervention logic of how supported efforts can deliver outputs with transformative potential and a realistic resource strategy. Another lesson highlighted that the achievement of longer-term strategic objectives is based on cooperation with the Government and a commitment to adopt an appropriate set of policies, legislative and institutional reforms sequenced in a way to incrementally build the national capacity over a longer-term horizon. The lessons learnt from the evaluation were discussed by UNICEF and national partners and addressed in management response actions, including a proposal for funding. 

Even though there is no single institution responsible for overall social protection issues, the availability of an Integrated Management Information System (the Single Registry) allowed for the expansion of cash assistance and services to a wider population. As UNICEF is the GoU’s key partner for strengthening the Single Registry, the system has a strong focus on children and women. UNICEF decided to use this comparative advantage to also incorporate shock responsive and emergency modules, as well as needs-based assessment for case management, into the Single Registry. Furthermore, the needs-based assessment will also be applicable to assess the needs of those affected by different shocks and will allow the Government to develop tailored responses. 

Detrimental gender norms remain a key barrier to the full realization of girls’ potential, their engagement in skills-building programmes and realization of entrepreneurship solutions. UNICEF needs to undertake a gender norms analysis and support the design and implementation of an evidence-based social behaviour change campaign.  

Girls and women with disabilities face double discrimination and are also more likely to be excluded. Focusing on gender equality and women’s empowerment is an important step to accelerate achieving the SDGs. This can be done by ending discrimination against women and improving their labour force participation. As part of the Skills4Girls programme, gender and disability inclusion sessions were conducted with role models for girls’ leadership and empowerment to raise awareness of harmful gender norms, the importance of STEM and disability-inclusive communication. The programme has demonstrated at the policy level the importance of investments into inclusive learning platforms for persons with disabilities to empower them and expand their educational and employment prospects, which requires procurement of assistive technology and awareness raising to combat stigma and discrimination towards persons with disabilities.   

Noting that Uzbekistan is observing increased impacts of natural and climate-related disasters in 2022, the Country Office was able to enhance disaster preperedness through emergency supply prepositioning, investing in developing relevant tools and mechanisms for child-centered and gender-responsive interventions. Moreover, it has managed to effectively respond to floods in Jizzakh region, which was possible thanks to the availability of the contingency partnership agreement with the Red Crescent Society. 
"
ECAR,Republic of Kyrgyzstan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"During the country programme (CP) 2018-2022, special efforts were made to improve policy-maker and service provider capacity to listen to public suggestions, concerns and feedback, especially from children, adolescents and youth. UNICEF also endeavoured to enable children and youth to meaningfully participate in public discussions and decision-making. UNICEF also further shifted its own business model from working for to working with children and youth, consulting them on the framing of the 2023-2027 CP and mainstreaming child participation across results areas. 
 
Social listening is new in Kyrgyzstan and was initially poorly understood by partners. First reports were seen as criticizing state and civil service performance. However, in the COVID-19 response, UNICEF and the Republican Health Promotion and Mass Communication Centre (RHPMCC) continues its use to gain a real understanding of the population’s concerns, improving the findings presentation to make it more constructive and solution oriented. For six months, social listening reports were only used internally. However, the Centre started using the data at Ministry of Health (MoH) meetings to tailor communications on vaccines. Eventually, weekly social listening reports were shared with all COVID-19 Communication Group members, including development partners. With time, interest in social listening grew among state partners at technical and policy levels. 
 
Social listening data was collected online and offline. The RHMPCC organized website and social media polls, and surveyed village health committees every week by telephone. A group of analysts reviewed popular social network posts and comments, monitored media reports and developed recommendations. 
 
Together with behavioural insights, social listening data helped shape public communication on vaccination, respond to information voids, and debunk myths. It was also used build public trust, as distrust in public authorities was identified as a primary reason for low vaccination. UNICEF also supports health-care providers to be open to user feedback. Training on interpersonal communication and home visiting for medical workers emphasizes the importance of active listening and motivational interviewing for childhood immunization and COVID-19 vaccination counselling.

In the spirit of social listening, the digital platform U-report was created with UNICEF support in November 2021, under the Ministry of Culture, Information, Sports and Youth, to collect young people’s feedback and opinions; vital as almost half Kyrgyzstan’s population is under 25. In 2022, U-report reached 15,077 subscribers and was used to get youth perspectives on the “Kyrgyz Jarany” social cohesion policy of the government, as part of peacebuilding work.  Just over half were aware of this policy, but 75 per cent wanted to know more. A third wanted to help introduce the Concept through projects. A fifth felt they could learn about it at school or work. U-report was also used to ask youth about their education priorities to feed into national consultations for the global United Nations Transforming Education Summit. Ninety-two per cent believed government should do more to ensure children learn basic literacy and numeracy at primary school. These inputs were taken into account for Kyrgyzstan’s commitment presented at the Summit.
 
During 2022, UNICEF and other United Nations agencies, initiated hate speech monitoring using an automated system to identify key words. The first two monthly reports confirmed that increased isolation and discontent along ethnic, geographic, generational, gender and other lines led to increased hate speech. The September 2022 Kyrgyz-Tajik border conflict sparked more hate speech on social media involving public figures. UNICEF will further analyse and use the data to prevent such intolerant discourse. 

UNICEF advocated for use of feedback tools in humanitarian response, after the cross-border conflict with Tajikistan, following United Nations guidance on Accountability to Affected Populations. Thus, UNICEF-supported civil society, local radio and village health committees, reached 500,000 members of displaced families and host communities with child health and well-being information. They organized live radio programmes with specialists and authorities. Radio discussions became a key mechanism for affected persons to openly raise issues related to the assistance received.  

During the current CP, UNICEF focused on enhancing local-level adolescent and youth participation through the Youth-and-Child-Friendly Local Governance (YCFLG) initiative in 42 localities across all seven provinces. Under YCFLG, youth councils were established under each mayor’s office, to identify key issues and address them in local planning and budgeting processes . YCFLG has crucially addressed limited youth engagement and poor social cohesion. Parent groups, schools and local governments support youth projects and proposals. Projects include designing and placing rubbish bins in towns, opening a student library, public events on inclusion of children with disabilities, and adding streetlights and pavements around schools. In 2019, the Government starting leading YCFLG, with UNICEF support, transforming it into a two-yearly competition. A second round initiated in 2022 will reach all 32 localities. However, local authorities did not fully embrace youth participation principles and standards. In 2022, UNICEF helped develop a training module for local officials on engaging adolescents in participatory governance. This will be rolled-out in 2023. 
 
UNICEF strived to ensure youth voices could also feed into its new programme. UNICEF consulted three groups of disadvantaged adolescent girls and boys – adolescents with disabilities, girls from conservative communities and adolescents from the marginalized Roma (Lyuli) community – presenting new CP priorities, and discussing their specific needs. The consultations confirmed the importance of co-creating solutions and programme approaches tailored to adolescents’ specific barriers and challenges, and the need for an enabling environment alongside service provision and skills development. 
 
As a result, the new Country Programme mainstreams child and youth participation in all programmes, beyond the specific adolescent development and participation (ADAP) output. In upcoming interventions, UNICEF will focus even more on youth participation, at levels from communities and families, schools, local government, to central authorities.
 
Integrating youth perspectives in programme development is a must, as UNICEF cannot implement adolescent and youth programmes without having them at the table.  In the second phase of “Girls in Science” project, an indicator is included to measure girl peer trainers’ satisfaction with programme activities and their degree of participation in design, implementation and monitoring. A guide will be co-developed to integrate this in implementing partners’ work in 2023.

ECAR,Republic of Montenegro,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Montenegro has been facing significant political instability, including the fall of two governments in the last two years, a dysfunctional judiciary, and significant shifts in the staff structure at the levels of decision making and middle management. Additionally, the functioning of most of the institutions was practically paralysed for three months due to the cyber-attach on the Government’s IT systems. This prolonged situation was a continuous threat to the child rights agenda and the overall human rights and rule of law agenda. UNICEF continuously applied a professional, knowledge-based and neutral approach, rooted in international standards and commitments on child rights to support the country to sustain the results achieved so far and foster continuation of reform initiatives.   
The following strategies contributed to mitigating the external negative effects, as well as ensuring that planned activities were initiated in as timely a manner as possible:  
•        An immediate and well-planned advocacy approach by the management and programme section towards decision makers for joint action and partnership on ensuring the continuation and launch of priority activities to address key issues in the education, social and child protection and health sectors.  
•        Strong partnership and support to technical teams in the relevant institutions to ensure ¿continued implementation of priority activities.  
•        Partnership with the EU Delegation, IFIs and relevant civil society organizations to ensure strong  advocacy for priority reform activities.  
The elevated Council on Child Rights has the potential to be instrumental in accelerating the most pressing child rights issues in the country in a cross-sectoral manner, but more work is needed for its full operationalization. As fundamental custodians of political commitments on child rights, parliamentarians are crucial to achieving better results for children. Therefore, Parliament and its committees served as important forums for awareness raising and monitoring of child rights policies; UNICEF further invested in its long-standing cooperation with Parliament and continued to foster joint thematic sessions around the most pressing child rights issues. Consultations with children and youth were at the core of UNICEF planning and provided valuable insights, an example of which was the implementation of the process of National Consultations for the UN Global Summit on Transforming of Education. Cross-sectoral cooperation proved to be challenging in many domains, and remains a priority to be strengthened through policy dialogue, policy briefs, platforms for multisectoral work and financing. UNICEF and other national and international partners were focused on vulnerable groups of children who experience inequality and are not counted in national averages, as well as the barriers and bottlenecks that prevent them from enjoying their rights and reaching their full potential.  UNICEF continues to leverage its neutrality to mobilize the private sector, government and wider community to develop new initiatives and build alliances for children. In all phases of business engagement, including unpacking strategic areas for engagement, developing the Business Council action plan and integrating this into CPD development, it was important to communicate how the business will benefit through shared-value partnerships.  
Regular meetings and informal check-ins with government partners, donors and CSOs proved invaluable for ensuring continued national ownership and buy-in for key programme areas, including scale-up of initiatives. Joint cross-sectoral collaboration with UN agencies undoubtedly has the potential for strengthening joint work plans, joint programmes and joint funding within the context of the UN reform. Through regular monitoring of government strategic and legislative planning, UNICEF pursued evidence-based advocacy and successfully integrated key priorities for children into relevant national strategic and planning documents including key EU documents. Important lessons were also learned during the Ukraine refugee response, about how to support partners in the future, regarding emergency preparedness and overall planning and monitoring systems.  Due to frequent institutional changes and staff turnover, the country context is rapidly changing, volatile and complex, and requires agile approaches and analysis to design and implement evidence-based programmes.  
UNICEF continued to apply innovative tools and methods to reach out to the most vulnerable children and families. In 2022 this was done through the introduction of a new multisectoral approach to treatment of children exposed to trauma and violence – advanced Neurosequential Model of Therapeutics training, an innovative approach imported by the Child Trauma Center from USA. The multisectoral approach is also nurtured through the advocacy efforts in the establishment of the Barnahus model, for child victims of the most severe cases of violence. The Bebbo mobile application for parents is a digital innovation that was launched in Montenegro and another 11 additional countries in the Europe and Central Asia region. It had a high level of reach in Montenegro, proving that digital support to parents for consistent and accurate tracking and stimulation of young children’s development from birth to the early years is feasible and in demand in Montenegro. UNICEF partnered with Duke University on an innovative initiative to apply behavioural science interventions on the design of a cash scheme. The initiative is a pilot for UNICEF in the region and globally, and the first results will outline the initiative’s potential in social policy, are expected in 2023. The first national Digital School Platform was expanded to include an additional 1,000 courses containing over 11,000 lessons, and experience and models were shared as good practice with countries in emergency situations such as Ukraine and Afghanistan.  
Overall, the CP 2017–2022 successfully contributed to an increased respect for and awareness of children’s and adolescents’ rights in Montenegro. This was reflected through national commitments through the adoption of a wide range of legislation, strategies, plans of action and investments for education, ECD, social and child protection, young people and justice. The CP has particularly responded to the needs of the most vulnerable children and adolescents including ethnic minorities and children with disabilities. UNICEF envisions four key priorities for its new country programme: (1) protecting children from poverty, adversity and violence; (2) ECD for the best start to life; (3) improved learning outcomes, skills and empowerment for all children, adolescents and young people; and (4) institutional accountability for child rights and leveraging resources for results for children.

ECAR,Romania,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons learnt
The last year of implementation for the programme of cooperation between the Government of Romania and UNICEF 2018-22 offered a number of critical lessons learned. 
Blue Dots Family Support Hubs proved to be essential child protection entry points – yet support needs go beyond. At the onset of the Ukraine refugee response in Romania focused on creating the Blue Dots at the border points – to provide refugee children and families with a safe space to get rest, receive information in the country, to decide what to do next. This proved to be an important entry point to track and trace refugees, offer direct protection – including to unaccompanied and separated children – as well as to refer those in need to other services. After an initial focus on border areas, blue dot support hubs were also established in key urban centres, such as Bucharest, Brasov, Constanta, Sibiu, to name a few. With the protraction of the crisis and the emergency of a different set of needs of refugees, including those who decided to stay in Romania, UNICEF expanded the range of services to be able to provide services related to e.g. health, including mental health and education. 
 
Subnational partnerships are essential to deliver services. 
Another lesson learned during the humanitarian refugee response is that UNICEF Romania needs to invest in expanding local and regional partnerships. This fits both the needs of UNICEF and partners since Romania is relatively decentralized and follows the expertise UNICEF has developed through a series of models – Integrated Community Centres (ICC), Child Friendly Cities (CFC), decentralized MOUs with both municipalities and counties for the response, to mention just a few. 
 
Approaches to education. 
In Romania, similar to many neighbouring countries, the school enrolment data for Ukraine children are very low. More concerted efforts are needed to opening Romanian schools to Ukrainian and other refugee children to ensure inclusiveness and integration and to ensure their right to education. 
 
Innovations 
Partnership with the private sector for children can change the game
UNICEF fostered two new partnerships with the private sector, namely Rethink Romania, an initiative of Romanian major entrepreneurs in support of the quality of education and the National Coalition for Women Entrepreneurship, an initiative in support of reducing school dropout and teenage pregnancies.  These partnerships are the first that UNICEF Romania established with large business coalitions to advocate together and mobilize resources for structural reforms in education and access to services. The entrepreneurs coming together under these initiatives proved to be able to act both as key advocates for child rights and long-term initiatives, but also as changemakers as they support different initiatives in education as well as for promoting gender equality.  
 
Integrated Community Centres remain at the core of ensuring children’s access to integrated services 
In 2022, UNICEF’s continued investments in modelling pathways to offer integrated services for children provided further key evidence around the local systems’ capacity and effectiveness to proactively address and respond to children’s needs.  This included insights around the “how” models of effective and sustainable integrated community centres (ICCs) responding to multiple and various contexts (urban/rural; small/large communities) can be devised.  Tools and working methodologies developed were shared nationwide in close collaboration with the local Bacau Public Health Department.  
While significant new funding opportunities emerged in 2022 that promise to provide sustainable funding for ICCS (e.g. National Resilience and Recovery Programme), UNICEF’s operational expertise on ICCs was recognized by the Ministry of Health, as per national regulations issued in November 2022. The guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health via new regulations providing pathways for communities interested in developing integrated community centres to access funding. UNICEF has been requested to continue to act as a key partner for supporting the creation of new ICCs given its technical know-how and experience. 
Another lesson learned was offered by the fact that, beyond the five ICCs supported by UNICEF providing access to more than 4,000 children and their parents, the centers were also able to open their doors to refugee children and their families. This work is ongoing and will offer further lessons learned and will be used to address bottlenecks and structural barriers related to access to integrated services by vulnerable children. 
"
ECAR,Serbia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"FOSTERING INNOVATION AND USE OF TECHNOLOGIES
 
In 2022, UNICEF Serbia and Deloitte conducted an in-depth evaluation of its work on innovations, which found that UNICEF plays a key role in promoting digital innovations, leveraging partnerships, and using the UNICEF brand power to secure commitment and financial resources for innovation. UNICEF’s role in future innovation work will focus on three pillars: 1) act as an advisor on child rights in technological innovations; 2) convenor for the Serbian innovation ecosystem to facilitate partnerships and legitimize innovations through UNICEF brand power; and 3) act as a knowledge hub among innovators for the benefit of the most marginalized children.
 
The development of innovative solutions continued in 2022, and with trusted business partner VegaIt Solutions a mobile application to help deaf and hearing-impaired children to learn sign language was developed and will be launched in 2023, showcasing the strong commitment of businesses to promote inclusive and social causes and through sharing of knowledge and core assets. The Bebbo parenting app achieved excellent results and was downloaded by more than 44,000 persons across Serbia, contributing to better support and reliable information around their child’s health being available to parents and caregivers across Serbia.
 
The topic of online violence and exploitation is becoming more relevant as children spend increasing time online. UNICEF acted as a broker in prevention of digital bullying and unethical advertising by bringing together all mobile operators, celebrities and regulators to influence existing policies and practices. Jointly with the most influential media publishing house in Serbia, UNICEF reached 6 million views during a 40-day campaign at the beginning of the new school year, raising awareness among parents and teachers on digital violence prevention. UNICEF also participated at the 2022 Games.con festival, including in the panel ‘Gaming and children: challenges and opportunities’, to highlight some of the potential risks like sexual exploitation and abuse of children online.
 
The mental health and well-being of young people, particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic but also more broadly due to issues such as anxiety around the future, climate change and lack of opportunities, gained wide public and political attention. As part of the innovations currently being introduced in providing minimum standards of care for young people, UNICEF and the Institute of Mental Health are testing tele-mental health services aiming to improve access to services where needed through promoting use of new technologies to serve children and adolescents, especially the most disadvantaged, suffering from poor mental health.
 
LESSONS LEARNED
 
A constant re-prioritization and reassessment of risks, opportunities and mitigation measures to ensure achievement of results for children in an unpredictable political environment continued to be challenging, requiring frequent adjustments and delays. Parliamentary, presidential and local elections in April 2022 and an extended technical government caused significant delays in the adoption of critical legislations and measures, including the Family Law, Social Welfare Law, the Law on Internships, the Action Plan to the De-institutionalization strategy, development of a new Social Welfare strategy, and more.
 
Sustainable and lasting change takes time, and this is important to factor into the planning of specific reform processes. In this regard, while the establishment of resource centres was an important milestone, immediate results towards the transformation of attitudes and practices in the education system will take time. Similarly, mainstreaming of innovative maternal, child health and ECD solutions requires clear prioritization of maternal, newborn and child health within the context of primary health care reforms in order to improve outcomes for children and caregivers through system-level changes. Scaling up these innovations in service delivery, such as in youth mental health or ECD/ECI services, requires financing models to be developed for evidence-based policy-making and sustainable resourcing as well as broader coalitions of partners supportive of the cause.
 
On a more societal and values level, recent heated debates around violence in schools illustrates the need to further strengthen the work around social and behaviour change to address social norms that are harmful to all, but particularly to boys and girls in developing stages of their lives – including behaviours and practices driven by deeply rooted social norms, patriarchal attitudes and gender stereotypes, so as to create a more tolerant, inclusive and caring society.
 
At the community level, working on horizontal learning and coaching mechanisms, both between professionals and children and young people, proved an effective approach to enhance the quality and ownership of new ways of collaborating. Learning clubs in school, horizontal exchange between school staff, peer support among youth in mental health programmes as well as on climate and environmental issues proved to be highly effective and should be incorporated in all future capacity-building approaches to strengthen ownership and sustainability.
 
In order to empower young people to become active agents of change and make their voices heard at the community level, they also require adequate knowledge about specific topics. This is evident when it comes to emerging issues such as climate and environment, inclusion, as well as mental health literacy. Young people want to make a difference, but they require the knowledge and the tools to do so effectively.

The work with the regulatory bodies and the business community to strengthen ethical marketing principles for children with particular focus on gender norms was an important milestone this year and will be continued in 2023 to secure sustainable changes. 
"
ECAR,Tajikistan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Innovative policy-based tracking system for SDG financing for children
Public finance for children continued to be a priority area in 2022. UNICEF with other UN agencies led the SDG Financing agenda through advocacy, coordination, and capacity building. These efforts have contributed to strengthening the national financial architecture, broader policy engagement and partnership to promote financing for development in Tajikistan. A roadmap for Financing SDGs is under consideration by the Government followed by the inter-agency review and feedback process.

Partnership with the Ministry of Finance was further strengthened under the tracking tool initiative that aimed at creating an integrated SDG financing tracking mechanism and digitalising reporting process of child related indicators of the budget. This innovative policy-based tracking system identify, tag, and monitor SDG initiatives disaggregated by gender and age across government agencies through the national budget, thereby strengthening SDG planning, implementation and financing.

At the local level, UNICEF provided technical assistance with development of socio-economic indicators for 2023 and projections for 2024-2026 to regional and district economic development departments to ensure the local priorities, including child related indicators are integrated within national priorities.

To raise awareness on the selected areas of public finance management, several learning sessions were offered to the UNICEF staff with participation of local expert, followed by the discussions on linkages of sectoral public finance initiatives with the new 2023-2026 UNICEF Tajikistan country programme scope.
 
Moving forward on a more unified and strategic child rights monitoring agenda
Based on previous lessons learned, UNICEF moved towards a more unified and strategic child rights monitoring agenda. UNICEF strived to link the data supply and SDG monitoring elements with the work on strengthening the child rights institutions. For example, the results of the situation analysis in Roghun and Nurobod conducted by the MEDT within the SDG localization agenda were presented at the high-level event organized by the office of the Commissioner on Human (and Child) Rights. This allowed wider dissemination of the situation analysis results and innovative collaboration with the MEDT on child-focused SDG monitoring agenda.

Furthermore, attendance of the representative from the secretariat of the National Commission on Child Rights (NCCR) together with the Tajstat representative at the regional Transmonee meeting and the country’s presentation of achievements and challenges on data for children with a focus on vulnerable children drew more attention to the importance of data systems on vulnerable children. Familiarization of the NCCR representative with the draft regional child rights monitoring framework opened new entry points to making the work of the NCCR more result-oriented (focusing on the situation of children). These efforts gave impetus to making the child rights monitoring more explicit and visible on the national agenda.
 
Lesson Learned: Legal access to a sufficient supply of KIO3 is needed for the successful implementation of salt iodization nationally
In 2022, UNICEF supported strong steps for universal salt iodization with about 89 per cent of household salt reported to be adequately iodized. However, a bottleneck analysis revealed levels of iodization varied between small, medium and large-scale producers, with the supply of KIO3 being the biggest challenge. To resolve this, UNICEF convened regional roundtable discussions with salt producers, key government ministries and other relevant stakeholders explored options to access legal, quality assured KIO3. As a result, a revolving fund for KIO3, to be managed by the government, will be established in 2023 by leveraging resources from other development partners. UNICEF also supported the development of the standard of salt iodization to eliminate ambiguity.

Lesson Learned: Digital learning
Development of digital ecosystem in education requires a full-fledged approach to address ICT and non-ICT related gaps, which should be informed and guided by the national strategic documents on digital education transformation under the leadership of National ICT Council and it is critical to build solid partnership and coordination around the digital agenda between government, development partners and private sector.

Government buy-in and institutional reform are key to effective digital learning strategies. Without systems-level reform and resources, the development of digital competencies and use of digital technologies in teaching and learning processes remain untenable and unscalable.

Teachers and parents can underestimate the impact of technology on student learning. Parents’ lack of digital skills must be prioritized through community engagement interventions. Awareness raising and provision of information and education are essential steps. Well-designed digital solutions can supplement best practices for teaching.

Digital solutions should expand and enhance teaching practices, blending online learning and face-to-face teaching, for the best learning outcomes.
 
Lesson Learned: Competency-based learning
Teachers’ engagement has shown that quality interventions focusing on teachers’ professional development increase educational quality and learning outcomes. However, ensuring competency-based education reform in Tajikistan requires greater ownership and support from government educational institutions, donors and partners especially for the most marginalized children and children with special needs. In order to ensure replication and expansion of the competency model, additional learning pathways have been identified in close collaboration with MoES. 

On the other hand, the turnover of teachers and changing of national priorities are key challenges. To improve further quality for competency-based education and pre-service teacher trainings other alternative platforms such as technology for teaching and learning should be harnessed. Computer-mediated instruction provides the ability to individualize learning for each teacher and student.  

Additionally, a change in teachers’ role is required. Competency-based learning shifts the role of the teacher from the centre to school-based support, whereby teachers are continuously supported in their work with students, guiding learning, answering questions, leading discussions, and helping students synthesize and apply knowledge.

ECAR,Türkiye,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Significant progress in innovation has been through partnerships with the private sector and municipalities to deliver results for children. 
Engagement with the private sector to support programmatic priorities has great potential and should be expanded further. The skills pledge with the BAB, which will provide “learning to earning” opportunities for thousands of young people, the partnership with LEGO on preschool, with SAP and DELL on skills, with Dogan on gender, are some of the examples were scale and/or acceleration of results have been possible thanks to a joint public-private engagement and a strong convening role of UNICEF. 
Through its Field Office in the Southeast, UNICEF has developed an innovative programme by establishing Youth Centers in Kilis City . In the centers, young people learn digital and soft skills and strengthen their employability, including through specific skills courses linked to the relevant industries in the province. UNICEF secured support from the private sector for the digital skills courses as well as “Mobile Maker Bus” equipped with computers and educational resources to expand the ‘Makers’ programme to youths living in rural areas.  Working in partnership with municipalities and the private sector to ensure acceleration of results for children from vulnerable communities is proving a good practice that UNICEF will extend to other municipalities in the coming years.  
UNICEF signed its first rolling workplan with Ankara Metropolitan Municipality. Expanding the work at the level of metropolitan municipalities is also needed to ensure services to some of the most vulnerable children, including refugees (mainly Syrians and Afghani). 
The ongoing partnership with LEGO provided an additional 1,255 Duplo Boxes and 915 Six Bricks, reaching 40,610 children. UNICEF supported cascade training for 885 MoNE preschool teachers on LEGO-guided learning materials through play in 18 provinces. The innovative pedagogy has been appreciated by partners and discussions are underway with LEGO Foundation to continue a second phase.
UNICEF has begun crucial studies to generate evidence to design more innovative ECE programming. A new SBC Programme agreement was established between UNICEF and TRC to build on the recent KAP Study findings.To inform the equitable expansion of ECE services, UNICEF is undertaking an ECE investment Case Study, to help identify capacity gaps in planning, budgeting, and expenditures. More investment studies are needed to inform advocacy efforts, influence financing decisions and explore blended financing opportunities with IFIs for the social sector.
SBC programmes were also scaled up significantly in 2022, standing as a  cross-sectoral innovation across the programme. Integration with key government stakeholders and CSOss resulted in engagement with 12,811 community members and service providers, including 12,000 women and girls, to facilitate community dialogue on gender stereotypes, adolescent rights, gender-based violence and prevention of child marriage. The development of the first work plan with the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change resulted in the training of 209 Youth Climate Envoys, who are now participating in national and global climate related policy level discussions (four youth climate envoys joined the Government delegationat COP27). This contributed to positioning UNICEF as partner of choice when it comes to ensuring youth participationtowards development of national climate change prevention and/or adaptation policies and programmes. 
Ongoing work around market shaping for educational products in Türkiye has been a significant innovative approach. UNICEF has developed two educational products for the Türkiye context – My Playbox and Early Childhood Education Study books – and have both been exported to UNICEF programmes in Ukraine and the surrounding regional response countries. Adapting these products to other geographies has allowed TCO to reach an economy of scale, while also conducting market shaping for educational suppliers in Türkiye, resulting in an overall supply procurement value USD 49 million. This is a quadrupling of value in comparison to the usual UNICEF contribution of USD 10 million on average annually. The agile distribution abroad was supported by UNICEF Supply Division.
During the first Genc-UPSHIFT cycle launch, 10,160 young innovators registered to be supported by 546 trainers.  Youth skilling linked to social entrepreneurship remains a vibrant space in Türkiye to be actively explored. UNICEF supported MoYS to strengthen further and expand the Mahalle (Neighbourhood) Support Mechanism, where 500 youth volunteers reviewed and re-designed the modality for national scale up. The Mahalle model was also presented to other COs in the region.
 UNICEF together with Koç University (KU), has developed an evaluation learning module that will be used to develop and enhance the evaluation capacity of implementing partners including the government, NGOs, and academia. UNICEF also established that a common evaluation agenda with the Independent Evaluation Laboratory (IEL) at Koc University and expanding collaborations with other universities is possible which will help enhance national capacities for research and evaluation and provide a platform for dissemination of best practices on evaluation.
Finally, the Office embarked on a Programmatic Review.  The intent was to assess the validity of key strategies deployed in attaining results for children in light of the socio-political and economic fast evolving context. The Office is one of the few globally to have undertaken this exercise, to innovatively evaluate the effectiveness of the strategies used to address key bottlenecks which hamper child well-being agenda in Türkiye. It recommended key strategic programmatic shifts to be implemented in 2023 onwards to accelerate results for children.

ECAR,Turkmenistan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Multi-dimensional approach to Climate Change Education
Turkmenistan ranks 1st among 172 countries in the global ranking of energy intensity, with significant potential for energy savings from implementation of energy efficiency measures in consumption, including in the residential and services sectors, which account around 42% of the total energy use in Turkmenistan. Education and awareness raising is therefore key for achieving efficient energy use and living in harmony with the environment. 
 
Given its mandate and strong partnership with Ministry of Education and other partners, UNICEF adopted a comprehensive multi-dimensional approach to integration of climate change and environmental education in the national education system combining interventions at multiple levels (policies, institutions, communities, individuals) of socio-ecological model of climate change adaptation convening stakeholders from multiple sectors.
 
At the policy level, using the system strengthening approach, the National Child-centered Disaster Risk Reduction Strategy was finalized in 2022 with support of the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Population, Ministry of Justice, Mejlis (National Parliament), National Red Crescent Society of Turkmenistan and other key national partners and was submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers for endorsement. The Strategy enhances the national policy framework of Turkmenistan aiming at reducing vulnerability and strengthening resilience of children and adolescents to climate change impacts and natural hazards.
 
At the institutional level, UNICEF supported capacity-building of the Ministry of Education and the National Institute of Education to integrate CCA/DRR topics in the curricula and deliver learning through interactive child-centered pedagogies. 5 Methodological Manuals for teachers in Turkmen and Russian languages supporting the teachers in application of the interactive teaching and learning methodology and covering 5 environment-related subjects were developed and officially endorsed as a result of a series of consultations with the national partners, in particular Ministry of Education and the National Institute of Education of Turkmenistan, ensuring their ownership and full engagement “Green School” programme was developed in 2022 for introduction in 2023 as a framework of criteria and guidance for schools to mainstream CCA topics in practice by developing ‘greening plans’ and implementing relevant activities to achieve green status at school level.
 
In addition to integration of topics in the school curriculum, UNICEF worked on integrating CCA topics in pre-schools, focusing on the climate-change-aware socialization of children from an early age and using interactive play-based teaching methods. While work continues to finalize the in-service climate change training course for schoolteachers and pre-service training course for higher education institutions (preparing future teachers), UNICEF and the Ministry of Education also developed a short training course on CCA/DRR for the Summer Recreation Centers for children. The course was developed as a digital product and shared with all recreation centers across the country. The training package includes didactical electronic games, quizzes and interactive contests using the best practices of teaching and learning.
 
At the community level, the capacities of children, teachers, women and local administrations in the selected regions were enhanced on CCA/DRR topics which strengthened their resilience and ensured community engagement for the management of risks and promotion of sustainable development. Partnership with the NRCST allowed evidence generation on school resilience in regions which are vulnerable to hazards of the Aral Sea problem.
 
Using a comprehensive and multi-dimensional approach to Climate Change education, ensures the sustainability of Climate Change teaching-learning process in Turkmenistan through the education system, which prepares a knowledgeable and skilled generation of children and young people, with energy- and environment-responsible behaviours. Going forward, UNICEF is exploring partnerships for integration of renewable energy sources in the school facilities, learning from Health Facility Solar Electrification (HFSE) initiative which Turkmenistan will implement in 2023 with UNICEF support.
 
Development of a cross-sectoral approach to ECD in Turkmenistan
Cross-sectoral integration of early childhood development (ECD) services with focus on the most vulnerable young children and their families is the major priority under the national ECD Strategy for 2020-2025 with inter-ministerial Working Group leading the process. 
 
Ensuring trans- and multi-disciplinary modality for early intervention provision requires competencies of pediatrician, psychologist, speech therapist, pedagogue, social worker, provided by health, education, and social protection sectors. UNICEF and inter-Ministerial Working Group on ECD promoted a cross-sectoral approach to capacity development for provision of early intervention services for young children with disabilities and their families, by designing a 6-module training for trans-disciplinary specialists provided to childcare professionals from health, pre-school education and social protection sectors.
 
As a result, selected sectoral professionals at the local levels initiated a team approach in delivering early intervention programmes for young children with disabilities and their families, with more comprehensive and individualized support to these families. This approach informed and facilitated cross-sectoral cooperation for continuity and enhanced quality of service provision across the sectors and child’s life cycle.
 
A valuable lesson learned in 2022 is that having a functional inter-ministerial Working Group on ECD in Turkmenistan facilitated the design of a cross-sectoral capacity development programme, in line with the needs and recommended best practice on ECD, while the training programme reinforced the provisions of cross-sectoral ECD services in practice. This regular multi-stakeholder collaboration process on ECD, coordinated by the lead sectoral Ministries (MoHMI, MoE, MoLSP), facilitated a shared vision and commitment to develop a normative framework which resulted in drafting a joint inter-ministerial provision on early intervention services.

ECAR,Ukraine,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Child-Friendly Spaces and Digital Services for Children
UNICEF established over 300 temporary and permanent ‘Spilno’ child-friendly spaces as an innovative flagship intervention. These spaces were opened in collaboration with the government, local authorities, civil society and business partners to provide a sense of normalcy for families with children affected by war. The ‘Spilno’ spaces were placed as stand-alone inclusive spots both outside communities and inside public places across Ukraine, such as IDP centers, churches and railway stations, while educational, social, health and out-of-school facilities were closed or unavailable for children and caregivers. Parents and children were able to play, interact and receive cross-sectoral services, including consultations on health, MHPSS and social services.
Due to the massive closure of kindergartens, UNICEF developed the first-ever online kindergarten (NUMO), accessible to the displaced, caregivers in occupied territories, refugees in hosting countries and all parents in Ukraine. The NUMO online kindergarten consists of 121 episodes of interactive preschool lessons, covering all of the key competencies of child development for over 4,600,000 unique beneficiaries.
In addition, using the experience of the COVID-19 response, multiple digital platforms and solutions were implemented to provide services for children and parents, as well as collect data, while physical access for beneficiaries was absent or limited.
- The Social and Behavior Change section tailored its social listening and social data collection instruments for the humanitarian response. The team collected and analyzed real-time data on the needs and behaviours of people on the move, internally displaced people, host communities and communities on the frontline. Reports helped to tailor the programme response (e.g., Back to Learning initiative, winter clothing), and provide additional information and services to children and caregivers on topics such as ECE/ECD, MHPSS, breastfeeding and safety.

- Other innovative developments in education included equipping teachers with knowledge and skills on MHPSS and self-care for their students, as well as launching a chatbot on Telegram and Viber to track the well-being of the students and help teachers to identify early signs of distress and anxiety among students and inform them about referral mechanisms. A lesson learned on the web accessibility of the All-Ukrainian School Online platform was that it needed improvements to meet the needs of users with disabilities, including hearing and visual impairments.

- The introduction of assistive technologies, in particular eye-tracker and boardmakers technologies, in education settings was another innovation. This required continuous training and engagement of specialists, teachers and parents to help children in using the devices for communication, learning and self-development.
Third-Party Monitoring
The rapid scale of the UNICEF response, amid limited human resources and access, required innovative solutions for the monitoring of UNICEF supplies and services delivered across the country. UNICEF established a unique third-party monitoring scheme through partnership with academic sociological institutions, which had a network of over 300 data collection professionals spread across the country. As a result, in 2022, over 3,000 face-to-face digital monitoring visits were conducted at distribution sites all over Ukraine. UNICEF also introduced a comprehensive internal reporting and data management system that informed the country office’s decision making, donor reporting, visualization of the scope of interventions with deep dives into disaggregated data on beneficiaries, implementing partners, geographical coverage, and so on. In addition, live monitoring tools are being developed and improved, including the tools for daily monitoring of Spilno Child Spots, mobile teams and staff field visits, providing knowledge of the situation on the ground, needs, successes and identifying areas for improvement."
ESAR,Angola,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"When the impact study of Valor Criança was planned, it proved crucial to have involved INE from the beginning during the baseline phase in 2019. Meetings with the highest level of INE, where the lead researcher from UNICEF’s Office of Research, Innocenti explained the methodology, were key to gain the full support of INE. This was important for ownership and credibility. Given the longitudinal nature of the study, where enumerators went back to thousands of households that they interviewed three years ago, INE faced several challenges during data collection. Thanks to the previous collaboration with the local social action teams and strong coordination with municipalities and provincial governments where data was being collected, INE was able to reach the required number of households within the scheduled timeline. A key driver of success were the weekly meetings with representatives of the key stakeholders involved (MASFAMU, INE, UNICEF), which allowed the teams to find solutions and discuss the challenges and progress achieved.
The preliminary results of the Valor Criança Impact Study were shared by Innocenti in December 2022 and is an important platform for evidence-based advocacy and strategic discussions with the Angolan government on the importance of continuing to invest in cash transfers for children due to the positive impacts on the well-being of children and families. The preliminary results have shown consistent improvements in the material wellbeing of the children (shoes, clothing and bedding) as well as improvements in quality of the nutritional options for children. The children who received cash transfers also showed improvements in health practices such as vaccines and vitamins and having health cards; while the qualitative component of the study confirmed that families more readily accessed health services as they were able to pay for medicines and treatments. Importantly, family dynamics were also improved as the quantitative and qualitative data confirmed that families made joint decisions on how to spend funds and support the needs of the children and the family. 
The preliminary results also highlighted challenges faced by the project with cash payment points defined by the banks and the long distances faced by some beneficiaries. This was exacerbated by the low coverage of banking services, which continued to show limited capacity for financial transactions and benefits in terms of financial inclusion as the structural problems remained. The lessons learned by the Valor Criança project in operationalizing services for social protection through local authorities has been instrumental in shaping the Government´s scale-up of the project in 18 provinces; the impact study will further provide key recommendations for sustainability and improve the impact on the ground.
Finally, the process of doing the Valor Criança impact study provided valuable lessons that will influence our work with INE in 2023. There were some significant operational and ethical challenges that arose during the process. UNICEF had the opportunity to present and discuss these challenges with INE and agreed on some capacity building initiatives that will be useful and relevant for future surveys undertaken by INE in the future.
Drawing on guidance from the global UNICEF, UNESCO and World Bank Mission Recovery Education initiative, the UNICEF emergency response in Angola addressed the challenges of learning loss, exacerbated by the pandemic due to school closures and limited access to distance learning modalities. Implemented in close collaboration with MoE and the Huila Provincial Government, the Mission Recovery project in Huila focused on foundational learning in literacy and numeracy to address this learning loss. The pilot project in Huila provided evidence of the critical need to prioritise learning in these subjects, and the rationale to scale up nationwide the three priority aims established in the Mission Recovery strategy that emphasise the holistic needs of children’s health and psychosocial wellbeing and guided by teachers that have been adequately trained to address the learning loss.
To strengthen the immunization programme, UNICEF Angola procured and installed remote temperature monitoring equipment to be used in vaccine transport and storage, providing an accurate and continuous record of temperatures being maintained throughout the entire supply chain process. Besides this procurement, UNICEF Angola also trained the cold chain managers and vaccination staff on how to read the temperature monitoring reports and take informed decisions. Continuing to strengthen the immunization programme, UNICEF Angola trained technicians on how to use Logistimo software, which empowers the officials by providing an overview of vaccine management in the country.
"
ESAR,Botswana,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Despite the economic recovery in 2022, it is clear that the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated inequities in Botswana and inflation is hitting households, especially in rural areas hard. Social protection systems are as important as ever, yet challenges persist with limited political commitment towards the transformation of the existing weak and inefficient systems towards the adoption of the National Social Protection Framework which is based on the life cycle approach. UNICEF will need to work closely with UNDP, ILO and the World Bank, aligning messaging and support, in order to ensure that the transition to the framework is accelerated and development partners’ support maximized. 
  
Following the comparatively successful COVID-19 vaccination roll-out, the campaign is now faced with diminishing returns and uptake of the vaccine has stagnated. As it is becoming apparent that COVID-19 is not yet history, innovative strategies will be required to continue the vaccination drive for vaccine-hesitant and hard to reach populations, focusing on the use of insights from social listening and previous community engagement work. Furthermore, as the pandemic exposed weaknesses and gaps in the national health system, it will be critical for UNICEF to support integration of lessons learnt from the COVID-19 experience into the national health system in order to address challenges around data systems, accountability systems and systematic supportive supervision.  
  
The lack of recent data through nationally representative household surveys that includes indicators of child wellbeing and the time lags for processing, analysis and publication of data emerging from administrative data systems continue to pose challenges in monitoring progress towards national plans and the SDGs as they relate to children. UNICEF, together with other development partners will advocate with the newly established National Planning Commission and other relevant stakeholders for the inclusion of a Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) or Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in data generation plans. Additionally, UNICEF will seek to identify opportunities for and where possible directly support granular analysis of existing data from the recently completed census and Botswana AIDS Impact Survey to generate updates on child-related indicators.  
  
In 2022, the country office transitioned to a new CPD and a life cycle-based approach to programming. The small staff complement means that all members of the programme team are expected to work across both stages of the child’s life cycle and only the second decade is clearly reflected in the staffing structure. With the recruitment of critical positions in late 2022, a key priority at the beginning of 2023 will be to clearly determine individual and collective accountabilities around the life cycle. Furthermore, entry points will need to be identified for more integrated programming for the first decade and ensure that they are feasible given current capacities.
In terms of adolescent and youth participation, current structures in Botswana are weak and rarely involve young people as leaders. Building on the appointment of a youth advocate in late 2022 and the drafting of the first rolling work plan with the Ministry for Youth, Ministry of Youth, Gender, Sport and Culture, a key focus in 2023 will be to continue the reflection on UNICEF’s role, capacity and strategic positioning in strengthening such structures. The country office also has plans to establish a Children and Youth Advisory Panel to UNICEF to better structure the country office’s own engagement with youth as beneficiaries, partners, and leaders, through the creation of a Children and Youth Advisory Panel to UNICEF. Furthermore, Botswana does not have a network of young people living with HIV, which is a lost opportunity given the challenges related to HIV treatment adherence among adolescents, and the role that a youth-led network could play in providing peer-support services. UNICEF is undergoing discussions with youth advocates living with HIV, and from communities most affected by HIV, to explore the feasibility of establishing a national network.
  
Ending violence against children will remain a key priority in 2023, given the high rates of violence especially sexual violence among young girls and physical violence on boys. While progress was made in 2022 in activating the Eseng mo ngwaneng campaign to end violence against children in selected districts, strengthening government ownership of and commitment to the campaign as well as shifting to a multisectoral approach involving the education and health sectors as service delivery systems and critical stakeholders will be essential in order to achieve the goal of elevating the campaign to a national movement which is actively borne by a broad coalition of stakeholders. Furthermore, building on the President’s mention of the campaign in his November State of the Nation address for the opening of Parliament, advocacy for stronger involvement of the Executive in actually planning and implementing interventions to end violence must be prioritized.  
  
As two longstanding UNICEF-supported interventions supporting adolescents and HIV undergo evaluations in 2023, it will be important for the country office to reflect on the sustainability of such support. The office will need to be deliberate about engaging with government and donors to ensure that interventions delivered by NGOs are linked to and embedded within government service delivery systems to ensure sustainability and scalability."
ESAR,Burundi,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons learned
In a context like Burundi where the needs of children are present in all the sectors, there is a need for more programmatic and geographic convergence to ensure a better impact for each child. UNICEF is therefore refocusing its interventions around multi-sectoral intervention packages especially around early childhood development. With the objective to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of UNICEF support at community level as well as reinforce internal synergies, UNICEF will start prioritizing the implementation of community activities in a selection of provinces with the highest percentages of vulnerable children.
In 2022, UNICEF worked on building the resilience of systems as well as community to contribute to long-lasting and sustainable changes. UNICEF conducted significant work this year to harmonize approaches used by the office as well as to bring partners in this discussion. An approach that has proven particularly effective is the support provided to community-based social protection initiatives such as the Solidarity Groups. UNICEF will continue its work with community platforms and approaches as well as work to establish the functional linkages between community systems and public social services. It will be more engaged at the commune level to see how to plan, monitor and coordinate activities with the community, which will help UNICEF to design a community approach linked to decentralized services in the coming years.
The high prevalence of stunting, but also the exposure to stress (9 out of 10 children are exposed to violent disciplining practices), a lack of early stimulation and limited opportunities for early learning (only one out of ten young children are enrolled in preschool education) lead to far too few children thriving. Short-term consequences include increased morbidity and mortality, decreased cognitive, motor, language, and socio-emotional development, increased healthcare expenditures and opportunity costs related to the care of sick children. Long-term consequences include an increase in non-communicable diseases, low school performance, and decreased work capacity. Ultimately, this implies a high opportunity cost in terms of adult productivity and limits the ability of younger generations to grow out of poverty and contribute effectively to Burundi’s development. UNICEF has therefore put increased emphasis on ECD interventions, because of the high return on investment for interventions targeting the youngest children. An integrated package of health, nutrition, protection, and WASH interventions at scale has been developed to increase the proportion of children reaching their full developmental potential and strengthen human capital development in Burundi – the package will be piloted and rolled out in selected provinces in 2023.
Other areas of concern remain chronic malnutrition and neonatal mortality. Burundi has some of the highest levels of under-five chronic malnutrition in the world, with rates that have plateaued at around 55% for over a decade. Current efforts around food systems by various stakeholders have not sufficiently prioritized children’s food needs. There is a need to focus on nutrient-dense crops and animal husbandry. Moreover, existing nutrition interventions through health systems and community-based promotion of nutrition practices proved that they were not sufficient on their own, as nutritious food is not available or affordable for most households. Programmes need to be multifaceted and encompass nutrition counselling, cash and nutritious food to be able to make a difference for malnourished children.
Innovation 
Innovation continued to be a key enabler for UNICEF’s work in Burundi and UNICEF has the potential to be a future leader in driving innovation in Burundi. A series of capacity-building initiatives have been organized to enhance understanding on UNICEF’s INVENT innovation platform, human-centred design, the global landscape of UNICEF’s innovation portfolio. 
 
An innovation challenge was launched in May 2022 with a focus on finding innovative solutions for cross-sectoral priorities: ECD, adolescents and climate change. Six projects were selected and received $50,000 each as seed funding. One of the projects involved the production of toys adapted to local context using empty cartons of ready-to-use therapeutic food to improve stimulation for SAM children and therefore improve their recovery. A total of 100 children (including internally displaced children and children in street situation) participated in a toy designing contest, which showed a lot of innovative ideas from the children themselves. Selected models of toys will be designed, multiplied, and piloted from early 2023 in three health facilities that offer care and treatment for children affected by SAM in outpatient centres. Another innovative project aims to prevent and expose abuse, violence and exploitation, including sexual abuse. Vulnerable girls and those affected by climate change, living in IDP sites and host communities, benefited from empowerment activities through the production of ecological coals. This project provides 100 girls, called “Green Girls”, with a protective environment and access to economic opportunities that allow them to meet their basic social needs as well as the children under their care. Participants are equipped with knowledge on the collection and management of household waste, the manufacture of ecological coals and improved stoves, entrepreneurial and business skills, and the mitigation of climate change risks within their community.
 
Human-centred innovation methodologies were piloted in the planning process of the next country programme. Incorporation of an Empathy Map[1] and insights from the consultations with children and youth supported the integration of a child-centred approach in the process.  UNICEF strengthened its Accountability to Affected Population (AAP) mechanisms and organized country-wide consultations with the most marginalized groups of children to understand their priorities to be considered in the new country programme. A workshop with civil society partners was organized to gain a better understanding of the current approaches related to AAP and strengthen standards.
 
Despite the latest progress on innovation, challenge remains in mainstreaming innovation in a sustainable way. While several capacity-building initiatives were implemented, innovation is not yet perceived as the “everyone’s business”. After the completion of innovation challenge, capacity gaps remain in the coordination of project implementation, monitoring and documentation of lessons learned. More focus will be put going forward on evaluating the innovative projects towards a potential scale-up if proven that they are successful.

ESAR,Comoros,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Multisectoral collaboration – specifically the involvement of education actors to support youth vaccination – is recognized as an important success factor in the context of vaccination campaigns against COVID-19. The routinization of the COVID-19 vaccination has enabled the pooling of resources dedicated to COVID-19 in support of other routine activities. It will therefore be essential to continue promoting multisectoral and integrated approaches to WASH, protection, nutrition, and birth registration.
 
The peer outreach approach, which harnessed the peer power of young reporters and members of teen clubs, yielded excellent results in 2022. In 2023, greater engagement will take place to empower young people to be champions for the environment.
 
Learning losses caused by school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic led the Ministry of Education and UNICEF to revise the in-service teacher training strategy. 
 
UNICEF support for the participation of Comoros in the regional workshop on Integrated National Financing Frameworks & Open Budgets has opened stronger collaboration with the Assembly of the Union of the Comoros. This collaboration can further strengthen advocacy for greater mobilization of domestic and more sustainable resources.
 
The creation and strengthening of existing community and digital platforms, such as village health committees, young reporters, or networks of mother leaders, made it possible to strengthen community engagement for children's rights.

ESAR,Eritrea,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Following the visit by GPE headquarters representatives, monthly tripartite meetings with relevant ministries, including the MoFND, were initiated to stress the need for funds utilization and resolve outstanding DCT issues. This led to facilitating a joint UNICEF/MoE field mission to assess progress towards completion of the Kekerbet boarding school located in Gash Barka.

During the year, UNICEF efforts to mobilize development resources for Eritrea through development partners (British and Irish aid agencies, governments of Italy and Japan) met growing challenges, as they preferred to fund UNICEF through the humanitarian window to promote climate resilience. This highlighted the need for periodic brief updates—over and above scheduled donor reports—on progress and challenges in programme implementation. The two country visits facilitated by UNICEF successfully led to greater clarity and appreciation of the programming context. As next steps, development of the GPE ‘compact’ and an enabling environment analysis will be crucial to shaping concerted efforts to drive transformation in the education sector.

Through UNICEF Australia, the office was able to demonstrate the strong links between climate-resilient water supply and the elimination of trachoma, which enabled extension of the funding agreement with the Fred Hollows Foundation for another three years.

The Water Resource Department of the MoLWE provided firm leadership in expediting the humanitarian response for affected communities and delivered timely results. The partnership between UNICEF and Eritrea’s national procurement entity (Red Sea Corporation) facilitated both in-country and offshore procurement of water supply and solar equipment that were made available within four months.

The GoSE-led VNR process exposed the challenge of data unavailability for tracking children’s progress in various core development areas. The VNR report acknowledged the urgency of strengthening the national statistical system and building capacity for domestic data generation, processing, analysis and dissemination by enhancing collaboration and coordination among data producers in the country. The VNR recommended the establishment of a strong and efficient national statistical system and reliable, high-quality data as critical elements to guide and support evidence-based planning and advance the 2030 Agenda. UNICEF, UNFPA and UNDP plan to take advantage of this opportunity, prioritizing in the joint workplan with the MoFND the examination of joint programming to support government attempts to fill the gaps in data for 23 of 44 child-related SDG indicators.

ESAR,"ESARO, Kenya",Lessons Learned and Innovations,"With global and regional urgency and priority mounting on climate resilience, renewable energy and environmental and social safeguards, ESARO was among the forerunners in articulating UNICEF’s niche and strategies for addressing the climate crisis. Yet, uptake and initiatives at the country level have varied as COs seek conducive entry points. The global discourse on climate change is shifting from mitigation towards adaptation and resilience, especially among the most vulnerable communities. This finds UNICEF with a strong comparative advantage. Whether through generating data/evidence on climate impacts on vulnerable children, or through supporting climate-resilient WASH services in communities, schools and health care facilities, or climate-oriented education, ESARO is well positioned to build on the region’s strong foundational work for children to sharpen and expand UNICEF’s contribution to the climate agenda.
 
Against the newly launched UNICEF Disability Inclusion Policy and Strategy 2023–2030 and Strategic Plan, disability inclusion is yet to be fully mainstreamed in all programme areas, particularly operations and humanitarian programming. To fulfill the aspirations of the policy and strategy, ESAR needs sustainable funding for disability-inclusive programming, robust commitment to utilize policies and tools and adequately trained focal points in each office, while recognizing that there are woefully few persons with disabilities working at UNICEF. There is also weak capacity at both government and implementing partner levels, with potential partners not having disability inclusion on their agenda or organizations of persons with disabilities themselves have limited capacity. Strong leadership and commitment of the senior management will be key to ensure disability inclusion is a priority agenda.  
 
ESARO turned challenges into opportunities to expand partnerships. In a highly competitive and challenging fundraising environment, ESARO pursued multiple pathways to attract and push for public and donor attention for the Horn of Africa drought, which turned into stronger partnerships with key donors, expansion into new donor bases, increased funding results and a new approach to combine emergency and resilience/nexus fundraising in one consolidated Horn of Africa Call to Action. New opportunities continue to arise to drive partnerships that merge public and private sector investments, such as in community resilience building and innovative financing. For example, UNICEF’s multi-region Today and Tomorrow initiative is an integrated climate change finance approach to address ongoing climate crisis impacts while preparing for future emergencies that includes ESAR countries. ESARO learned through new ways of working with the UNICEF West and Central Africa Regional Office on the Airtel Africa partnership, providing valuable coordination lessons. 2022 demonstrated that ESAR’s homegrown private sector can support in local emergencies but requires UNICEF to invest in digital fundraising infrastructure to maximize opportunities. 2022 also illustrated that business engagement is still not fully leveraged by COs and, despite great improvements, continues to be underrepresented in CO strategic documents.
 
On SBC, lessons learned and innovative systems, tools and partnerships built during COVID-19 were leveraged to respond to other public health emergencies, including Ebola, cholera and drought, and to accelerate SBC results in selected regional priority areas. For example, the collection and utilization of social listening and community feedback insights and time-series social and behavioural science data were critical to inform successful evidence-based programming. UNICEF leadership of RCCE coordination platforms along with Ministries of Health enabled rapid activity scale-up for data-driven, community-centered responses. Strategic partnerships with faith actors, RCCE actors and experts on social norms programming proved valuable across regional sectoral priorities. 
 
Partnering with regionally based academic institutions is an effective approach to locally ground innovations and better ensure that they are institutionalized. Examples include ESARO’s tripartite partnerships with the University of Zambia and IQVIA on mentoring government leaders in data analysis and use and the partnership with the Universities of Cape Town and Oxford on multisectoral drivers and mitigators of adolescent HIV and SRHR risk. In both cases, UNICEF brings programming expertise to the academic collaboration. ESARO also worked with the WHO country office of Somalia to commission a study carried out by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Imperial College London that presented retrospective estimates of mortality across Somalia in 2022. The study will inform a scenario-based forecast model to enable anticipatory action and avert drought-related deaths in the future.
 
Provided the resources and space, more mature youth organizations can excel at building the capacity of less developed youth-led organizations as exemplified in ESARO’s partnership with Y+, a network of young people living with HIV, where Y+ leaders are building the capacity of several national youth networks in ESAR on advocacy, resource mobilization and organizational development. Specific accomplishments included strengthened governing boards and internal policies, organizational strategy and proposal development, dissemination and partner commitments on ethical engagement of young people, and onward capacity building of sub-national networks.
 
In 2022, ESARO found success in enhancing its focus on helping governments improve budget credibility and execution to ensure value for money. This was achieved by: supporting a dozen COs to undertake diagnostic tools, including public expenditure reviews, public expenditure tracking surveys and procurement efficiency analyses; promoting open budget practices in 20 countries; and supporting related public finance management reforms, such as reviewing procurement laws. In Somalia and Zimbabwe, this agenda was boosted by the new regional partnership with the Collaborative Africa Budget Reform Initiative, whereby finance and social sector ministries were supported by “coaches” to unpack execution bottlenecks in their health and education budgets. 
 
Several positive experiences reaffirmed the importance of working together across sectoral areas. Investing in areas of convergence with programming and partnerships had many returns. For example, adolescent girls brought ESARO together around prevention and response to VAC, intimate partner violence, child marriage, adolescent pregnancy and HIV, as well as issues related to children on the move and girls’ education. Investments in ECD can similarly bring us together around programming and advocacy. Results were enhanced when sectors collaborated to co-create interventions and strategically utilize joint delivery platforms to influence change. For example, public finance and social protection interventions were strengthened in 2022 by working closely together with nearly every programme section, which enhanced results across sectors.

"
ESAR,Eswatini,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Programme implementation in 2022 at community level, as well as findings of some studies conducted by UNICEF or other partners demonstrated high prevalence of multiple deprivations among the most vulnerable children in Eswatini. For instance, an out-of-school child, with high probability comes from a poor family, facing issues with access to clean water and nutritious food, too. Addressing any one of these deprivations without attending to others does not yield the intended outcome. With this understanding, in some areas of intervention, UNICEF adopted a multi-stakeholder and multi-sectoral approach to deliver its results. This was, for example evident in bringing teenage pregnant girls back to school through provision of home visit programmes for mental health, and SRH and family planning. On the other hand, integration of immunization, new-born health, nutrition, and WASH services in one outreach programme not only made services accessible, but also increased efficiency of their delivery to a considerable extent. Therefore, in the next programming period, UNICEF will focus on a more integrated approach to programme delivery. Moreover, considering that UNICEF and partners will conduct the mid-term review of the current Country Programme, while engaging at the national level for policy advocacy, the Country Office will advocate for adoption of these integrated/convergent approaches on child-focused services and increase effectiveness, efficiency, and impact.
 
The continued economic impact of COVID-19 pandemic and the emerging economic challenges caused by the Ukraine war, negatively affected the ability of the Country Office to mobilize resources in some of the important areas of child deprivation in Eswatini. On the other hand, raising funds in some areas such as preparedness and response programmes for health emergencies have been successful. The Country Office used these opportunities to direct the available resources to system and capacity strengthening programmes with a larger scope. For example, COVID-19 response resources were successfully utilized to improve the cold chain system and the system for supply and distribution of oxygen in the country. These interventions not only improved COVID-19 response, but also increased capacity of the health sector for improved service delivery.
 
Despite having the highest HIV prevalence in the world, Eswatini is the only country in Africa that has reached and surpassed the 95-95-95 target. This is to a considerable extent due to the high-level of importance placed on HIV by the state, declaring it as a national emergency. With regards to violence against children and youth, the country is facing a major challenge: efforts made by Government, UN agencies and, other development partners and civil societies in improving policies and legislation, communications campaigns and community engagement do not show a significant reduction in occurrence of violence. Households, schools and communities are not safe for children, and communities are not adopting protective behaviour. Building on lessons learned in the HIV response, whereby high-level political will was paired with allocation of human and financial resources, partners including UNICEF started advocacy with the Parliament and the Deputy Prime Minister’s Office to adopt a similar approach in addressing violence. These efforts will continue in 2023 until intended result is achieved.
 
Meaningful adolescent and youth engagement and participation is still a challenge in Eswatini, and UNICEF is not an exception. Engagement opportunities have usually been limited to the annual commemorations of the Day of the African Child and International Day of the Girl Child, and other events of the kind. Occasionally there have been focus group discussions organized with young people on different thematic areas. Whilst these events are still good practice, there is need for more meaningful engagement and participation with adolescents to form and express their views and influence matters that concern them directly and indirectly. In the reporting period, UNICEF considerably increased the number of opportunities for engagement and at the same time initiated the process of establishing its Young Person’s Advisory Board that will inform programming and create platforms for increased child participation. The board is composed of 14 young people, between 15 to 23 years of age, ensuring gender balance, rural and urban representation, and as much ethnic diversity as possible. While moving on with engaging its Young Person’s Advisory Board, UNICEF has been approached by the UNRCO to make the Board a UN-wide forum. This is an opportunity to work better together but also to provide young people with a wider range of opportunities to be engaged.

ESAR,Ethiopia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons Learned
Joint planning and coordination with the GOE, UN agencies, international development agencies, and implementing partners proved to be an efficient approach to leverage financial and technical support and ensure effectiveness of programming. Notably, collaboration between UNICEF and other UN agencies led to joint funding and implementation to support maternal, newborn and child health projects. UNICEF cooperation with the Clinton Health Access Initiative supported cold chain maintenance and capacity development initiatives. Moreover, UNICEF signed cooperation agreements with NGO partners that resulted in the equitable access to quality education for hard-to-reach children. 
 
UNICEF leveraged innovative financing for RUTF from the Supply Division and a loan from Programme Division, totaling US$30 million, to frontload procurement of the life-saving supply and ensure availability throughout the year. The weekly infographic published by UNICEF on the nutrition situation maintained visibility of the critical situation, and shared the response progress and key gaps.
 
Close collaboration with international and local partners ensured community participation and results integration to improve the quality of SBC interventions. Internally, UNICEF thoroughly integrated participation, information and communication, feedback, and PSEA in all programme documents as part of Accountability to Affected Populations. Targeted population now have mechanisms to provide and receive feedback on services. In 2022, over 894,213 people provided feedback via community sessions, focus group discussions, and hotlines. Community dialogue proved to be the most effective approach in community engagement. For example, the dialogue on COVID-19 vaccination dramatically increased vaccine uptake during the third round of the national campaign. Moreover, in Tigray where transportation was a major challenge during the measles supplemental immunization activity, UNICEF engaged women’s development groups and grassroot community structures that mobilized locally available resources and ensured service access.
 
UNICEF also identified specific lessons in programming that will inform future actions. In WASH, the solarization of 24 water supply systems in Afar, Somali, Amhara, Oromia and SNNP regions proved to be effective in sustaining the operations of water supply schemes and reducing tariffs whilst improving service continuity for over 150,000 people. In education, investment on capacity development of local suppliers to manufacture play-based indoor and outdoor early learning materials was necessary due to insufficient play-based pedagogical skills of early childhood education personnel and a lack of age-appropriate curriculum materials jeopardized progress toward improving foundational literacy and numeracy skills of learners. In child protection, in light of the increased pressure on government systems to administer payments in more remote, insecure, and hard-to-reach areas, there is a need to assess the potential to scale-up more efficient and secure payment options for the shock-responsive cash transfer, including mobile payment. In social policy, UNICEF learned that generating awareness amongst senior regional government officials is a necessary precondition to ensure prioritization of child-focused expenditure, and this requires consistent high-level engagement. For example, the high-level engagement in the Somali region led to joint implementation with UNICEF on the child expenditure assessment. Internally, to strengthen UNICEF programming and response, systems, procedures, and processes need to be reoriented towards an accountability framework on disability inclusion for all staff members.
 
Innovations 
UNICEF employed different innovative strategies to strengthen programme implementation and expand results for children and women. UNICEF leveraged innovative financing of the Supply Division and a loan from Headquarters to ensure the availability of the lifesaving RUTF in Ethiopia.The Find and Treat campaign, conducted in the most inaccessible areas of Tigray, Amhara and Afar regions and drought-affected areas of Somali, Oromia and SNNP regions, successfully integrated rapid nutrition assessment with multisectoral rapid response. The implementation of the My Home/Bete approach allowed UNICEF to address interrelated needs on accelerated learning, skills development, and child protection. The use of satellite data for groundwater mapping to tap deep aquifers and improve the construction of multi-village water supply schemes disrupted the vicious cycle of recurrent displacements and loss of livelihoods due to the exposure to droughts. As Ethiopia is experiencing one of the most serve droughts in recent history, this climate-resilient solution supported over 50,000 people in hard-to-reach areas of Somali region to access reliable water supply. 
 
In terms of humanitarian and resilience programming, innovations focused on reaching the most at-need communities. UNICEF and WFP are developing a joint framework for building nutrition resilience, with integration of preventative and multisectoral direct and indirect nutrition interventions to ameliorate the impact of climate and economic shocks among the most vulnerable. The integrated host community-refugee WASH service delivery approach implemented in Gambella region was successful in building social cohesion between refugees and host communities, and significantly reduced the cost of producing water. The model is being replicated in the Somali region, and in Uganda, Somalia, and Sudan where an estimated 800,000 refugee and host communities will have access to improved water supply. Moreover, UNICEF supported the contextualization of the mobile-based technology for civil registration in refugee settings, and this is expected to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of the civil registration system in all refugee settings. The CPIMS+ web-based case management system was piloted to capture data for service provision, referrals, follow-ups, reporting and information sharing in refugee settings. Lastly, the interactive voice response messaging to women and girls was used to deliver life skills training to internally displaced girls and those in challenging situations. 
 
The preparatory work with the GOE was concluded to start the African Drone and Data Academy (ADDA) in Ethiopia in partnership with Ethiopian Airlines, Virginia Tech University, Ministry of Peace, and Ministry of Agriculture. With limited infrastructure and lack of local capacity, the ADDA will address these challenges, and effectively utilize the drone technology for development and humanitarian interventions. The ADDA, to be based in the Ethiopian Airlines Aviation Academy, will train young people on drone basics, logistics and planning, as well as drone data and geographic information system analytics. Government partners are planning to use the technology to monitor the drought situation, and improve humanitarian preparedness and response. 
 
UNICEF Ethiopia implemented a 0.25% allocation of incoming Other Resources funds to support evaluation priorities. This contributed to better service delivery for children and improved learning and accountability.
"
ESAR,Kenya,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The far-reaching effects of the continued drought led to an increased need for enhanced sector coordination in 2022. A mapping of both sector needs and funding gaps would likely lead to increased resource harnessing. Work done on this in the areas of health, nutrition, WASH, and Social Behaviour Change has led to the development of an integrated drought humanitarian programme document, and the design of a one-stop-shop for vulnerable communities receiving critical drought interventions. These integrated life-saving interventions included improved routine immunization coverage as well as COVID-19 vaccinations and increases in the number of children with Severe Acute Malnutrition treated through the outreach programme.
 
An election simulation exercise enabled UNICEF to test its systems and response preparedness and identify gaps to be addressed. This proved to be an effective mechanism for identifying the gaps that exist in contingency and preparedness plans. Absence of real time data is a challenge to effective emergency response measures, and it would be worthwhile to invest more in data generation and analysis for evidence-based decision making.
 
In the education sector, UNICEF's strategy has been to mobilise human resources and increase technical support to the MoE at the national and county level, including the establishment and training of EiE working groups in the 16 counties most affected by the drought. UNICEF leveraged its existing out of school programme implemented in 12 counties to reach OOSC as a result of the drought, allowing an immediate response to the needs of children impacted by the drought.
 
The drought has also highlighted the need to strengthen the operation and maintenance of boreholes which could be managed by improving training of local people.
 
Comprehensive adolescent health and wellbeing policies, which address the emerging triple threat of adolescent pregnancies, new HIV infections and GBV, require a multi-sectoral approach to provide a cohesive response. To implement a successful adolescent programme, there needs to be strong advocacy and Social and Behavior Change (SBC) components, as well as a monitoring and evaluation framework.  It needs to consider health issues as a result of increased cases of violence, drug and substance use and abuse, and poor nutrition. There are also cultural considerations when developing guidelines, tools and curricula in terms of their appropriateness and acceptability within certain communities.
 
During the drought emergency response, Child Protection Volunteers (CPVs), working alongside sub-county children’s officers, have been crucial in delivering and improving essential protection services. CPVs and other community volunteers have often provided support across multiple sectors, hence it was effective to offer integrated training, covering health, nutrition, child protection and HIV. The government, however, is yet to budget for their renumeration, instead considering them ‘volunteers’ and therefore unpaid. Long term, this arrangement is risky. Continued advocacy for them to be paid is required.
 
To further enhance reporting of child abuse, violence and cases of FGM, UNICEF worked with the Anti-FGM board to develop the PASHA mobile App for reporting, tracking and actioning cases of FGM. A key lesson learnt was the need to develop a non-internet-based functionality of the PASHA App to enable the use of Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) codes in areas without internet coverage.
 
Another key innovation in 2022 was the Chatbot App, which UNICEF supported the government on, to address mental health and psychosocial needs of youths and adolescents. The success of the Chatbot initiative will mean many adolescents will be able to receive mental health and psychosocial support, and Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) and VAC information including on Online Child Sexual and Exploitation Abuse (OCSEA).
 
UNICEF also supported Social Intelligence Reporting (SIR), an innovative tool to support social budgeting and accountability. SBC strengthened its partnership with the Inter-Religious Council of Kenya (IRCK) in 2022 to access community feedback as a mechanism to improve service delivery and increase transparency.
 
UNICEF partnered with UN Women to integrate gender and public finance for children. Several opportunities for improving gender equity have been developed.
 
The inequality study by Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), which will be published in 2023, now has a full chapter on the gender dimensions of inequality. The Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) report 2022 by the National Treasury has a full annex on gender dimensions of public expenditure. UNICEF and UN Women jointly supported the two most important public finance reporting systems i.e. the Standard Chart of Accounts (SCOA) and the Controller of Budget Management Information System (CoBMIS), which report on children, gender and climate change expenditures.
 
UNICEF also played a leadership role in driving last-mile school connectivity, doubling the number of schools connected to 257 in 2022 from 100 in 2021, reaching 114,000 learners. Lessons from this have gone on to inform the government during the scaling up of its efforts for school connectivity with the ICT Authority in Kenya. Furthermore, UNICEF supported the scaling up of digital platforms for youth engagement and participation, including Yunitok and YOMA, reaching 110,000 young people with information on COVID-19, education, entrepreneurship, and training.
 
Finally, to support workplace culture and align staff behavior with UNICEF values, the office implemented office-wide internal communication initiatives and campaigns and launched the Spectrum of Behavior tool, developed to ensure core values are reflected in the way staff work and interact with colleagues. 
"
ESAR,Lesotho,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF continued to adjust programmes to respond to the enduring challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic and, subsequently, the relaxing of lockdown restrictions on movement since early 2022. some good practices learned during the COVID-19 lockdown, such as remote and hybrid work, zoom meetings, and SMS-based surveys, were used as appropriate. 
 
UNICEF has leveraged COVID-19 investments to strengthen routine immunisation and broader health systems. It entailed the development of a community health information system and a national georeferenced Community health worker master list to improve community health services governance and structure. UNICEF also leveraged COVID-19 investments to equip maternal and newborn wards for pediatric intensive care services. 
 
In immunisation, a key lesson was on the transition from excel based to the electronic vaccine Stock Management Tool for all vaccines, including ancillary supplies, which proved to be helpful for both management of cold chain equipment and supplies. 
 
UNICEF supported the National University of Lesotho Innovation Hub in developing three designs of hand hygiene stations. These stations, produced and installed in nine locations for testing, are now ready to be marketed. 
 
Social accountability to support the demand for services is a strategic intervention that UNICEF applies beyond HIV services. It is now being incorporated into other programmatic interventions such as nutrition and adolescent health. In addition, through the strategic initiative UNICEF is collaborating with the Global Fund, lessons and opportunities for improving livelihoods and economic empowerment of adolescent girls and young women have been identified for scale-up. 
 
The use of technology in education and child protection is emerging as a possible solution to address issues such as continuity of learning, inclusive education, and support for survivors of SGBV to overcome the stigma and fear of seeking help. UNICEF collaborated with MOET to strengthen learning passports and procure assistive technology for teachers and children who can take them to all schools. Similarly, the use of mobile apps for prevention and availability of services to survivors of SGBV can be taken to scale. Building on the lessons learned during the pandemic and alternative teaching and learning modalities, UNICEF invested in improving institutional capacity in digital learning platforms at the LCE for learning continuity of the ECE Diploma and Certificate trainings. 
 
A U-Report poll targeting 12–17-year-olds was conducted between December 2021 and January 2022. As a result, 1,070 responses informed the social media campaign targeting AYP and parents/caregivers on the benefits of both COVID-19 and HPV vaccines, with the best-performing social media post reaching 23,609 people. As a result, UNICEF adopted the social media strategy to mobilize AYP. 
 
A community feedback tool is being piloted to collect data to measure the adoption of health-seeking behaviors and community trust in and uptake healthcare services. As of November 30, 2023, responses have been collected through focus group discussions and Kobo Collect App. A key lesson was community volunteers' importance in collecting and linking this data to health facilities. The database yielded through this platform will be linked to DHIS2 and the community health information system under development. 
 
Another important lesson was engaging the men population in health and nutrition, immunisation, and WASH issues, for instance, working with 45 initiation schools. 
 
Regarding social protection, the development and consultation process for the National Social Assistance Strategy, as previously for the National Social Protection Strategy II, showed not only the importance of a solid facilitation process for developing strategic documents but also the active involvement of crucial GOL stakeholders at every stage of the development process. This is so even if this requires a revision of planned timelines. Similarly, solid coordination and a clear division of labor among stakeholders are critical to success. Finally, it is also essential that all government counterparts are in the driving seat of these processes and not merely as participants. 
 
While supporting efforts to improve public finance for children, it was essential to hold consultations for the next fiscal year's budget well in advance so that citizen views could be meaningfully reflected in the budget documents. In addition, holding regular meetings to discuss and solve issues regarding the annual work plan has been instrumental in ensuring the implementation of activities. Lastly, the best way to work together in this area was to build trust and keep good relationships with key ministries like the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning (former MOF and MODP) and other ministries, departments, and agencies. 
"
ESAR,Madagascar,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"At year end, UNICEF received draft recommendations from the evaluation of its response to the Level 2 drought emergency in the Great South. Generally, the evaluation found UNICEF’s response to be relevant, efficient and effective, with several key learning points: 
- Accountability to Affected Populations, in particular UNICEF communication to beneficiaries about the scope of its response, and inclusion of beneficiaries (particularly women and children) in programme monitoring and design, needs to be reinforced. 
- The emergency response was not sufficiently gender-responsive and did not adequately address the problems of violence against children and women. Stronger, multisectoral approaches are needed in the future.
- WASH, Nutrition, cash transfer and child protection interventions were relevant and effective during the L2, however, they could have been more coherent and coordinated, and this might have led to improved results. 

UNICEF learned that the raising of the corporate emergency status had a positive effect on visibility, but in the end, it did not bring in the kind of new financial resources that UNICEF might have been hoping for. UNICEF also learned how to position itself as the key generator and broker of evidence, and this is a position it would hope to extend to other areas of work going forward. 

Vaccinating the population of Madagascar against COVID-19 was a challenge this year, and the results of UNICEF and partners’ efforts have been worrying, since only 8 per cent of the total population has been vaccinated. A high-level visit from headquarters was useful for mobilizing and motivating national actors at the highest level, including the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health, and resources and pledges were made accordingly. CO also learned that engaging partners outside the health sector can be beneficial to raise awareness and change behaviors regarding vaccination: for instance, working with the Ministries of Tourism and Education (vaccinating to allow tourists to visit Madagascar, vaccinating to allow schools to reopen), as well as with traditional and religious leaders in order to reposition and strengthen the demand for vaccinations. Given challenges related to cultural practices which characterize Madagascar’s population, differentiated approaches requiring strong SBC contributions have to be embedded in operational micro-planning for COVID-19 vaccination. 

UNICEF Madagascar participated in a HQ-led and RO-facilitated pilot project for the Global Knowledge Management strategy. The focus of this pilot was to promote knowledge sharing culture in a country office, including required tools, practices and human resources.  As a result of this pilot, the CO instigated a field reporting tool, a monthly Programme Coordination Meeting with dedicated time for crosscutting discussions, sharing sessions on completed evaluations, and developed a CO newsletter.

Setting up field offices has been an important shift and a learning experience with plenty of opportunity to understand what needs to be done better in the future. Efforts will need to be made to strengthen coordination and information sharing so that Field Office Chiefs can play more of a representative role in the region and advance intersectoriality, a key strategy of the Country Programme. From a logistical perspective, the Country Office will want to explore how to decentralise authority further to Field Offices, giving them more control over fleet management, missions approval, petty cash, and some programmatic budget responsibilities.  

Learning from failures: the functional assessment tool for disability that UNICEF introduced in 2022 for social protection programming is a complex instrument for a context with extremely low administrative and human resources capacity. The tool was proposed by an international firm hired by UNICEF based on previous experience in another country. Its adaptation to Madagascar did not sufficiently account for the logistical and administrative challenges of the country. The tool will be revised in 2023 to make it more suitable for rural areas in Madagascar with the support of local associations and NGOs. In the future, UNICEF will be more cautious whenever partners propose standardized cross-country approaches with limited local context diagnostics.
 
Innovations
In 2022, UNICEF in Madagascar collaborated with the Innocenti Office of Research to conduct two innovative pieces of work within the framework of the “Data Must Speak” initiative. The first, the “Positive Deviance” project, sought to understand the drivers behind exceptional performance in certain schools selected from a random sample. The second, “Teachers for All” investigates how countries allocate teachers to schools and how that process might be more efficiently managed.  
 
Supply chain reflections as part of Health Systems Strengthening was an innovation in 2022. UNICEF implemented the Maturity Model to evaluate the national public health supply chain including vaccines, essential medicines, and nutrition supplies. UNICEF co-financed the National Supply Chain Assessment (NSCA) with USAID and contributed to the Sustainably Readiness Assessment Tool (SRAT) from UNFPA to further develop evidence on the supply chain. Further engagement with the MoH and key implementing partners such as UNFPA, WHO, USAID, EU (TeamEurope Group), France etc. are ongoing in positioning the Public Health Supply Chain as a strategic element. Madagascar is working now on a draft national public health supply chain strategy to be embedded in the CR-RSS (Select Committee - Health System Strengthening) at the level of the Secretary General of the MoH and under the lead of the CFO MoH, EU and France. 
 
Under the lead of WASH, Supply implemented a new way of doing service contracting with the private sector for the water provision. With the project “Investisseur-Constructeur-Gestionaires” the private sector is asked to co-finance up to 15% the water construction work. Allowing the private sector then to contract a maintenance contract with the government for 10 or more years. A good practice to be brought to scale in other areas.
"
ESAR,Malawi,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF applied a lifecycle approach to influence results for children through solid partnerships. In Malawi, the strategic implementation of various interventions through close partnerships and coordination within programme teams and partners was a decisive success factor in achieving programme objectives and promoting efficiency, transparency, visibility and sustainability. This was evidenced by the implementation of the iron–folic acid intervention for adolescents in conjunction with the United Nations Joint Programme on Girls' Education (JPGE III), which enabled UNICEF and the Department of Nutrition, HIV and AIDS to leverage efforts and accelerate impact.
 
The Country Programme Evaluation (2022) found that the Malawi country programme 2019–2023 achieved its results through close coordination with the Government of Malawi across all programme pillars. A key learning was that for innovations to succeed and be brought to scale, they need to be piloted with good practices identified in a particular context.  For example, the Intelligent Community Health Information System (iCHIS) was deployed in Kasungu District following a successful pilot in 2021. Scaling up pilots can bring about lasting changes in the situation of children at the societal level.

Short-term and reactive emergency responses can save lives in Malawi, where communities experience frequent shocks. But the longer-term development effects of such responses are limited and can only occur when emergency and humanitarian actions are included as a key part of the overall country programme planning.
 
Early screening for functional difficulties was another approach that worked well. The intervention helped identify children at risk for potential health, developmental or social-emotional problems and get them the assistance they would need to prevent them from falling behind in school. 
 
UNICEF support for strengthened inventory management and end-user supply monitoring helped reduce the misuse of supplies and stock-outs and increase children’s timely access to life-saving supplies, such as ready-to-use therapeutic foods for treating severe acute malnutrition.
 
Empowering communities leads to improved health outcomes. For example, caregivers were oriented on using mid-upper arm circumference tapes to assess their children's nutrition status and the urgent need to refer those children with acute malnutrition for treatment.  The empowerment activity contributed to the early identification, timely treatment and improved treatment outcomes of children with acute malnutrition.

Strategic investment and capacity building can enhance the resiliency of government social protection delivery systems and ensure they are effectively leveraged to respond to emergencies. For example, the national harmonized e-payment system was efficiently leveraged to disburse cash during the 2021/22 lean season drought response in Ntcheu District, which reduced delivery costs from 10 per cent to 2.5 per cent of the overall response budget.

Social and behaviour change interventions were effective and more sustainable when accompanied by improvements in service provision and the ongoing engagement of families and communities. 26,864 children (14,622 girls) were protected from violence, abuse, exploitation, neglect and the impact of HIV. 
 
In the WASH sector, challenges include the high costs of maintaining WASH facilities and infrastructure. A financial analysis for the WASH sector in Malawi, supported by UNICEF using the SDG costing tool, concluded that annual progress towards the country's 2030 targets on water and sanitation would require the sector to pursue a range of financial solutions and investments of around USD 97 million per year, which is unobtainable within the current economic context. 
 
Innovation initiatives such as using drones ""for good"" can accelerate results for children. Below are some examples of innovations that contributed to results in 2022:
 

 
UNICEF and Airtel Africa     used their assessment of the digital education landscape to inform the     development of a roadmap and establish the next steps in the Reimagine     Education digital learning initiative and Giga reaching approximately     500,000 learners. 
UNICEF supported an     impact-based flood forecasting project targeting flood-prone districts and     communities in northern Malawi. Aerial imagery was collected and used to     inform programmatic needs, which will, in the future, benefit     approximately 3.5 million people in need.  
UNICEF assisted the     Ministry of Education in developing a learning management system as part     of its electronic continuing professional development programme for     teachers in Malawi. The programme is hosted on the government's vast area     network; teachers in rural areas can access it through their low-level     smartphones. All teachers can access this service.  
UNICEF and the Jesuit     Refugee Service supported the launch of Connect My School, a pilot project     that seeks to expand digital education opportunities for disadvantaged     groups and communities, including children in refugee camps, reaching over     7,000 children. 
 
Some 105 young people (42 women) graduated in 2022 from the African Drone and Data Academy, a UNICEF–Government of Malawi joint initiative whose mission is to build 21st-century skills among Africa's youth. Since 2020, when the academy was established at the Malawi University of Science and Technology, 913 people have graduated from the course. They received specialized training in flying drones, using drones to deliver development and humanitarian programming interventions, and supporting data analysis and gathering activities, such as aerial photography. 
 
Evaluation of the multipurpose use of Drones indicated that drones could be used across different sectors and multiple activities in remote settings in support of humanitarian and development activities. The innovative use of drones in Malawi's Kasungu District is a good example of how drones can be used in development programming. Here, drones collected and delivered laboratory samples, vaccines, essential medicines and other commodities. 
"
ESAR,Namibia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Procurement accounts for almost half of the budget for the MoHSS and has been hampered by inefficiencies for a long time. Through partnership between Health, Social Policy and Supply, UNICEF Namibia in 2021 supported review of existing analytic work and consensus-building between the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Health and Social Services around resolving the bottlenecks and challenges affecting pharmaceutical and clinical supplies procurement. The consensus building process produced 11 recommendations for reform that cut across regulatory framework, public finance management, information systems and procurement processes. 
In 2022, the regulatory framework recommendations were incorporated in the revision of the Procurement Act (passed in September 2022), including provisions for pooled procurement, framework agreements and emergency procurement management. Regulations for pooled procurement and framework agreements are currently being developed. In 2022, UNICEF jointly with UNDP seconded a technical expert to the Ministry of Finance as a Project Manager who advises the 2 Ministers responsible for Finance and Health, supports operationalization of the procurement reforms in the Public Procurement Act, and facilitates continued coordination and consensus-building on PFM/procurement challenges and efficiency-enhancing measures through a reference group co-chaired by the 2 Ministries. Upon full implementation, the reforms will help ensure efficient procurement of pharmaceutical and clinical supplies for improved availability and outcomes, including for children. UNICEF’s support to procurement reforms in Namibia offers a best practice on how to broker dialogue and find lasting solutions between different Government departments on behalf of children. It is featured as an example of successful brokering in UNICEF’s “Global resource kit for Engaging with PFM challenges in the health sector”, released in December 2022. 
Several lessons were drawn for the first integrated COVID-19, childhood immunization, nutrition, birth registration and social protection campaign. 
a)      An integrated campaign provides an opportunity to reach unreached children with multiple services, optimizing the value of service to the child and the family. This value addition of integration in delivering basic rights to children in unreached communities is demonstrated by the issuance of birth certificates to 2258 children and the enrolment of 891 eligible children for social grants. 
b)      Integration enables resource optimization including the sharing of vehicles, and mutual benefit from demand creation efforts
c)      While there were concerns about the potential spill-over of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy to resistance of childhood immunization (and indeed few cases of such examples were noted), the turn-out for children was not significantly adversely affected, with the campaign reaching 94 per cent coverage for measles-rubella. However, the high acceptance of childhood immunization did not seem to improve the uptake of COVID-19 vaccination when offered as one package. Far less adults were immunized against COVID-19 than planned, and only slightly more than the average monthly coverage building up to the campaign. 
d)      Managing messaging for immunization efforts targeting different age groups and for which acceptance levels significantly differ is complicated. It requires more advance planning than typical, frequent, and consistent communication through all available avenues, and would benefit from additional social and behavioural change expertise in-country for an extended period. 
e)      Operational processes for administering and recording COVID-19 vaccination are significantly lengthier and more complex than administering other vaccines to children, which seemed to demotivate both service providers and parents bringing children in some instances. 
COVID-19 vaccination risk communication and community engagement to learners was also integrated with messaging on gender-based violence and learner pregnancies. Combining COVID-19 vaccination messages for learners with addressing gender-based violence and learner pregnancies proved to be effective in getting learners to discuss issues affecting them.
Having produced the report on multidimensional poverty in 2021, in 2022 UNICEF customized the report through regional poverty profiles and supported the dissemination of the findings in 12 of the 14 Regions. This customized engagement with sub-national governance structures was key in driving the reform agenda for child-poverty reduction and better budget prioritization. This helped raise awareness on the situation of children in each of the regions and drew the attention of policy makers towards strategies to reduce child poverty in all its dimensions as articulated in SDG1. It was through these advocacy efforts that UNICEF secured commitment from all the 12 regional authorities to include child multidimensional poverty indicators in their regional development plans and inputs to the upcoming NDP6, and to use the tool for budgeting and advocacy.
A continuing lesson is the meaningful involvement and participation of young people and persons with disabilities while consulting on issues of national importance. UNICEF supported the MoEAC to ensure disability-inclusion in national consultations and the national conference for transforming education, specifically through the engagement of sign language translators for this critical intervention to address the learning crisis in Namibia. In addition, leveraging the UNCT sub-pillar on Education and Skills facilitated high collaborative engagement of the UNCT and the GRN on national preparations for the Transforming Education Summit. While the partnership between UNICEF and the MoEAC was instrumental in this process, Government owned the entire process, including excellent planning and coordination of the TES pre-summit meeting in June and the TES in September 2022. UNICEF’s assistance maximized our comparative advantages to support the national consultations, the National Conference and TES. 
Leveraging cross-sectoral multiple partnerships, UNICEF has facilitated a partnership between Side-by-Side Early Intervention Centre (SbS) and UNAM, resulting in a Memorandum of Understanding to incorporate theoretical and practical disability-inclusion in the pre-service education of cross-sectoral university students. This will contribute to a workforce who understand the rights of children with disability and are proactive in disability-inclusive services to enable fulfilment of these rights.
UNICEF supported the Namibia Institute for Pathology to implement a Medical Drones project that will improve turn-around times for blood tests in order to strengthen early diagnosis and treatment for HIV-infected mothers in 2 regions with hard-to-reach communities, currently delayed by regulatory authorization challenges. UNICEF used the annual review meeting with partners to share new evidence such as WASH evaluation and SITAN report, to advance knowledge on the situation of children and inform future partnership priorities.  "
ESAR,Republic of Mozambique,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"With an outcome-focused approach per the revised innovation and digital transformation strategy for the country programme 2022-2026, innovation and digital transformation activities continued to contribute to programme results. The country office surpassed the target, reaching more than 500,000 end-users.  The Internet of Good Things had 322,921 unique visitors, and SMS-BIZ gained 134,419 new U-Reporters (49,068 women; 76,321 men). Community health workers used the upSCALE Android app to diagnose, treat or refer 147,689 registered patients (62,120 women; 56,315 men), representing a 59 per cent increase from 2021. Innovative activities include the design and development of the Instituto Nacional de Gestão e Redução do Risco de Desastres (INGD)'s new web portal, which incorporates machine learning, big data, and automated forecasting and risk assessment to strengthen existing emergency, monitoring and response measures. UNICEF is also rolling out the first phase of the End-User Supply Monitoring System to help ensure supplies reach affected populations promptly. Elsewhere, MINEDH endorsed implementing the GIGA initiative to map connectivity of schools and explore sustainable finance models. Importantly, UNICEF Mozambique became only the seventh office in the ESA region to carry out WHO's Assistive Technology Capacity Assessment. Finally, UNICEF supported MGCAS to launch the first eLearning platform dedicated to strengthening the capacities of social workers.  
  
In 2022, UNICEF advocated, based on a 2021 Impact and Process Evaluation of the Child Grant 0-2 Component in the Nampula Province in Mozambique (2019-2021) to expand the Child Grant program. The Child Grant (0-2 Years) is a sub-component of the Basic Social Subsidy Programme (PSSB) of the Government of Mozambique, managed by the Ministry of Gender, Children, and Social Action (MGCAS).  UNICEF supported its design and implementation during its start-up phase, which began in 2018. MGCAS subsequently requested UNICEF to commission impact and process evaluations to inform the future government programming. UNICEF Mozambique was actively engaged in all phases of the evaluation and ensured full ownership and validation of these evaluations by MGCAS and INAS. The main recommendations of the 2021 evaluations were to scale-up the Child grant in two phases (Phase 1: An expansion of coverage to 250,000 beneficiaries in the period 2022-2024, within nine provinces and 59 districts, with secured funding (UNICEF, World Bank, state budget) to reach approximately 165,000 beneficiaries. The decision of the Government of Mozambique to expand the Child grant in 2022 represents a key success resulting from UNICEF advocacy efforts. Phase 2 will see a further expansion to an additional 250,000 beneficiaries in the period 2024-2026.   
  
UNICEF partnered with private sector stakeholders to advance children’s rights in Mozambique. Through partnership with Mobile Network Operators, UNICEF reached 1 million subscribers through the Internet of Good Things (#BoaInternet) with Vodacom, and 450,000 SMS BIZ users (U-Reporters) in partnership with Vodacom, TMCel, and Movitel. Through a global partnership with the Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation, a joint-pilot initiative was launched with the GoM and partners to digitize import and clearance processes to fast-track imports of vaccines and rapid test kits.  
  
The transition from the old CPD to the new one has given rise to some internal challenges. The CPMP required the recruitment of 57 positions. In some field-based positions, recruitments were advertised multiple times and the office is still facing challenges in identifying adequately qualified candidates.  IThis has caused additional work and delayed the process of fully implementing the new CPD. Likewise, the transition from programming with nationwide focus to a a more targeted approach, focusing on four provinces required a shift in operating modalities and mindset. Progressive programme phase-out has been easier in some areas and for some activities, and more challenging for others. Nonetheless, the office continues to make efforts to harmonize, streamline, and improve collaboration across sections to have an integrated life-cycle approach.  
  
In order to foster its own decentralization process, and achieve greater convergence at field level, UNICEF Mozambique has prioritized the reinforcement of field offices, with the formal establishment of two additional field offices, expansion and stabilization of staffing in all four field offices (with 33 posts of the new CPMP at provincial office level), and in terms of visibility and leadership. In all four priority provinces, UNICEF held presentations of the CPD, the rolling workplans and the CRRP. This enabled staff to liaise with provincial and district authorities, present UNICEF Mozambique’s new life-cycle approach, and explain the rationale behind the geographical targeting and selection of priority districts which will be the focus on UNICEF’s work for the CPD.
"
ESAR,Rwanda,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Research was a catalyst for accelerated development in several areas.  As Chair of the Scaling Up Nutrition UN group, UNICEF collaborated with USAID (Chair of the SUN DP group) and NCDA to plan a research colloquium showcasing four new studies on stunting and nutrition financing.  The event resulted in a multi-ministry action plan for short- and long-term steps to reduce stunting. The final evaluation of the JP on Social Protection strengthened the evidence base for investing in integrated social protection interventions, and lessons learned will support the implementation of the National Strategy for Sustainable Graduation adopted by the Cabinet in 2022. In a deliberate effort to generate evidence to inform programming on the prevention of and response to VAC, UNICEF commissioned a desk study covering both the social and gender norms condoning violence and broader drivers of VAC, contributing to much needed data sources for future programming in GBV and VAC. 

Collaboration with sister UN Agencies on joint programmes yielded improvements for children.  UNICEF coordinated the Joint Programme on Social Protection with WFP and FAO.  UNICEF and WFP planned joint social protection interventions and organized a follow-up retreat to map out new joint activities and resource mobilization opportunities.  With UNDP in the Integrated National Financing Framework joint programme, the UNICEF-supported fiscal space analysis fed into the full INFF recommendations. The GIGA project benefitted from ITU’s regulatory and technical expertise. UNICEF and UNHCR collaborated to develop and implement the Blueprint for Joint Action for Refugee Children. UNICEF also worked with UNHCR in the development of the Rwanda Refugee Response Plan.  UNICEF hosts ILO and UNESCO staff in our premises in Kigali.

UNICEF innovations were once again scaled up by other partners.  For example, USAID provided USD 38 million to a Catholic Relief Services (CRS)-led consortium to roll out the nutrition approach that combines VSLAs, ECD centres, and home gardens.  In social protection, a model combining livelihood empowerment pathways, seed funding, VSLAs, psycho-social support from the community workforce enhanced the resilience of vulnerable and food-insecure households. This model has been adopted and is being rolled out by the Government and partners. 

Digital technology continued to make programmes more efficient and effective. UNICEF’s coordination and advocacy brought together the World Bank, USAID, Enabel and JICA to integrate community health worker training on the CHW multi-topic package, eLearning and RapidPro, which is expected to be scaled up in all 30 districts by the end of 2023. UNICEF supported the development and finalization of the Vaccine Management Stock module under the DHIS2 in partnership with the University of Oslo and HISP under MOH guidance. All vaccines can now be monitored, requested, distributed and reported via electronic tools. UNICEF contributed to the roll-out to all 511 health facilities of an eTracker for routine immunization and COVID-19 vaccinations. The eTracker is linked with children’s birth registration. The Giga programme provided Internet connectivity in 63 pilot schools, plus digital contents development and digital skill capacity building of teachers.  The Disability Management Information System (DMIS) jointly supported by UNICEF, GIZ and other partners is close to finalization and is being tested in selected districts. 

UNICEF took new measures to protect the environment. The Rwanda Country Office was the first UN Agency in Rwanda to procure a hybrid vehicle, and a second vehicle will be operational in early 2023.  The office also began a recycling programme and kicked off a Climate Landscape Analysis for Children, the findings of which will be shared widely and used for new programming in 2023.  Finally, the WASH team initiated climate-resilient programming by reinforcing water systems to withstand floods and installing solar-powered water systems in areas prone to climate-induced infrastructure damage.

Young personnel added ideas and energy to the UNICEF Rwanda team.  Three interns and four UN Volunteers joined the team and played key roles in analyzing and presenting data, preparing briefing notes, drafting social media inputs, managing child protection activities, and preparing reports.  The office plans to add more interns and UN Volunteers to the team in 2023.
"
ESAR,Somalia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Goal 1 Survive and Thrive 
The network of social mobilisers working on polio eradication was critical in generating demand for the COVID-19 vaccination acceleration campaigns and the integrated measles campaign. This showed how social mobilisers can be instrumental in the delivery of integrated life-saving interventions at scale. Also, tailored-demand strategies targetting specific population groups, such as women, including female health workers, was important in addressing the gender gap in the uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine. The targetting of women resulted in the almost doubling of the vaccine uptake among women from 25 per cent in 2021 to 45 per cent in 2022.
Simplified approaches can be critical for results: In eight hard-to-reach areas, UNICEF, with support from the Regional Office and the Global Nutrition Cluster, developed standard simplified approach protocols for the treatment of both moderate and severe wasting, using just one product of the Ready-To-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) in the range. The protocol has been instrumental in providing partner guidance while helping to prevent the misuse of RUTF.
Goal 2 Education 
Whilst there have been considerable investments across sector partners to improve children’s enrolment in primary school, there has not yet been a corresponding investment in strengthening foundational primary curriculum approaches. To reinforce children’s acquisition of foundational learning skills, UNICEF initiated an accelerated early literacy and numeracy pedagogical package with federal ministries of education and TaRL  (Teaching at the Right Level) Africa, to be implemented at scale both in a developmental context in Somaliland and in an emergency context in the federal member states. 
 
Goal 3 Protection 
Preventing child recruitment is effective when dialogue with parties to the conflict is complemented by targeted humanitarian responses. Sustained efforts with the Somali National Army (SNA) have resulted in a decrease in violations by the SNA, including recruitment and use. However, instances of killing and maiming and sexual violence by federal and regional State actors remain high. 
 
Goal 4 Safe and Clean Environment 
  
Access to the full package of basic WASH services in schools and health facilities requires a multi-purpose water supply system tied to surrounding communities’ livelihoods to secure a return on investments. Yet the current focus is mostly on life-saving WASH support in AWD/Cholera treatment centres and drought-affected community service improvements  which do not always include schools. Further Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) studies and compliance are needed to identify entry points for the multipurpose water supply systems.  
   
Pre-positioning of the core emergency pipeline of emergency hygiene kit supplies for partners across the country has proved to be effective in fast tracking the response to disease outbreaks. Throughout the year, emergency supplies were pre-positioned by UNICEF across nine regional supply hubs. 
 
Goal 5 Equitable chance in Life 
Programmes need to take into account political transitions in fragile countries like Somalia. UNICEF’s approach to remaining institutionally engaged with key government counterparts, such as the Office of the Prime Minister, through the long electoral period and transfer of power, has put UNICEF in a better position with the Government compared to that of other partners. 
        "
ESAR,South Africa,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The creative and strategic use of data to inform communication and related advocacy played an important role in driving media and online ‘thought leadership’ work. This included maximizing U-Report poll findings to spark discussion and debate on the latest ‘youth pulse’ whilst also engaging with academia and official Government statistics, such as Police data, to strengthen advocacy for the most vulnerable children, such as orphans and those at high risk of violence. Building U-Report poll responses into programmatic work, such as the mental health roundtable, also provided critical inputs to inform the response and potential new partnerships.

Similarly, a key contributor to results specifically on PMTCT and immunization has been the analysis and use of data for programming. To identify, prioritize and respond in the low uptake districts and facilities, DoH and UNICEF used facility level data to understand low performing facilities and provide targeted technical support. To strengthen national immunization system, UNICEF has supported the DOH to identify the locations of zero-dose children, to understand the reasons of zero dose communities as well as defining strategies to reduce the barriers and improve immunization coverage and equity.
 
In Education, while the launch of the UN-joint programme, Education Plus was highly successful and called for more advocacy on the topic, there is a need to further strengthen the partnership among the UN agencies involved and deliver concrete coordinated interventions together with the government
 
UNICEF is stepping up its efforts to offer technical assistance to the government with regard to the implementation of fiscal policies by advocating for the strengthening of the taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages, adoption of front-of-pack labelling, restriction of marketing of unhealthy foods for children, and improvement of the school food environment.

In previous NSP for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis (TB) and sexual transmitted infections (STIs) children have not been identified as priority or key target population. To advocate prioritization of children in the new NSP on HIV/AIDS, TB and STIs, UNICEF jointly with UNAIDS and WHO supported consultations with relevant child related sectors. This proved to be far more effective when ensuring the active participation of civil society which revitalized the children’s sector and advocated prioritization of children in the new NSP on HIV/AIDS, TB and STIs.

The sustainable operation and maintenance of communal handwashing stations in vulnerable communities relies on the local water services authority (WSA). Where the local WSA has accepted responsibility for the stations, such as in the City of Johannesburg, the stations continue to be filled with water. In areas where the WSA does not assume responsibility, the stations are not filled and have, in some cases, been vandalized.   A key lesson has been the importance of engaging community level stakeholders and local structures for identifying needs and priorities, including capacities in managing and sustaining initiatives.

UNICEF is a lead partner in the DOH RCCE Technical Working Group (TWG) on several workstreams. To improve coordination around community feedback, UNICEF advocated through the RCCE TWG and partners to ensure that district, provincial and national levels respond in a coordinated and coherent manner, and that feedback is used to inform response at all levels. Accordingly, strategic partnerships have further strengthened RCCE and Social Behavior Change programming and supported the systemic coordination of programmes at a community-level.

In response to the KwaZulu Natal emergency, UNICEF ensured alignment with the government response mechanisms to ensure consideration toward the short-term as well as recovery and development phases. Although coordination was challenging across national, subnational and local implementing partners, a key lesson has been how efforts in coordination has paid off in the emergency recovery phase allowing opportunities for further collaboration around learning remediation and quality improvement initiatives benefiting the entire sector.

The development of a SRHR dashboard for district utilization has been a key innovation that has generated interest and ownership at the provincial and district levels of implementation. The consultation process has been key to enable ownership and buy-in of the dashboard. District level authorities’ use of the dashboards allowed the identification of where the needs are as it pertained to the realization of adolescent girls and young women’s SRHR. It therefore became pertinent to engage at sub-district levels as well and developing contextual plans and priorities to address issues of inequity, especially in the uThukela and Nelson Mandela Districts.

Towards addressing drivers of VAC, a key innovation has been in extending UNICEF’s parenting programme through the development of multilingual chatbot.  In partnership with government, academia and CSO, a Whatsapp-based interactive platform that provides parenting tips for parents with children of varying ages in multiple languages with potential to reach thousands of parents and caregivers was developed.

For ensuring safe access to services for children on the move in communities, an effective lesson has been in ensuring needs based inclusive strategies that can also strengthen social cohesion in communities. Targeting all children who are in need of care and protection regardless of their migratory status can be first step towards reinforcing social cohesion within the communities in contexts where xenophobia has been on the rise, fueled by lack of access to services and poverty.

The continued partnership with the lead department, DSD through the one United Nations Joint Programme on Social Protection, is proving instrumental in getting well considered social protection proposals to be endorsed at the highest policy and political levels. Constructive and strategic partnerships with civil society and National Treasury on the shape and size of public finance interventions around social protection are expected to yield results in 2023. 

UNICEF is on the forefront of ensuring evaluations and evidence are core part of its programming thus ensuring government participation in the processes is critical. Towards this, keeping evaluation contracts open after completion of the evaluation allows additional scope for government counterparts to provide feedback and engage on the report. Moreover, factoring in stakeholder engagement time as a deliverable has worked well to ensure ownership at decentralized levels as it is closer to programme implementation level.
"
ESAR,South Sudan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons learned: 
UNICEF continued to have an important role to better link humanitarian-peace building and development investments. South Sudan is experiencing protracted, new, and sudden onset emergency situations. Embryonic systems need to be strengthened to be more resilient and responsive. UNICEF’s engagement in the Partnership for Peace Building, Recovery and Resilience (PfPRR) Programme and its work with the African Development Bank and KOICA are important opportunities to actualize these linkages.  Documenting lessons learnt will be important moving forward. 
 
Advocacy on nexus programming also needs to be louder as short-term partnerships do not provide the needed durable assistance to children affected by emergencies. Case support for a child who has lost parents or suffered a grave violation such as rape, maiming or severe trauma must go beyond a short-term humanitarian intervention as it may take years for the child to feel safe again, thus needing multi-year assistance. Thus, strengthened social work systems and partners are needed to provide case support post emergency. UNICEF also recognizes the limitations in the social protection system, set alongside what has been an ‘in-kind’ driven response. In 2023, UNICEF will invest further in the social protection system and develop a strategy for complementary cash-based humanitarian responses. Building the capacity of local NGOs rather than maintaining large investments in international NGOs is also critical for sustainability. Thus, in order to build this needed sustainability, and work at the nexus between humanitarian and development programming, more investments need to be made with local women- and youth-led organizations, particularly if we are to achieve shifts in behaviours and norms in gender-based violence.   
 
Alignment of programmes is critical for effective results and value for money (VFM). A review of the Global Partnership for Education, AfDB and the European Union grants showed there are several synergies including on location, target populations and interventions. Aligning the funding led to an increase in the number of beneficiaries such as the number of teachers trained and receiving incentives.
 
UNICEF-supported vitamin A supplementation campaigns and wasting treatment sites emerged as two platforms to deliver a package of integrated preventative health, nutrition, and WASH services to children, pregnant women and lactating mothers. To accelerate the reduction of wasting among young children, UNICEF will continue to support a transformative community-based structure to promote preventative nutrition interventions. 
Strengthening governance and leadership capacity of the Ministry of Health and State Ministries of Health was critical to the successful rollout of COVID-19 vaccine deployment.¿ COVAX resources also contributed to system strengthening activities, supportive supervision of COVID-19 vaccination including elements of routine immunization.¿ 
 
UNICEF supported nutrition information generation and management, and will leverage the opportunity provided by information technology to improve the national information system to allow inter-operability with the District Health Information System (DHIS2) platform. Starting in January 2022, UNICEF abandoned parallel reporting systems of health data in support of DHIS2 and this has helped to promote DHIS2 as one data collection, analysis and reporting source for the country.
 
The use of Long-Term Agreements and Engineering Service contracts has improved response-time in both emergencies and regular implementation of programmes. One example was the deployment of a drilling company within 24 hours, to provide a water source for the Ebola Disease Centre near Juba.
 
Innovation:
Inadequate infrastructure in many areas necessitated the adoption of innovative processes to support programmes to reach populations across the country. During 2022, UNICEF made great progress in reducing the reliance on Cash on Hand accounts and shifted to increased use of financial service providers to mitigate inadequacies in the financial sector, especially the lack of a central clearing house and credible banking services at the subnational level. With the evolving mobile money eco-system, UNICEF will benefit in 2023 by being an early adopter of those systems, in terms of cost effective and efficient reach to target populations. 
Technology solutions were provided to the key ministries of Health and Education which entailed the acquisition of internet connectivity for Ministry of Health structures and the deployment of web portals for the Ministry of Education.
UNICEF ensured service continuity despite restricted access by using the narrow window of the dry season to preposition the field supplies required to treat children suffering from wasting, for the entire year. In addition, to improve adequate availability of lifesaving nutrition supply at the point of use and enhance accountability to the affected population, UNICEF introduced a supply maturity model including a strong end-user monitoring module. 
In response to the recurrent cycles of floods, which demand innovative, resilient, and environmentally sensitive infrastructure designs, UNICEF and the Ministry of General Education and Instruction developed climate-resilient designs for classrooms with a raised foundation and school boreholes with a raised platform. The elevation of handpump platforms in the areas prone to flooding has proven to be a successful innovation. Pilots in several states have been well received by the communities, who appreciate the importance of the climate-resilient infrastructure. The community-led total sanitation approach has also been modified to advocate for communities in flood prone areas to build their toilet platforms above the predicted water level. In the education sector, UNICEF also adjusted its cycle of implementation to concentrate construction activities during the dry season to mitigate against inaccessibility of sites during the rainy season. 
 
The innovative intervention of Gender Based Violence (GBV) nutrition integration introduced in 2021 continued into pilot implementation phase in 2022. This intervention builds on growing evidence that nutritional outcomes for mother and child are significantly worse where gender-based violence is present at the household level. In 2021-22 a fully integrated nutrition/GBV programme was piloted focusing on increased referrals between GBV actors and nutrition actors. The findings from the pilot are extremely promising with high disclosure rates on incidents of GBV to female nutrition workers, increased numbers of referrals, stronger awareness of GBV at nutrition sites and improved safety of girls and women. "
ESAR,Uganda,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In 2022, UNICEF Uganda continued to spearhead innovations in its development and humanitarian programming. Digital innovations and digital microplanning tools developed during the COVID-19 response were fully integrated into the routine immunization programme in Uganda to increase vaccination rates. Innovative ways to engage political, religious and community leaders and influencers were key in providing accurate information to counteract vaccine hesitancy and mistrust and critical in the EVD outbreak response.  
  
The boosting of the ‘delivering as one’ approach in joint UN programming demonstrated new ways for co-creation and optimization of delivering of services, including through engagement of community in programming, and was spearhead in the planning and implementation of the Spotlight and teenage pregnancy programmes, while U-Report was actively used to gauge adolescents’ participation and feedback.   
  
UNICEF Uganda, UNESCO and MoES delivered on the education system’s digital agenda by assessing the education system’s e-readiness and using the Kobo data management system in the 29 UNICEF-supported districts to provide viable education data in the absence of EMIS thereby supporting district planning and monitoring. An innovative model of skilling youth for ECD brought together the government, private sector, civil society, and young people to address the twin objectives of engaging youth and providing quality ECD services for young children.  
  
Innovative approaches in child protection leveraged the use of smartphones owned by community development officers and social workers, using harmonized web-based applications and smartphones to collect data and thus mitigate existing challenges with manual recording and transmission of administrative data through case management books. The UCO Information Communication and Technology for Development section successfully launched the second cohort of the UNICEF Innovation Fund challenge, awarding UGX 545 million (US$145,000) to five new innovators, while continuing to support the ongoing work of the three awardees from 2021.  
  
Valuable lessons learned were derived in 2022. The long COVID-19-related school closure underlined the need for innovative and alternative ways of delivering education, including early learning materials. Materials and tools developed during the pandemic were instrumental in ensuring delivery of quality home and community-based learning – even after schools reopened – to vulnerable young children and pregnant girls that could not or could not afford to return to school. The piloting of the new comprehensive life skills toolkit proved that structured life skills education can strengthen adolescents’ core competencies even when implemented as co-curricular school activity.  
  
Implemented programmes underlined the critical role of the established child well-being committees for strengthened district and sub-county child protection action and underlined the fact that districts with strong leadership knowledgeable in child rights and child protection issues are more results oriented and committed to bringing together diverse partners and can ensure better multi-sectoral coordination. The evaluation of the social service workforce in UNICEF-supported districts highlighted the key role of social welfare officers in community-based child protection prevention and response. Districts with a social welfare officer reported supporting higher numbers of reported VAC cases and demonstrated stronger linkages with para-social workers and model parents, bridging the gap between service providers and communities in preventing and responding to VAC.  
  
Lessons learned from Mukono municipality in WASH underlined that ownership and participation across the entire sanitation chain and close collaboration with local authorities is extremely important for the successful implementation of urban sanitation. Furthermore, the private sector proved to be the main driver of sanitation improvements in urban areas, as demonstrated by the Satopan and lined-pit technology innovations, which made toilets washable and safe for children while providing income opportunities for local masons. In addition to providing entrepreneurship and income opportunities for community sanitation value actors (masons and village loan and saving associations) the market-based sanitation approach and urban sanitation demonstrated the potential to leverage government programmes such as the Parish Development Model and the Women Development Fund. The engagement of parents and school management to set up and maintain WASH facilities, including through fund management, is key to continuous and proper functionality of WASH facilities in schools. In addition, the provision of safe water to schools enhanced opportunities for the delivery of diversified and nutritious diets through vegetable gardens.   
 
With the pastoralist nature of the Karamoja region, UNICEF came up with an innovative nutrition integrated community outreaches with multi-disciplinary teams for direct SAM treatment called “Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) that improved adherence to the prescribed dosage of RUTF and contributed to better treatment outcomes reaching, all estimated children with SAM in the region. 
 
Many districts do not have HR for nutrition and this affected resilience of those districts when emergency happens 
  
An important lesson learnt in social policy was that there is need for a robust national contingency planning to anticipate and mitigate the impact of multiple shocks (such as COVID-19, the spillover effects of the Russia-Ukraine war, and the EVD outbreak) on the vulnerable households. In the face of multiple shocks that diminish the fiscal space, UNICEF needs to engage deeply and more regularly in the national budgeting process for impactful results for children. In the area of evidence generation, efforts also need to be coupled with the development of a robust advocacy strategy to influence policy and practice. Engaging at all levels of policy, including with technical-level government colleagues, is critical to get buy-in for system-wide advocacy initiatives. 
  
Social protection coverage remains low, and programming is mainly concentrated at central level with districts largely excluded from social protection programming. Consequently, there is need to improve the understanding of social protection at the sub-national level. Developing shock-responsive social protection systems is critical to facilitate quick scale-up of assistance to households following disasters.  Additionally targeting for social protection remains a huge challenge in Uganda and requires further investments. 
"
ESAR,United Rep. of Tanzania,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"One of the key innovations demonstrating promise in Tanzania has been the roll out of Mama na Mwana. UNICEF strengthened Health Information Systems through the implementation of the digital client feedback mechanism in Mainland and a digital community health information system in Zanzibar, both integrated with DHIS2, the standard platform for health information in Tanzania. 
 
Mama na Mwana enables mothers to provide feedback on the care received during and after pregnancy and childbirth. With the support of Health workers in communities and facilities 20,257 mothers across 4 regions (Mbeya, Kigoma, Dodoma and Dar es Salaam) had registered by the end of 2022. The data generated indicates that up to 50% of mothers report to be denied treatment due to inability to pay and that up to 22% of mothers are not able to discuss their concerns during the first antenatal care (ANC) visit. Use of this data will be promoted across all levels of the health system to improve services, and additional areas of care will be added to the feedback mechanism in 2023. 
 
Another key innovation is the AQTap, a prepaid water dispenser machine that helps to guarantee an uninterrupted supply of water in communities. It has an integrated revenue collection system, enabling water users to top up their tokens at a minimal fee and get access to clean and safe water when needed. By collecting revenue for operation and maintenance, the AQTap is helping to ensure that water supply is sustainable and can continue to be accessed by all members of the community. 
 
Access to the AQTap is available 24 hours a day, and the first phase of installations has seen 27 AQTaps installed in two districts of the Kigoma region, covering a potential 35,608 people. Using AQTaps, communities have reported a reduction in water loss of up to 20%, which has increased sustainability of the water supply and improved access. Water user committees, RUWASA and leaders of community-based water supply organizations (CBWSOs) have reported an increase in revenue collection, compared to other villages that are still using normal water taps. The revenue collected provides water system resilience and minimizes risks associated with money exchange by water management committees. Further to this there is increasing evidence to show that the use of the AQTap has resulted in greater trust in water usage committees, and increased accessibility to clean and safe water for all community members. 
 
Two major lessons learned in 2022:
1.Use of evidence generation to scale up social protection intervention: Children in Tanzania are affected by high levels of stunting (32%) and 3 million children under the age of five experiencing stunting. Leveraging the power of data and analytics for effective policy advocacy, UNICEF developed a uniquely innovative social protection investment case to shed light on the cost of expanding Stawisha Maisha and Ujana Salama Cash Plus through their integration into the national social protection architecture, on the potentially available and required fiscal space, as well as on the social and economic gains to be expected from that expansion. The evidence generated in this pioneering study led to Government’s decision to fully integrate, scale-up and finance Stawisha Maisha in the national PSSN II programme with a view to transform nutrition outcomes by building the capacity of beneficiaries in terms of infant and young children feeding practices.
 
2.Working with PHC Committees to increase community uptake of COVID-19 and routine vaccinations: 2022 saw Tanzania make substantial progress in the uptake of COVID-19 vaccination. A key lesson learned in this success is working with PHC Committees at regional, district, ward, village and street levels increased community uptake of COVID-19 and routine vaccinations. The platform provided an opportunity for politicians, influential people, community, and religious leaders to work together with technical personnel to mobilize the community for vaccination against COVID-19, monitor progress made, and address challenges accordingly. Further to this, the engagement of Community Healthcare Workers or Volunteers (CHW/V) was instrumental in increasing vaccination coverage among vulnerable populations for COVID-19 vaccination. CHWs are able to leveraging community trust and closeness and relatively easy to identify this population, deliver messages and refer them for vaccination services. In the case of Mtwara, CHWs were also able to identify under-five children who had missed their vaccine schedules and reach them with vaccination services through a periodically organized integrated outreach service that had COVID-19 vaccination at the health center.

ESAR,Zambia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF Zambia’s experience in 2022 generated several lessons and innovations, with great potential to apply and accelerate results at scale for the new 2023–2027 country programme.
Lesson Learned #1: It is evident that the road to building back a better health system that is able to function at, or close to, pre-pandemic levels is compounded by recurrent PHEs. Re-building a resilient health system will require multisectoral efforts undertaken simultaneously with humanitarian response. Experiences from the COVID-19 response have taught us valuable lessons. For example, the importance of re-positioning the immunization programme to integrate COVID-19 vaccination and as a platform to strengthen primary health care- thus offering equitable access to high impact health interventions, while building a resilient health system.  The COVID-19 pandemic also demonstrated the underutilization of medical oxygen in the pre-pandemic era, and the need for more investment in the production and delivery of medical oxygen as well as operations and maintenance support for all medical equipment. 
Lesson Learned #2: The complex nature of the SUN-II programme requires effective coordination of stakeholders at various levels and this has remained a critical area of focus for programme implementation. Facilitated discussions in all 17 districts with the involvement of Heads of Departments of line ministries, UN agencies, NGOs, District Nutrition Support Coordinators, and the District Nutrition Coordinating Committees has been a positive lesson in enhancing coordination, timely identification of challenges and response. Sustaining community level nutrition interventions through the NSG model and deliberate selection of volunteers known to communities is yielding positive results. This has enhanced trust amongst community members and led to improved volunteer’ motivation, recognition and reduced volunteer drop-out rates. 
Lesson Learned #3: Elimination of user-fees for secondary and ECE learners has brought significant pressure to the new Government to provide additional learning spaces and quality of learning for those who are encouraged to access education. The Government considers the challenge as an opportunity to commit and invest more in education. Support for a well thought, evidence-based and costed longer-term education master plan is needed to realise the country’s longer-term vision of equitable and quality education.  
Lesson Learned #4: Supporting a comprehensive legislative framework that is in line with international standards in child protection is central to social welfare systems building. The strategic approach that worked for UNICEF Zambia included a combination of a) continued technical support, b) provision of fora for practitioners to provide input, making the legislation more applicable and securing buy-in and c) persistent/ongoing high-level advocacy. Engaging senior management and One UN, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, Parliamentarians and NGOs in advocacy for accelerating the finalisation/adoption of child protection legislation proved worthwhile and led to enactment/launch of several child protection legislation/policies.  
Lesson Learned #5: The innovation to work with UNICEF Zambia’s Youth engagement team resulted in improved WASH activities and outcomes and provided a platform for adolescents to voice their opinions and learn. The organisation of changemaker workshops for adolescent children, including children with disability, in commemoration of Menstrual Hygiene Management Day and World Environment Day and in a refugee settlement, demonstrated inclusiveness and an enhanced way to both highlight key issues and celebrate key WASH days. This innovative WASH Youth engagement was a first for Zambia and has quickly expanded to other sectors that UNICEF supports.  "
ESAR,Zimbabwe,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF’s experience in Zimbabwe in 2022 in implementing the new Country Programme 2022-2026 produced numerous lessons learned that offer great potential to accelerate results, at scale, going forward. 

Cross-sectoral and Integrated Programming 
 
UNICEF has increasingly moved towards a cross-sectoral programming approach to support social services delivery and achieve optimal results for children. Building from the Country Programme (CP) Document 2022-2026 and the work done under the last CP, UNICEF developed specific work plans for cross-cutting issues such as adolescents and young people, disabilities, climate, mental health and psychosocial support and gender, in order to focus and coordinate efforts to achieving results in these areas, as part of the broader rolling work plans. This work has enabled UNICEF to better plan and monitor for results in these areas. 
 
UNICEF has also progressed in implementing convergent and integrated approaches across sectors. The Emergency Social Cash Transfer programme has provided an important platform to scale up results for children across health and nutrition and child protection, using social cash transfers as the entry point, utilizing data collected through the programme to target housholds with information and other referral services. UNICEF utilized integrated outreach services to reach more children and families with services, particularly remote communities, combining health and nutrition services, including Vitamin A Supplementation to extend reach to 1.7 million children. The office has harnessed data from the 2022 Census as well as ZIMVAC 2022 to identify key deprivations at district level which will also inform UNICEF’s approach to enhance convergence and integrated programming in 2023, leveraging also on the devolution and decentralisation agenda of the Government which provides entry points for strengthening collaboration and convergence programming at subnational levels.  
 
Innovative approaches 
 
UNICEF continued to lead innovative approaches to improve programming and data systems in 2022. In the area of technology for development, UNICEF supported the use of Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing during the 2022 National Census, which enabled timely dissemination of key statistics to inform programme planning as the average waiting time for results was reduced from at least three months to one month from Census completion. The supply chain management system in the health sector was strengthened through support for the rolling out of the electronic Logistics Management Information System (eLMIS) to all Health Development Fund (HDF) districts (42), provincial (8) and central (6) hospitals as well as all 59 health facilities in Makoni district. The eLMIS enables health facilities to efficiently manage supply chain management through timely ordering, stock management as well improving LMIS data quality for accurate national forecasting. In education, UNICEF supported the development of 4,152 lessons based on the curriculum, uploaded onto Learning Passport (LP) and more than 15,000 teachers were trained on remote teaching and learning in collaboration with UNESCO while 50 schools received basic Information Technology hardware to promote use of the LP, providing online lessons to 108,934 active users.

Programmatic innovation has also been taken forward in 2022. Implementation of nutrition SMART surveys enabled UNICEF to validate and improve the ZIMVAC methodology for increased reliability of wasting and acute malnutrition prevalence estimates at district levels, providing a better understanding of nutrition situation at sub national levels. The establishment of the young mentor dads (YMDs) approach drawing lessons from successful young mentor mother models was another major milestone to strengthen male engagement in pediatric and Prevention of Mother-to-Child HIV Treatment services, which had been one of the key barriers to women and children’s access to timely diagnosis treatment and care. Further, community engagement in climate resilient WASH services is leading to sustainable solutions. In particular, the UNICEF-supported climate risk insurance schemes for solarized piped water initiatives established by water point committees, wholly funded by communities, will replace or repair high value components of the solar piped water system to reduce the impact of loss in unforeseen circumstances. 

Social analytics and community feedback
 
Social listening and community feedback in the COVID 19 response promoted rapid use of information for informed decision making, responding to evolving needs. COVID-19 social listening enabled identification of community fears, rumours and misinformation contributing to vaccine refusal and hesitancy, thus provided UNICEF and partners with the foundation for reviewing, updating and adapting the national risk communication and community engagement strategy and communication assets. Based on feedback from social listening mechanisms, UNICEF supported the production and dissemination of key facts debunking rumours and providing factual information on vaccine safety how vaccines work; UNICEF also used information to update key messaging and vaccine Frequently Asked Questions - reference documents for community volunteers conducting vaccine demand promotion; and finally UNICEF used multi-media platforms to share life experiences and positive vaccination stories to build vaccine acceptance among hesitant populations.

UNICEF harnessed feedback also from other platforms to inform programming approaches. UNICEF supported the 393 Youth Help Line as platform for adolescents and youth to share their concerns and seek referrals for essential services, receiving an average of 200 calls a day. UNICEF supported Helpline Counsellors - available 24/7 - to listen to issues affecting young people’s mental health and offer counselling and referral services; as a result, 270 cases on mental disorders were referred to therapy sessions. The Helpline has proved to be a confidential and safe platform preferred by adolescents and young people; 86 per cent of calls to the Helpline are from the 10-24 years age group, sharing their concerns and questions on access counselling services. In 2023, UNICEF will scale up social listening through the 393 Youth Help Line to identify, track and respond to issues affecting children, adolescent health and well-being, including drug and substance abuse. 

"
HQ,"Analysis,Planning & Monitoring",Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Building evidence-based decision-making into UNICEF organizational infrastructure  
There is a need to continue accelerating efforts in providing ‘real-time’ data and information for informed decision-making, advocacy and action. When the right data are in the right hands at the right time, decisions can be better informed, more equitable, and more likely to protect children’s rights. Effective use of data can help UNICEF not just plan, track and report results for children, but also shape those results with better insights about what’s working, what’s not, which children are thriving, and which are being left behind. DAPM will need to continue striving towards contributing to the development and implementation of organizational systems for such purpose while also exploring new opportunities for ‘nowcasting’, forecasting and predictive analysis, including by using new techniques and tools (‘frontier data’) such as analysis of social and news media streams, undertake geospatial analysis, and link administrative data systems for more powerful data for children.  

Building on lessons from strengthening analytical work for decision-making, making use of the new Core Standard Indicators (CSIs), DAPM will need to continue investing enhancing the evidence of the results of UNICEF work in the world, including by preparing a first Global Effectiveness Review. DAPM will also continue to support the roll-out and uptake of the new country programme management package with a corresponding systematic feedback mechanism, and will improve system-interoperability and digitization of internal systems as well as vis-à-vis the UN-INFO system to reduce duplicative reporting. Regulatory architecture will be developed and rolled-out on Environment and Social Standards (ESS) to enable the organization to effectively manage corresponding risks, contributing to a strategic internal shift towards more agile and integrated risk management at all levels of the organization. 

Strengthening national data systems  
With stronger national data systems and statistical capacity, governments can better target their investments for more sustainable development outcomes for children and future generations. However, there are many challenges that prevent the availability and use of data for policy formulation, implementation and advocacy. Building on the increased need to connect global work on internationally comparable data with maximizing the use of data at the country level more collaboration is needed with UNICEF regional offices, country offices and partners in the Global South to enhance the availability and use of data for decision-making. By doing so, the division aims at supporting evidence-informed policy advocacy and advice, and help governments make informed decisions that protect the rights of children. 

Strengthening the PMD function as a prerequisite for UNICEF's results  
As the custodian of the Planning, Monitoring and Data (PMD) function, DAPM aims to position UNICEF as a strategic and authoritative advocate for child rights. By enhancing UNICEF’s ability to improve planning and monitoring, in particular the related analytical capability, use data and evidence in advocacy, strategic prioritization and programming, DAPM can better contribute to the progressive achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlined in our Strategic Plan 2022-2025 and beyond. However, in 2022 it was found that there is still a lot of opportunity to strengthen this function, particularly at the country level and therefore additional efforts will be required in the next years. 

Mobilizing data for humanitarian action and establishing data governance systems that are adaptive 
UNICEF's dual mandate to work in both development and humanitarian settings presents a unique opportunity to help countries build flexible data systems across contexts and rely on agile corporate processes, systems and tools. Technical infrastructure can be developed, tested and deployed in the development context with the crisis context in mind alongside data governance policy to ensure responsible use of data in both settings. This means data and systems are in place and used when a crisis hits and are suited to function during sudden-onset emergencies, as well as protracted humanitarian emergencies, where both development and humanitarian challenges are simultaneously occurring.   

Launching the seventh generation of MICS (MICS7) as a cutting-edge household survey programme fit to meet today's challenges  
Building on the success of implementation of MICS in previous years, and with adequate levels of investment, big advances can be expected with the launch the MICS7 programme in 2023, when it will transition to a new business model with increased sustainability, usability and cost ownership of countries. Using the experience of implementation of MICS Plus surveys that demonstrated that timely data can be generated through mobile phone data collection, including for crisis monitoring, and on the knowledge and attitudes of populations on issues related to children’s well-being, also more emphasis will be required on this particular MICS feature. 

Driving resource mobilization, including for emerging priorities 
Many problems pose a challenge in the 21st century including the impact of climate change on children; the impact of public health emergencies on children; data preparedness and data governance for emergencies, including emergency preparedness, among others. This requires more agile and new approaches to programme planning, implementation, monitoring and reporting as already incorporated into the new programming package though continued adjustment and investment in orientation remains required and priorities for the division are increasingly directed to these new areas of work. To enable this work both at the country level and for UNICEF, DAPM will need to continue prioritizing resource mobilization campaigns to strengthen national and global data-driven infrastructure. Resource mobilization has proven challenging, and we will be looking to all-of-HQ support to be successful in 2023. 

Staff well-being and development 
At DAPM, our staff are the cornerstone of all the work, and the division is committed to fostering a positive and supportive working environment. To this end, building on our response to the 2022 Pulse Survey, management will carefully consider the feedback provided by our staff through the 2022 Global Staff Survey and continue to uphold the core principles of the DAPM COMPACT, which include promoting well-being, embracing collaboration, communicating transparently, and leading by example to create a workplace culture that values and supports staff. Additionally, the division is committed to investing in talent management for the PMD function across the organization, providing opportunities for career growth and development.  
"
HQ,Denmark,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Emergency preparedness and response
With business “unusual” becoming the new norm, new ways of working and quick adoption will remain critical to addressing the increased volume, complexity and frequency of emergencies and to ensuring continued resilience. To enable sufficiently fast response to sudden onset emergencies, country offices need to put in place the required preparedness measures including pre-positioning of key supplies and being prepared for rapid decision-making on supplies to be delivered in the first wave – on a ‘no regrets’ basis - including fast re-allocation of country office budgets as needed. Finally, UNICEF must review, define and communicate its global emergency preparedness and response commitment in terms of emergency types, scope, timeliness and financial commitment.  
In coordination with PG, SD published an evidence piece assessing the use of water purification tablets in emergency settings. It assessed the use of chlorine tablets by end-users and primary stakeholders in emergency contexts, the correct use of chlorine tablets by recipients and compared their use with other household water treatment and safe storage technologies and UNICEF’s global chlorine tablet programme. Key recommendations included scaling up distribution and improve targeting, with emphasis on Sudan, Yemen, South Sudan, and Ethiopia, strengthening local supply support, and establishing a standardized, digital pre- and post-distribution monitoring system, among others.
Strategic procurement and delivery
Coordination across teams vastly improved thanks to cross-sectoral efforts, namely for activities related to the COVID-19 pandemic and emergency responses including for Afghanistan and Ukraine. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, cross-center teams were convened, allowing experiences from different teams to be leveraged for strategic and complex negotiations as well as for the delivery of vaccines and therapeutics. With partners, donors and suppliers overlapping, internal cohesion was key to effective and fast responses, consistency and internal capacity building. With the increasing pace, scale and complexities of emergency response, earlier coordination should be explored. 
 
Reliable, timely and relevant data, in a format that supports decision making, provides crucial support to strategic procurement and delivery. 
 
Commitment and action on the sustainability agenda is required, including clarity on target outcomes and dedicated resources to advance the agenda.  
 
Delayed authorization to ship adversely affected planned shipments of packed supplies. To address importation and customs complexities aggravated by lacking internal capacity for process management, country offices preparedness and supply shipping responsiveness must be prioritized.  
 
Market influencing and product innovation
Since the inclusion of assistive technology into its Supply Catalogue, SD continues to play a leading role in ensuring access to assistive products for children with disabilities. To further support advancements in assistive technology, investments in highly specialized skill sets will be required.
In view of stimulating increased demand for new and innovative products for children around the world, it will be important to increase the number of new and innovative products sent to Country and Regional Offices to test and trial. 
It will remain important to clarify our engagement model with the Office of Innovation and to standardize the methods and frameworks for innovation.
In 2022, SD finalized and published its Review of Market Communications to understand the extent to which SD’s communications have been effective in our role to influence markets and highlighted areas, including strategies and tools, where SD could more effectively reach decision-makers in industry and donor institutions.
 
Financing partnerships and solutions
As governments and partners face increasing uncertainty, particularly in regard to public financing, streamlined processes and quotation cycles enable more throughput at lower marginal cost. 
 
Systems strengthening
There has been notable progress in increasing knowledge and supporting the learning needs of supply field staff in SD’s systems strengthening, mainly through the establishment of a new Knowledge Hub, the dissemination of tools, guidance, success stories and the development of AGORA e-courses. As country-level implementation remains a challenge, these investments should be capitalized upon, and efforts should be scaled-up to convert theoretical knowledge into practical skills. Support is needed to further capacitate supply staff on the ground to apply the tools, guidelines and methodologies produced to help them replicate and institutionalize best supply chain strengthening practices (e.g. Madagascar). The planned outposting of select supply chain strengthening positions at regional-level is expected to generate increased buy-in, incentivization and engagements at country-level.
Digitalization of the supply chain
Digital supply chains are critical, not just for countries to deliver better services, but also for SD’s operational excellence and efficiency. Internal communication on Digital Supply Chain Initiatives (DSCI) with the Supply Community further support their implementation and accelerate results.   
Strategic Partnerships 
With the management of major partnerships somewhat diffused across SD, it would be advised to identify lead focal points with clear ownership for each partnership. Increased cohesiveness in the way SD communicates and advocates with existing and potential partners would contribute to improving its positioning in a crowded space.
 
People and culture
Increased automation helps to streamline processes; SD plays an important role in helping the Supply Community better adapt to such changes, therefore particularly attention is needed to ensure staff are prepared and trained to adopt digital tools.
With the high number of recruitments, additional training for hiring managers would benefit recruitment processes and improve retention, particularly on how to conduct interviews and provide constructive feedback, as well as alignment on guidance across human resources teams. 
 
Communications
SD’s communications have further gained space with target audiences on key areas of the Supply Function’s work.  Exploring increased opportunities with PFP.  National Committees and DGCA on targeted messaging on increasing access to essential supplies for children. In addition, SD has demonstrated leadership in data and expertise, which should be increasingly leveraged in strategic communication to support partnership building, including on how sustainability in supplies contributes to improved resilience.
Governance and oversight
Cross-functional collaboration and oversight were paramount to SD in 2022, as they enabled increased understanding of risk areas and facilitated the implementation of mitigating actions.  SD would benefit from clarification on the organisation’s risk appetite, through organizational risk governance mechanisms and leveraging the newly recruited Chief Risk Officer, and particularly as it relates to emergency preparedness and global pandemic preparedness.
 

"
HQ,Div. of Finance & Admin Mgmt,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"DFAM ended 2022 with many achievements in line with our SP 2022-2025.  However, some challenges were encountered, and adjustments will be introduced to enable DFAM to continue on track in achieving its strategic goals. In general, ongoing supply-chain challenges due to COVID-19 and Ukraine Crisis continued to have a negative impact on the timely delivery of planned projects in NYHQ and Field Offices. 
 
In managing the operations function within the hosted funds, 2022 witnessed an increase in Hosted Partnerships fund portfolio and additional requests for tailored solutions by the Partnerships impacting the workload and putting pressure on DFAM Funds Support Office services.  
 
DFAM played an important role in 2022 in generating savings for UNICEF upwards of $200M.  However, the team in Treasury is small and is challenged with many demands. The team has supported large key initiatives and continues to face increased demands in responding to urgent emergency response funding requests; continues to provide guidance and technical support for new innovative financial activities, all of which are constraining the existing resources.  
 
Increase in number of urgent last minute PSFR CO related requests was experienced e.g., setting up new banking relationship, contract with a new PSP to DFAM without clearance/coordination by PFP Geneva.  Additional ways of supporting PSFR offices will be explored, noting that in the last two years FSPs approved by DFAM have doubled the number. 
 
Linked to the above is poor planning from COs Programme teams with relation to their cash needs for programme implementation. This poses a challenge resulting in inaccurate forecasting by CO Finance teams, further impacting DFAM’s ability in formulating accurate projections of liquidity. Also, insufficient visibility on Public Partnerships Division (PPD) incoming cash flows from Other resources funds complicates foreign exchange management which is critical now that USD is so strong and other currencies weak. 
 
Prompt and effective communications with personnel is a key factor in strengthening UNICEF’s ability to continuity business and be resilient when disruptive events happen. However, the degraded support from ICTD for the Everbridge Emergency Notification System, which is a key crisis communications resource, has made it challenging to maintain effective use of the tool and expand usage to other offices interested in using it.  DFAM will work with ICTD to improve the support required. As part of the key activities for 2023, CRU will expand organizational emergency preparedness and resilience practices to include relevant and current topics in the space of Occupational Safety and Health (OSH).
 
In 2022, while 53 per cent of offices are in common premises, DFAM faced challenges in meeting the Common Premises strategic plan targets due to lack of rent-free premises/land from governments.  DFAM will explore possible support from the Executive Office to negotiate release of free land or buildings from Governments.

The Global rollout of eZHACT 2.0 project which started in 2022 will continue through 2023. This is designed to reduce transaction processing time (with up to 80per cent steps reduction in some transactions like change of funding source) and provide additional information on programme spending. It also integrates with other corporate applications like Work planning system and eTools.
 
The Travel Reform Project will continue in 2023 with the objective of promoting travel cost efficiency and savings at all UNICEF locations where travel is initiated; to use technology within the travel industry, move effectively and gain economies of scale; to support the implementation of UNICEF Travel Strategy; to re-allocate specific roles, responsibilities and accountabilities among the key players. 
 
Other key activities that are carrying forward into 2023 include the work in relation to the adoption of the new mandatory and technically complicated Financial Instruments accounting standard for the 2023 financial statement; the expansion of the automated PSB workflow tool to cover all other types of write-offs, automating recording of cases and eliminating the need for paper trails and emails. There have been some delays on the work on this from ICTD side; and as part of 2023 key initiatives, the finalization and signing of hosting agreement (in line with the Internal Audit draft report recommendation) between UNICEF and four hosted partnerships.
 
Key activities that will be launched in 2023 in line with DFAM strategic plan include:
 
1.     Implementation of the recommendations of the Central Services Center (CSC) in New York review activities by Deloitte.
 
2.     Innovative Finance 4 Children (IF4C) - key projects include the management of the World Bank bond preliminary assessment that was requested by the Executive Board, in addition to exploring new financing mechanisms (concessional loans, bridge funds for donor contributions), prefinancing of supplies, the new fundraising through investment managers – policy, SOPs, and review and approval of specific engagements, the CrpytoFund extension and scale up, and risk transfer instruments (insurance).
 
3.     Implementation of the Grants Management Process redesign project integrated with UNISON in order to achieve organizational alignment with fundraising and partnership processes and practices both for public and private sector.
 
4.     Advance Financial closure project (AFC) to modernize UNICEF’s closure activities to free up time at the country, regional, and HQ levels and reduce errors and improve the quality of UNICEF’s financial information. 

5.    Implementation of recommendations from 2022 audit report of UNICEF under Hosted Funds.

1.     Private Sector Fundraising.  Multifaceted role of DFAM Treasury, from review and approval of new counterparties and channels to fundraise and the legal agreements with the counterparty, to simplification of the multi-divisional process to review and approve PSFR counterparties globally, to analysis of the PSFR cash flow management and FX implications.
 
2.     Emergency Response, treasury management expertise for emergencies globally. Expected to cover needs of at least 20 COs. 
 
3.     Global implementation of UNICEF Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Policy.
 
4.     Review and update the UNICEF Internal Control Framework/Policy.
 
5.     Implement a strategic plan to sustain the accomplishments made in managing outstanding audit recommendations from the key oversight bodies according to the year-end targets.
 
6.     Support the continued implementation of UNICEF anti-fraud strategy, especially the fraud Awareness efforts among offices.
 
7.     Prepare for the Midterm Review of the Integrated Budget 2022-2025
 
"
HQ,Division of Human Resources,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The OneHR function is now equipped with a Global HR Delivery Model which follows a people-centric approach using a client-centric model. It includes the whole OneHR community and positions it as a strong and valued partner in UNICEF to deliver results for children, linking HR delivery both to UNICEF Strategic Plan and to our ultimate organizational goal, every child. The OneHR function has also developed a Strategy to deliver on the People and Culture goals of the Strategic Plan, breaking potential silos between headquarters and the field and between different portfolios within the OneHR function. A few lessons can be drawn from this large transformational project, in particular the importance to closely partner with both the Culture and Diversity team (OED) and the Internal Communication and Staff Engagement Team to deliver people and culture objectives. 
 
In addition, the development of the OneHR Strategy 2022-2025 enabled DHR to draw the following lessons, which will also serve as a foundation for the development of a broader UNICEF People Strategy in 2023/2024:
 
•                A stakeholders’ analysis and a robust consultation process will contribute to reaching a common vision for what we aspire for the UNICEF people experience to be.  The process will involve consultation to agree on a common vision that is compelling, yet simple and understandable by all colleagues.  This vision to be sponsored by the GMT and rolled out to all offices and colleagues should not be viewed as an HR product but rather, a UNICEF one. 
•                Storytelling will be utilized as a an efficient engagement mechanism for all colleagues to realize “what is in it for them” as the vision is rolled out.   This will mitigate the risk of the Strategy remaining as a high-level policy document that does not resonate adequately with UNICEF people.
•                The development of the OneHR strategy has proven the need of a dedicated project manager to appropriately coordinate the development of a major strategy.  The UNICEF People Strategy including convening consultations, drafting documents and maintaining momentum among stakeholders along the process will require a high level of dedication for ensuring success.
•                To develop the draft Talent Management Strategy for Leaders in Humanitarian Action, it was important to utilize data insights for a solid evidence-based approach, as well as use a collaborative and participatory process (the participation of at least 50 key informant interviews with staff in emergency Country Offices as well as leaders across UNICEF).
•                The following additional lessons can also be drawn from the increased focus on Humanitarian Preparedness and Response as a dedicated workstream in the Global HR Delivery Model: 
 
-      Further investment in an Information Management System is required to enable data driven decision making in emergencies, enabling Country and Regional offices to access up-to-date, real-time information. 
-      DHR’s mobilization and coordination of 60 UNICEF colleagues at Country, Regional and Headquarters level to participate in the DHR Humanitarian Review Working Groups was viewed as an excellent contribution in raising awareness of the strategic importance of HR in Emergencies actions, and the advancement of DHR-related recommendations. This resulted in breaking of silos and the creation of strategies and related resources that were considered more fit for purpose. 
-      Achievements were possible through a strong and collaborative partnership with EMOPS, who continuously provided technical input and financial backing.
 
·       Whilst a great deal of resources exist for Staff Wellbeing, greater focus is needed for ensuring effective dissemination to reach those who need these resources, in a format and in languages that are readily accessible. Feedback from the Humanitarian Review working groups reiterated the need to strengthen the Deployment Briefing system to ensure that those persons serving in high-threat environments understand how and where to access it and avail of the resource both before and after assignment. These findings were instrumental in strengthening surge onboarding during Humanitarian scale-ups and ensuring better support and experience for deployees.
·       The conceptual shift to Managing Performance requires a change management approach with a communication strategy for accelerating the shift across the organization. 
Finally, the career support programme for staff with disabilities benefited only those with disclosed disabilities. The fear of discrimination, if disability is disclosed, remains a significant challenge and a barrier to equity and inclusion.
"
HQ,Global Communication &Advocacy,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Digital: Large-scale ‘social media swarming’, as happened in the Islamic Republic of Iran and Ukraine, is increasing. As misinformation increases globally, owned platforms, e.g., unicef.org, are preferred for reliable information. UNICEF must continuously invest in editorial, analytics, and platform aspects. Industry-level changes to Twitter, Meta and TikTok, including staff layoffs and emergence of new formats, e.g., Instagram Reels and Metaverse, impacted UNICEF’s partnerships and performance metrics. Whereas vertical video is essential for UNICEF's social media content, the power of YouTube led UNICEF to innovate longer ‘YouTube first’ videos in audience-engaging formats. To increase donations via global channels, GCA collaborated with PFP to overcome some technical complexities. In response to structural changes in the major fundraising partners, e.g., UUSA, testing, measurement and use of non-campaign content are priorities for 2023, including exploring the fundraising tools of Instagram, Meta and other channels. Improving emergency response timing averts delays (e.g., first days of Pakistan floods) and cause surges in donate clicks for major news moments.

Media: As Ukraine dominated global headlines, securing media attention for other emergencies such as the Sahel, the Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen became harder. UNICEF tactically reframed media narratives to link Ukraine media coverage with related challenges such as food security and nutrition. Key messages delivered by spokespeople in broadcast networks increased UNICEF’s mentions by 83 per cent compared to 2021. UNICEF’s Spokesperson conducted over 200 interviews on Ukraine, including dozens with top-tier outlets. As the global media sector continued shrinking, news organizations shifted focus from UNICEF’s main areas of health, education, mental health, and social protection. As an exception, climate reporting recorded growth, prompting UNICEF to frame key messages around related emergencies.

Content Strategy: Content conceptualization, workflows, and production, with dedicated project management capacity are critical success factors. Consulting the Content Team on setting timelines, defining roles and assigning responsibilities allows proactive planning and integration in the developmental stages of products for specific audiences. Collaborating with Innocenti, Office of Research and GCA influenced UNICEF’s research agenda. Multimedia content requests and channel capacity still need to be synchronized and balanced. The studio is catalytic to content creation, but partnership with PFP, especially on COs emergency responses, remains critical.

Internal Communication: Cross-functional collaborations with divisions on strategic ICSE requires time and commitment to build relationships, clarify strategic direction and initiate work plans. The Global ICSE Collaboration Structure yielded positive early shared collaborative accountability in institutionalizing ICSE. Global Townhalls were successfully piloted outside NYHQ with the Supply Division, Copenhagen, and the Burkina Faso Country Office.
 
Advocacy: As the importance of global advocacy priorities grows in high-income countries, GCA collaborated more with PFP and NatComs in Directors’ Advocacy Network meetings, inter-divisional mashups and the Virtual Skills Share platform. To manage the ever-growing demands on humanitarian advocacy, stronger collaboration with EMOPS, PFP, PPD and PG became necessary. High-level political fora, e.g., UNGA, G7 and G20, were effective in communicating and demanding country-level impact to the right audiences. The focus was around accelerating progress in global action on the learning crisis; capitalizing on government commitments around climate and water; pushing for national action in mental health; and driving high-level political commitments on child survival, immunization, and nutrition.

Youth Engagement: Consistent collaboration and early preparation by COs delivered successful World Children’s Day activations. Focusing on strong, celebrity-led signature video assets, with a supporting marketing campaign, increased video metrics by 1,000 per cent compared to 2021. Focusing on discrimination and inclusion helped countries adapt and contextualize messaging for marginalized groups. Interoffice coordination and financial support enabled U-Report's platform to engage young people through modular chatbots on key topics. Opportunities exist to improve the quality and reach of U-Report actions. Co-creating content with Youth Advocates enhances Voices of Youth and elevates young people’s voices.

Brand: To maintain and cultivate a global brand presence in programming, fundraising, humanitarian responses, GCA leverages UNICEF’s global appeal as an organization for children. Brand building is not just a GCA responsibility, but a cross-sectoral function now integrated among staff and stakeholders. Brand Book 4.0 will strengthen staff capacity on brand fundamentals, help expand the Brand Barometer into more markets and support ‘evergreen’ brand campaigns.     

Strategic Partnerships: Normative guidance, knowledge sharing, and capacity-building should be incorporated in headquarters work plans. The GWA team dealt with 80 ambassador-related cases, including risk awareness and crisis management in the Islamic Republic of Iran. GWA briefings for work in emergency contexts deepened their understanding and engagement. GCA and PFP ought to strengthen alignment engaging GWAs while optimizing partnerships in media and entertainment. Co-creating criteria for non-traditional fundraising and partnerships must be prioritized and cultivated across regions. Consequently, UNICEF can seed content ideas and influence storylines to drive advocacy, build public trust, deepen understanding and increase engagement through partnering companies with global reach.
 
Strategic Planning and Global Support: Flexible and adaptive approaches to work planning, prioritization, and resource repurposing were key to GCA’s agile response to the complex and prolonged Ukraine crisis. The project management taskforce analysed issues and proffered solutions as a foundation for the new Project Management Unit. The global support function is key to organizational alignment and will be bolstered by the envisaged Valencia Office. A new Global Communication and Advocacy Strategy will spell out the global vision and the newly launched Planning, Monitoring and Reporting Handbook will strengthen Communication and Advocacy Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation practices. Evaluations of advocacy and internal communication will provide further insights for the upcoming mid-term review.

Leadership and Operational Effectiveness: GCA staff-focused approach to return to office, mixed with flexible working arrangements, enhanced staff well-being while increasing in-person office presence. The HQEI-inspired functions review was conducted by a consultant to ensure objectivity, impartiality, and effectiveness. Monthly monitoring with sections, staff, and the Travel Unit greatly improved travel certification. Change management was managed through task forces with wide-ranging membership to ensure engagement and transparency. GCA’s Staff Support Plan addressed staff needs while providing executive coaching to managers.

HQ,Global Shared Services Centre,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Innovations

The GSSC’s success has always been grounded on keeping high standards of service delivery for the UNICEF family worldwide. To properly address the demand for GSSC services and ensure that all requests are processed in an effective and efficient manner, the Centre has been working to introduce an innovative approach by automating certain processes with enhanced robotics. 
Through automation, the GSSC successfully operationalized several HR-related policy changes (e.g., teleworking outside of duty station, new special leave types, simplified process for vaccine cases). Investing in automation was a key area to continue delivering business process simplification and create efficiencies. The Centre also created a monthly interface of staff pension data to UNJSPF, ensuring timely reconciliations and avoiding yearly filing of returns. 

A process to simplify and centralize international travel across UNICEF has been initiated and piloted in 2022,¿ through a phased approach that will be expanded to other HQ Divisions and to all UNICEF offices during 2023. The Centre also promoted a more strategic use of FIORI app and ServiceNow software to incorporate more day-to-day transactions based on user functions.

To support a culture of continuous improvement, the GSSC organized several rounds of training for its staff on the Lean methodology. The core principles of Lean include reducing waste (eliminating unnecessary steps in the process) and creating wealth (increasing production in an efficient manner). A total of 69 staff received this training in two cohorts during 2022, and after this an online training module on Lean was developed and made available for all interested staff in the organization. 

In September 2022, the GSSC went live with a dedicated LinkedIn Life tab, establishing the Centre’s presence on the most important social media for job seekers globally. This allowed the introduction of our Centre, colleagues and leaders to a global audience. In the future this will help showcasing our goals and achievements, further positioning the Centre as a modern and innovative employer of choice. 

The GSSC continued to invest in business process simplification, and a new Business Innovation and Support Section was created and operationalized within the Centre, to focus on timely delivery of business solutions. Also, internal restructuring of the Service Quality Management team resulted in increased focus on driving efficiency and behavioural change in country offices worldwide.
The GSSC also focused on addressing the impact of low value procurement by devising both a technical and behavioural solution which is quite innovative in its nature through the use of procurement cards.

During the course of the reporting year, the GSSC has established itself as a client-focused, location-dependent operations hub ¿to increase cost effective and efficient services for other offices (e.g., HQ Support, Ukraine transactional hub).

A further innovation that took place in 2022 was the introduction of a bot to generate payroll reports (there are approximately 3,500 of such reports monthly). This amount of work previously required 15 agents to work simultaneously for 4 hours and 7 days per month. By introducing the bot, processing time has been decreased from 7 days to 14 hours and manual errors have also been reduced. 

Lessons learned

As the GSSC was engaged in rolling out the implementation of the policy on the creation of mandatory cost distribution for all staff, a notable challenge was represented by the short-term mentality in the management of Staff Costs across many UNICEF offices, deeply affecting post management and payroll funding. As a lesson learned from this initiative, the Centre is working on a strategic approach to staff cost funding that prioritizes long term commitment of funds to support sustainable programme implementation while maintaining strong staff engagement. This includes emphasizing the inclusion of staff cost during fundraising negotiations, budgeting, staff post creation, system mapping and payroll administration. Also, the GSSC is working to devise a centralized mechanism that will support long-term staff cost funding for emergency countries that, by nature, have short term funds.

HQ,Info & Comm Technology Div,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The increasing use of digital technologies in programming has highlighted the need for stronger governance measures to ensure the effective implementation and management of these tools. As digital technologies become more pervasive, we must ensure that programming initiatives are aligned with our strategic goals, and that we have the necessary structures and processes in place to mitigate risks. Furthermore, the ICTD’s transition to three geographical locations introduced some risks to delivery due to resource attrition and has presented certain challenges in managing teams. With dispersed teams, communication and collaboration can become more difficult, and coordination of efforts may require additional resources and effort. Therefore, effective governance frameworks are essential in ensuring that teams are aligned and working towards common goals, regardless of their physical location. Additionally, clear communication channels should be emphasized, with clearly defined roles and responsibilities, as well as standardized processes.
 
One of the primary learnings from 2022 has been that investments for digital transformation (DX) in specific verticals of the organization alone cannot lead to a digital transformation, nor will simple procurement of the latest technologies. To transform, the organization needs a deeper reset of its approach to delivering results, many of which depend on digital means. In order to do this, UNICEF will require the adoption of digital-by-design practices, digital dexterity and upskilling of staff, an integration of DX in programme planning processes, guidance on engaging governments on child rights related to digital environments and digital systems strengthening, consideration for intersectional and competing rights, public leadership on DX for children, horizon scanning and scenario planning capabilities, and close collaboration on these areas across all areas of business. This complement of cross-cutting DX issues should be addressed as a unified UNICEF and as part of an overarching programme for the entire organization.
 
Regarding UNICEF support to government system strengthening for digital, in areas such as health, social policy, protection, interoperability is increasingly recognized as critical for success. To this end, more cross-sectoral collaboration would be beneficial.
 
ICTD’s timely involvement in digital technology initiatives needs to be emphasized, including in the formulation of clear governance, as well as roles and processes for all involved. Also, while there has been good progress, the diverse maturity levels of service providers continue to hinder rapid scale up. Moreover, enhancement of risk and change management to drive adoption and integration with other core systems has been identified as a key opportunity to be explored. Resource constraints and competing organizational priorities caused delays in project execution and delivery.
 
Additional lessons learnt from across the regions include:
·         There is a need for continued development of staff digital dexterity including through collaboration with staff development committees.
·         Sustainable and institutionalized funding for digital transformation is needed, as unsustainable and risky capacity growth based on short-term funding leads to short-term recruitments and loss of institutional knowledge.
·         Digital transformation is still insufficiently integrated in programme planning and evaluation processes, and there is a need to formally measure impact.
·         Some regions see a high diversity in capacity, requiring varying levels of hands-on support to country offices.
·         Last-mile connectivity and the digital divide between hard-to-reach areas versus the urban areas are still massive challenges in some regions.
·         Involvement of ICT and/or T4D staff from the outset is an important aspect in the success of digitally enabled initiatives and improving results for children.
·         Digital transformation should be supported through investment in staffing, capacity building, and the development of a ""culture"" of digital by design. Bold action is needed to address gaps and leverage programmatic funds, with well-funded digital strategies and plans to bring about change.
·         Developing strategic partnerships and relationships with private sector players for leveraging connectivity, infrastructures, and increasing technical capacity for data analytics and research is also important.
"
HQ,Innocenti-GORaf,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Regular connect, dialogue and discussions with partners helps in managing expectations and builds transparency. The importance of regular dialogue and discussions with regional and country offices and donors helped in managing expectations, particularly related to unavoidable delays and timelines (for e.g., in accessing secondary data, hiring qualified consultants, etc.). Some of the solutions include: (i) setting standard timelines for operations and review/communication procedures, for e.g., a minimum of 4 weeks when agreeing on timelines with regional/country offices.  (ii) More actively engaging partner offices in advisory and review processes (for e.g., as done with the European cost of living study, and Report Card 18, etc.). (iii) Building in risk and mitigation plans into each project, acknowledging the risk of delays in fieldwork such as related to contracting, partnerships and conflict, etc. (iv) Being cautious with rapid response work when the pressure of delivery is high, therefore co-creation of policy recommendations would be important and appropriate administrative procedures need to be in place in order to expedite actions. 
 
Value in convening and bringing partners together. Convening and bringing partners together provides space for leading global discourse, a critical complement to research and publications thus positioning the office as a thought leader. This also creates opportunities for Innocenti research to impact new and strategic global areas of work (partnerships and outputs), for e.g., climate change and gender and new Global Partnership on Gender-Based Online Harassment and Abuse, etc.  Building partnerships both external and internal also helps in expanding networks, reaching out to new audiences, and enhancing technical competencies and expertise, for e.g., partnership with University of Cambridge to support data analysis for Disrupting Harm project.
 
Focus on emerging areas research. Research on emerging areas require strong leadership and support, through secured funds and a strategic vision for growth (including partnerships).
 
Coordination across UNICEF teams and the UN system critical for efficiency in programming. Increased coordination across UNICEF teams and the UN system is important for embedding evidence and learning agendas within policy and programming priority areas, which is critical for building common understanding and efficiency in programming, including resourcing, and for ensuring greater internal clarity around UNICEF Innocenti’s role and resource requirements, etc. Clarity and understanding on responsibilities and mandates across UNICEF teams and UN agencies promotes ownership, efficiency, and better coordination, for e.g., involvement of other UNICEF sectors and thematic areas (gender, child protection, humanitarian) for priority agendas such as ending violence and addressing the rights of migrant and displaced children, etc. 
 
Translating research into actions. The engagement of research teams often stops when the funding ends and the final research report is launched. There is a need for sustained long-term advocacy to increase likelihood of translating research findings into action on the ground. This could be done by working alongside with country/regional offices to learn how to best inform advocacy and programmatic activities with evidence, and what kind of products and tools are most useful for country/regional offices to enable them to support positive change for children.
 
Co-creation with partners and stakeholders instrumental for maximizing research use and impact. Co-creation with Governments and other country stakeholders from the onset and seizing policy moments at country level were instrumental for maximizing research use and impact on policy changes. Featuring in-country partners on social media helped to keep on building trust and increasing research impact.
 
Reliance on donor funding means teams have to primarily focus on project-related activities. Since most of the research is donor funded the priority for the research teams is to meet the project related objectives and activities and with limited staff it often becomes a challenge to respond to increased requests from country, regional offices, and results in overburdening the teams. The solution lies in limiting engagement to an advisory capacity unless there are resource opportunities, for e.g., engaging with country, regional and headquarters divisions only on critical tasks with significant opportunity for impact. 
 
Merger of offices require clear and advance communication.  By far the most important lesson learned in the merger of UNICEF Office of Research-Innocenti and the Office of Global Insight and Policy is the need to communicate clearly and widely in advance to the proposed changes to be implemented. 
"
HQ,Int. Audit & Invest (OIAI),Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In 2022, OIAI implemented a strategy for travel and working modality that allowed for a tailored approach on a case-by-case basis. Options for engaging third-party consultants, guest auditors, coordination with other United Nations investigation services to perform on-site work under remote supervision by OIAI also were considered.
The Office publishes periodic newsletters and cross-cutting reports that are intended to provide a wider audience of UNICEF staff with an overview of common themes distilled from OIAI audit and investigation reports. The redesigned audit report template provides a clearer overview of audit findings and agreed actions
An external quality assessment of the investigations function, completed in January 2022, found that the investigations function was in conformity with the Uniform Principles and Guidelines for Investigations and complied with the OIAI Charter and other UNICEF legislative instruments. The Investigations Section issued two advisory reports to senior management in 2022, highlighting systemic risks and control weaknesses in the areas of recruitment fraud and danger pay allowance that it identified through its ongoing work on assessments and investigations
More than 30 data analytics outputs were developed, providing greater visibility into key risk areas, including cash transfers, supply and logistics, payroll and other financial transactions. Outputs include: a) A dynamic country risk model with a range of risk data attributes allowing the user to individually assign weights and evaluate different risk profiles, and b) Automation of internal audit risk assessments and client survey responses. OIAI also led the creation of an informal oversight data analytics peer network as a forum for knowledge-sharing and learning."
HQ,Off of Global Insight & Policy,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Managing a merger: The merging of OGIP and OoR consumed considerable time and energy throughout the year, creating uncertainty and impacting the morale of many staff.  OGIP leadership acknowledged staff burnout and provided sufficient space and time for colleagues to process organizational challenges.
 
Coping with resource constraints: Resource constraints - particularly for intelligence work that informs UNICEF and shorter deliverables with faster turnaround time and secondary data – proved not amenable to external fundraising. Meaningful engagement with youth or any other partners also took time and resources.  OGIP secured adequate internal allocation for each stream of work and made sure that the team did not spread itself `too thin’ and chose outputs carefully to deliver on a small number which have significant impact.  OGIP also made good use of small-scale funding agreement instead of institutional contracts and developed long term relationship with external partners to reduce the administrative burden related to contracting and build true partnerships when working on knowledge-based products.
 
Building cross-sectoral collaboration: The work on foresight requires collaboration of different work streams as the challenges the world is facing are interconnected: climate, geopolitics, economy, etc. Most of our products are a collaborative effort that include not only the contributions of policy experts but also those of technical teams from within the organization (EMOPS, PG, ICT, Innovation, and other HQ Divisions and regional offices) and external experts. Some of the issues that the team works on have a strong innovation or frontier lens such as the work on digital innovations, climate change, and warfare, driving the discussion about the next generation of issues. We also use innovative approaches to our work such as developing technical working groups and soliciting input into policy products through open and public consultation.  Striking the proper balance between providing products that are interesting and useful to colleagues in the field, while not drifting too far into guidance/programming remained a challenging but important approach.
 
Sustainability and transitioning away from topics: Sustaining attention on any issue area long-term is challenging given the need to keep one eye on the horizon and introduce new topics.  Not all issue areas, however, can be readily handed off to another part of UNICEF without proper consultation and planning.  For some issues, there is a need to review priorities and phase out.
 
Investment in youth engagement: Youth-centered approaches requires capacity and investment which will be critical to sustain and scale this work in ways that are truly meaningful and impactful with, and for, young people and youth partners.
"
HQ,Office of Emergency Prog.,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Underfunded humanitarian emergencies: in 2022 there were many high-profile humanitarian crises, from the war in Ukraine to the severe flooding in Pakistan. The global attention and response to these crises demonstrates what is possible when the international community rallies behind a crisis response. This is in stark contrast with the daily reality for the millions of people who are suffering far from the spotlight. Too many humanitarian emergencies have been neglected due to a lack of media attention, international political will and humanitarian funding. This has led to extremely high levels of humanitarian needs that remain unaddressed. EMOPS will continue to advocate for more financial support to address critical humanitarian needs, including by expanding the donor base and by demonstrating the important role of anticipatory action, cooperation and quality funding. 
 
Climate change is making these crises worse and unleashing new ones. EMOPS support the broader organization to elevate climate action as a priority across the organization in 2022 and accelerate the response to the effects of climate change in humanitarian contexts globally. EMOPS will continue to support children and families experiencing humanitarian crises due to climatic events and build resilience to such shocks in development and humanitarian programming. UNICEF interventions focus on: (1) scaling up climate change adaptation models in its global operations; (2) advocating and engaging in policy development; and (3) prioritizing climate-adaptive anticipatory action and preparedness efforts to ensure timely, effective and cost-efficient actions to save lives and build resilience. 
 
Global food and nutrition crises: the number of children living in food and nutrition insecurity is rising. The combined effects of conflict – including the war in Ukraine – along with climate-induced drought, environmental degradation and the ongoing socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic are pushing already vulnerable children into unprecedented levels of food and nutrition vulnerability. EMOPS will continue to advocate for an accelerated, urgent, integrated and multisectoral response to famine prevention. 
 
Public health emergencies: the frequency and severity of public health emergencies continue to increase, driven by increased population mobility due to globalization, population growth, urbanization, growing human encroachment into natural habitats, climate change and protracted humanitarian crises.
UNICEF is currently building a global strategic plan of action for public health emergencies preparedness and response that is complementary to the work of WHO and supports a reinvigorated global health architecture.
 
Lessons Learned and Way Forward
 
UNICEF role as Cluster Lead (Co-lead) Agency (Clare II)
UNICEF holds a unique role as cluster lead/co-lead for the Nutrition, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) and Education Clusters and the Child Protection Area of Responsibility. In 2023, UNICEF will continue to support the leadership and coordination of humanitarian response, along with national and local stakeholders and in compliance with humanitarian principles. UNICEF’s work will reflect the recommendations of the Humanitarian Review and the CLARE II evaluation on the UNICEF role as cluster lead or co-lead agency of several clusters. Implementation will focus on strengthening, at all levels, UNICEF accountability for its cluster role; prioritizing adequate staffing and funding levels for cluster functions; supporting and maximizing collective impact; and ensuring UNICEF’s experiences and tools as cluster lead agency support effective humanitarian action through the Inter-Agency Standing Committee.
 
Anticipatory action: a key priority in 2023 is increasing UNICEF efforts on anticipatory action, specifically inter-agency collaboration, forecasting, pre-financing and readiness. Skills and knowledge will be strengthened with the required technical expertise to implement key anticipatory action interventions. Because triggers for anticipatory action are based on forecasts, such action is closely linked to using a no-regrets approach to humanitarian response. Anticipatory action gained traction in 2022 within UNICEF and at the inter-agency level and led to improvements in the lives of children and families. But anticipatory action requires anticipatory funding.
 
Programming to strengthen the humanitarian-development-peace nexus: in 2022, EMOPS encouraged requiring country offices to consider humanitarian, development and peacebuilding dimensions when developing new Country Programmes, a direct response to the Formative evaluation of UNICEF work to link humanitarian and development programming (2021). EMOPS also supported the development of the revised UNICEF Procedure on Humanitarian, Development and Peace Nexus and is in the process of developing a Global Peacebuilding Framework, to be launched in 2023.
 
In 2023, EMOPS will continue to empower UNICEF staff and partners in the field to stay and deliver in complex emergencies and to access the most vulnerable children in the hardest-to-reach areas. This is a central commitment of UNICEF. EMOPS will pursue a three-pronged approach: developing and implementing humanitarian policies and guidance on emerging issues; strengthening partnerships to maximize synergies and complementarities; and intensively supporting UNICEF field offices to stay and deliver. 

"
HQ,Office of Global Innovation,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In 2022 our Office business model grounded on establishing frontier partnerships to unlock local and global innovation ecosystems to bring better opportunity for every child, everywhere, began to show the sustainable and scalable impact we envisioned. The combination of collective influence, ideas and investments holds immense promise to close the significant gaps we currently face to achieving the SDGs.
 
As we move forward, we need to continue to expand the diversity of our frontier partnerships and be a broker of expertise across the wide spectrum of global social development stakeholders. This diversity includes grassroots expertise, a shifting development and trade intersection of government partners, a wide smorgasbord of philanthropic, private and public capital markets, as well as an expanding array of digital, tech and design corporations and industries.
 
And as we broker connections and bring in new partners, our mission of equity and opportunity for every child must continue to be central to our priorities and actions. Moving into 2023 our Learning Innovation hub is working alongside 5 countries to be learning pioneers in being early adopters to test and learn what works and doesn’t work in ed tech solutions on a pathway to scale.
 
In 2022 we welcomed the launch of the Adolescent Girls Programme Strategy (2022-25) and see this as an emerging opportunity for us to continue to expand and shape bold and adventurous innovations such as the Digital Literacy Equity Outcomes Fund. 
 
Equipped with the right skills and opportunities, the 600 million adolescent girls in the world today can become the largest generation of female entrepreneurs, leaders and changemakers in history. 48 per cent of video game players are girls, yet only 24 per cent of those working in the gaming industry are women. In 2023 we are teaming up with the gaming industry to equip a generation of girls to become the coders, designers and leaders of a more inclusive, diverse and safer digital future. 
Ensuring today’s youth generation is at the forefront of designing and building an accessible, equitable and human-centered digital ecosystem is an opportunity we will continue to prioritize in 2023.The status quo is unmanageable if we are to reach the SDG ambition. 
We are on the cusp of a period of immense opportunity.  We see it in breakthroughs in climate science and the growing demand for more sustainable societies.  And we see it in the incredible ingenuity, ambition and commitment of the world’s young people.
Tying these reasons for optimism together is technology and digitalization.  We are amid a powerful, global, digital transformation.  One that is — in turn — transforming our communities and our economies.
Together, with our youth architects- as entrepreneurs, employers and employees of the future- we can boldly deliver a blueprint of SDG solutions. 
The Global Digital Compact (GDC) aims to generate a 360-degree look at the digital world today, and a roadmap to better organize ourselves to build a digital future that is open, inclusive, and secure. This includes a lens on the digital technologies of the future with all their implications, not only identifying the great opportunities they present, but also considering challenges and risks they may pose to human rights, fundamental freedoms, and human agency. The GDC will enable a diverse international community across development and trade industries to coalesce around a common goal to ensure our digital future is accessible and equitable.

Critical components of an equitable digital future include Digital Public Goods (DPGs) and Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI). Together, DPGs and DPIs engage a wide public and private partner ecosystem with shared interest to form a digital ecosystem of solutions and platforms built on principles of collaboration, coordination, and equity.
 
An equitable digital future needs tomorrow’s voices, today. Our Office is aligning with the UN Youth Envoy’s Office to actively find multiple pathways and moments to bring young tech entrepreneurs, activists, and citizens into the GDC shaping, especially brokering the intergenerational conversations that are key.
 
As the global community aligns to shape a Global Digital Compact (GDC)- under the coordination leadership of the Governments of the Republic of Rwanda and Sweden- that ensures our digital future is accessible and equitable, we must facilitate collaborations, and lead to bring all voices and valuable contributions together. This includes a lens on the promise of youth-led and localized digital solutions to unlock SDG outcomes. 
 
With ongoing efforts to stimulate a culture of innovation, UNICEF must be intuitively agile to evolve as an organisation appropriately connected to innovative ecosystems in the markets and sectors in which we operate. This inclination to iterate, co-create and scale would mitigate against reinventing the wheel and accelerate transformational change by capitalizing on existing knowledge and insights. With further development existing tools like INVENT, when embedded within relevant operating functions and workflows can become components of investment mechanisms to maximise donor engagement. 
 
We need dedicated focus on refining innovation governance across the organization. Refining how innovation priorities are identified and governed at global, regional and country level. We should set goals to implant the notion of innovation as a discipline at the heart of CPD programmes. This should come with clear priority valves for investment in innovation in areas and sectors where an urgent step change in progress, and exacting demands on the demonstrated impact of the tested solutions. 
 
Addressing skill gaps globally is a shared interest not only in the entrepreneurship ecosystem, but the talent gaps faced by many leading industries reliant on global trade- including technology and gaming. 
Our Office looks forward to facilitating a tipping point of shared commitment to mobilize an even wider coalition committed to equipping today’s digital-native youth generation with the skills and opportunities to become a growing pipeline of entrepreneurs and employees designing and delivering our open, inclusive, and secure digital future.

"
HQ,Public Partnerships Division,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Similar to previous years, the major challenge for the Division in 2022 was the increasingly uncertain global economic outlook, and demanding fundraising environment, with more conditionalities from donors, as well as greater number and complexity of risks to manage. In response to the declining ratio of RR to OR, PPD’s ability to further diversify the donor base and increase the volume of RR funding from public sector partners remains challenging. 
 
The highly earmarked nature of funding continues to also impact funding for emergencies. While UNICEF achieved record-high funding for emergencies in 2022, challenges remain in meeting the increasing global humanitarian needs, particularly with funding restricted to a few large-scale emergencies, leaving many other crises significantly underfunded.  This uneven funding of humanitarian crises is exacerbated by the key challenge of declining core funds. It is RR that allows the organization to rapidly respond and scale-up at the onset of a crisis.
 
While income growth has been record-breaking for UNICEF (including from the public sector) over the last four years, this has not been matched with commensurate capacity within PPD, with the Division having to continue to do more with the same human and financial resources. To sustain this level of results, particularly in a difficult fundraising environment, maintaining and growing UNICEF’s level of resources requires a significantly greater investment of staff time and effort across the organization, including PPD – and ultimately, a greater financial investment by UNICEF – than it did prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. While continuously advocating for investment in the Division, PPD also needs to improve on managing expectations within the organization, including being clearer on what the Division can deliver and what will need to be de-prioritized. 
 
For public sector income in 2023 and beyond, UNICEF as a whole, and PPD in particular, will need to continue innovating beyond existing funding streams, which are currently mainly bilateral grants. The bulk of UNICEF’s funding will remain traditional government contributions, especially for public sector RR – and as highlighted above, these partnerships require deliberate and considerable effort to protect, sustain, and grow current income levels. In line with the new Global Resource Mobilization strategy, jointly with PFP, PPD will strive to coordinate across the organization and to accelerate RR beyond the Strategic Plan financial estimates forecast towards the Funding Compact commitment of 30 per cent of total contributions and further tap into the potential of IFIs, the EU and GPPs. 
 
In terms of influence, PPD will seize the momentum of key achievements from 2022, of growing appetite and receptivity from the public sector thanks to advocacy work built-up throughout the years, to push further the integration of child rights in policies, programmes and resource allocations in 2023. One promising avenue for influencing will be the strengthening of UNICEF’s relationship with parliamentarians around the world.  The Division will build on the improved collaboration and synergies found with other UNICEF Divisions and offices, particularly PFP and the National Committees, to move forward as one united voice for children. 

"
HQ,Switzerland,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"PFP anchors its work around the ‘Income + Influence = Impact’ narrative for the new UNICEF Strategic Plan, 2022-2025, specifically linked to the change strategy on ‘Partnerships and Engagement: Public and Private’. This equation for results has spread across the UNICEF ecosystem. 
 
Income
Funding from the private sector surpassed expected levels in 2022 which was driven by the response to the Ukraine emergency. National Committees and country offices delivered outstanding revenue in 2022, tapping deeper into their market potential and aided by optimized market-level strategies, investment, and fundraising innovation.
 
In 2022, within total private sector revenue, RR revenue decreased by 5.6 per cent compared to 2021. The decrease in RR contributions is predominantly due to significant strengthening of USD against major fundraising currencies like EUR, JPY, GBP, SEK, and KRW. However, revenue in local currencies continued to grow, which indicates that the fundamental business model and strategy are fit for purpose. 
 
Diversification of funding from the private sector will continue to be a high priority, especially for RR. Lessons from the Ukraine fundraising appeal showed that investments in digital and storytelling are hugely important for UNICEF to maximize opportunities. Similarly, investing in journeys for all donors is a pathway to relationship building and to driving long-term value, especially as individual giving is also the largest funding stream to RR.
 
Influence
UNICEF’s advocacy partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation was instrumental in driving donor commitments for multiple global health replenishments and initiatives, resulting in investments in Gavi, COVAX and ACT-A, and amplifying key messages and national requests for new commitments. The partnership also secured extensive national policy changes to turn commitments into improved access to vaccines and child health services.
 
Given the lessons learned of the value and importance of linking key global events to Advocacy with Business (AwB) and business engagement strategies to mobilize income and influence, PFP established an Events Intelligence function. This work takes a forward-looking perspective on key events throughout the year to identify key moments to strategically position priorities and strategies and use the visibility and reach of the events to advance partnerships and engagement. Building and using events anchored in the AwB strategies helps to mobilize a wider group of stakeholders, with events creating urgency and action among stakeholders and catalysing action when planned and pursued strategically. The combination of AwB and engagement strategies with key moments and events creates a journey for partner engagement as milestones for long-term engagement.

HQ,UNICEF Office to AU/UNECA,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The COVID-19 restrictions enforced by the AUC for the first six months of the year imposed virtual working conditions and limited travel, which constrained the smooth implementation of many activities by restricting our access to key audiences, especially young people who expressed online engagement fatigue.  Resources should be made available to progressively transit from virtual to physical meetings in 2023   
 
Limited human resource capacities within the AUC remains a major challenge constraining the AUC leadership in the implementation of many programmes across all areas of cooperation with UNICEF. This is the main reason for the observed lack of AUC responsiveness to many requests, which contributed to the lack of progress in some programs. Institutional capacity should constitute a major component of our engagement with the AU Commission and its other agencies.
 
The office's technical capacity is too limited to deliver UNICEF’s engagement across all eight equalizers effectively. This year, the office operated with only three technical staff and young professionals on a one-year contract under the AU Youth Volunteer program. There is a need to provide UNICEF AUO with more technical human resource capacities for effective and timely day-to-day engagement with AU Institutions.
 
The operationalization of the UNICEF-Africa CDC partnership and the acceleration of the implementation of the Spotlight Africa Regional Programme has increased the office's demands for timely logistical and operational support services. This situation has consequently increased pressure on UNICEF ECO for timely HR and operational support to UNICEF AUO. Acknowledging that UNICEF ECO is already overwhelmed with the Country Office programme support needs, it may be necessary to consider directly strengthening UNICEF AUO’s capacity to undertake additional operation and administrative functions and thereby lessen the burden on ECO
"
LACR,Argentina,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The effects of Argentina's complex economic situation on children (high and persistent levels of child poverty and persistent food insecurity, among others) made it necessary for the Country Office to implement a well-coordinated, simultaneous and mutually reinforcing two-prongs strategy. On one hand, to boost alliances with the government at the provincial and municipal levels and with non-governmental and grassroots organizations to expand UNICEF's capacity to reach the most vulnerable children, particularly those living in slums and in isolated and excluded areas. From this year’s experience, the office learned the urgent need to further expand UNICEF's collaboration with other community organizations, to diversify alliances and promote more territorial work. On the other, to continue implementing ambitious evidence-based advocacy work on public finance for children, social protection and child poverty to inform the public debate and advocate with key stakeholder to influence public-policies. In particular, the action implemented to revert a significant cutback on the budget directed to children for 2023 showed, as in many other situations in previous years, that the CO has a significant potential to achieve results for children based on the generation on robust data to inform and influence public policy decisions.

Also, the complex economic situation generated the need to innovate to achieve planned resource mobilisation targets. For instance, the CO diversified its prospecting channels, implemented new retention activities to reduce attrition, and strengthened its digital channels. Additionally, an ‘automatic opt-in upgrade model’ was tested in telemarketing, face to face and digital campaigns, obtaining a 40% acceptance rate. 

The context implied operational challenges too, especially in procurement and finance. To protect reserves and control inflation, the government imposed various measures, from capital controls to import restrictions on non-essential goods and regulated prices. Additionally, many companies required their clients to make prompt, advance or progressive payments. This situation demanded innovative solutions backed by well-crafted risk management, for instance the introduction of specific risk control measures such as checking vendors’ records and credit ratings for those below the Supply Division verification threshold, having smaller and more periodic deliverables requiring more minor advances or progress payments, and more regular and stringent verification of progress and quality of partial and final deliverables prior to payments.

The Real Time Assessment of UNICEF’s Response in the Gran Chaco region highlighted the importance of UNICEF’s territorial work, such as the MUNA initiative or early childhood working tables, to address unequal access to social services. An integrated, intersectoral approach that considers the socio-cultural context of local communities and reinforces local organization capacity for implementation is critical. Having disaggregated data at local level about vulnerabilities is necessary for effective response. The evaluation recommended ACO to broaden its local-level partners, especially those which can promote the fulfilment of violated rights the government has difficulties to reinstate. Moreover, it proposed to prioritize the Gran Chaco area in program planning, work more on climate change and access to water and sanitation, and incorporate the intercultural lens in education programs. 

Evidence-based consensus, trust and passion were the main requirements to build commitment and mobilize different audiences for the cause of children. It did not matter if UNICEF was working with celebrities, journalists, the private sector or decision makers; they all agreed that children’s rights are a top priority and genuinely believe in UNICEF as the organization to lead the change towards a better world for them. As an example, in 2022 the CO focused on its celebrity strategy to create content based on their own experiences; this strategy amplified UNICEF’s reach and impact. 

The fact that 2023 will be an election year may threaten national and local government commitment to maintaining critical policies. It also implies risks and challenges regarding public exposure and unintended political utilization of UNICEF’s brand and views. However, it also offers an opportunity, if well managed, to keep children’s rights at the centre of the public debate.


"
LACR,Barbados,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The year was characterized by challenges and lessons learned, presenting opportunities from which UNICEF will shape future programme implementation of the new Multi-Country Programme. 
 
Innovative solutions using Real-Time data for evidence-based decision-making 
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of real-time information and data for evidence-based decision-making. UNICEF has increased investment in systems-strengthening and capacity-building for sustainable solutions, with a focus on technology to strengthen nationally owned systems. For example, UNICEF provided technical assistance to the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Ministry of National Mobilization to use Rapid-Pro to do cash payment verifications for affected households following the 2021 volcanic eruption. The tool was used to confirm both receipt of cash payments as well as the amount, and allowed timely corrective actions and follow-up by the Ministry. It provides a practical and sustainable solution to improve results for vulnerable families. Currently, Rapid-Pro is being implemented by the Ministry to do the cash verification process for 4,500 households receiving cash, funded by the World Bank. An online questionnaire on MHPSS was also developed and shared with several national stakeholders to gain a sense of the actual services provided, while continuing to expand service delivery solutions for adolescents through U-Report and MyChild Helpline mobile applications. 
 
Promotion of innovations to strengthen efficiencies 
UNICEF promoted innovation using digital public goods (DPGs) for the continuation of education, social protection and child protection services to strengthen efficiencies. In social protection, HOPE was rolled out in Antigua and Barbuda and Trinidad and Tobago. The management information system covers all aspects of cash programme implementation: registration, targeting, payments, monitoring and evaluation. This strategy, which provided UNICEF with data directly from beneficiaries related to the receipt of cash transfers and the value received, was employed by partners (Red Cross in Trinidad and Tobago and the Ministry of Social Development in Antigua and Barbuda). In Antigua and Barbuda, HOPE was used to successfully distribute US$238,174 to 389 vulnerable households affected by the impacts of COVID-19 through the national social protection system. This grant reached over 1,200 individuals, including 112 people with disabilities, 368 elderly persons and 380 children. Findings from an After-Action Review combined with the deployment of HOPE as a temporary solution are helping to improve regular social assistance, including the development of a national management information system. 
 
Access to child protection services was likewise improved through DPGs. UNICEF ECA began the rollout- of the MyChild Helpline app in four countries, benefiting 498 families with access to direct counselling and child protection services. The app is an agile, scalable and customizable solution which provides children and families with access to MHPSS, an array of child-friendly resources and emergency services. The Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court also launched a new and modern way of doing business with the family court through the implementation of an e-litigation portal for family court matters, allowing for more effective and efficient management of cases. 
 
Stronger coordination, joint and integrated approaches to programming at country level 
A key shift in programme implementation was related to the placement of UN Volunteer National Coordinators in 6 priority countries (Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines), expanding UNICEF’s in-country presence to 8 of the 12 countries and territories. This has resulted in strengthened positive relationships with ministries and partners, as well as support for timely information exchange and response. The development of country-specific results and indicators sets the foundation that the Multi-Country Programme will need to shift to focus more on integrated approaches and concentrate on depth rather than breadth to accelerate results. Thus, stronger programme integration at the national level is needed to accelerate results. This will require sharpening the focus of interventions in each country and/or territory. Moving forward, UNICEF ECA will also put greater focus on integrated systems-strengthening and capacity-building. Key entry points for integration identified include Cash Plus Care, early childhood development and education, and child/youth engagement and participation. UNICEF will also strategize how to further strengthen the capacity of subregional entities, including CDEMA, to have more scalable and sustainable impacts. Key lessons from the joint evaluation on enhancing and accelerating SDGs in the Caribbean emphasized coordination and interaction among partnering UN organisations with government and regional partners and establishing realistic timelines for programming particularly in complex contexts and with the varying levels of capacity among government partners.
"
LACR,Belize,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"As 2022 marked the first year of the Country Programme, the CO identified key lessons to inform programme implementation, enhance results for children, ensure continued efficiency in programme delivery and foster staff well-being. 

Important investment in evidence generation in partnership with the government and CSOs has been invaluable in addressing assumptions and knowledge gaps, and refining programme strategies for the second year of the Country Programme. Key among these has been the need for strengthened integration of gender and disability considerations throughout the programme cycle, from initial assessments through programme implementation, monitoring and reporting. 
 
Additionally, engagement with non-traditional partners, such as the Ministry of Finance, is  critical to achieving the programme results aimed at increasing investment for children and improving the efficiency of public spending. 

Of note was the added value of facilitating civic engagement between policymakers and key constituents, including women, adolescents and faith-based partners, as part of the development and peacebuilding continuum. Dialogue with faith leaders, the government, CSOs and United Nations agencies on the root causes of family violence, and consultations with the Women’s Parliamentary Caucus created opportunities for alliance-building and joint advocacy on violence against children and women, including reform of domestic violence legislation, ending corporal punishment in all its forms and increasing the age of criminal responsibility from 12 to 14 years.  

Furthermore, in line with the principle of Accountability to Affected Populations of UNICEF’s Core Commitments for Children in Humanitarian Action, investment in engagement with communities from the design phase of interventions, with built-in feedback mechanisms to foster programme relevance and local ownership, was critical to ensure buy-in from and build trust with communities in the roll-out of the humanitarian cash transfer programme. 

A key partnership is with the YWCA as a champion institution for gender-transformative education. For decades, the YWCA has been working to empower women, especially in the traditional roles of sewing, embroidery and cooking, among others. UNICEF supported the YWCA to organize non-traditional courses, such as public service driving and barbering for women, giving them an opportunity to demonstrate their capabilities to tackle gender stereotypes, raise awareness about women’s empowerment and encourage gender-transformative programmes. The first 16 women have graduated from the first level, with licences provided by the MYST. The programme will be expanded in 2023.
 
Innovation
In a COVID-19 recovery context, digitalization has become even more integral to UNICEF’s delivery of results for children, as the technology offers new, adaptable and agile ways of investing in human development and humanitarian actions. Hence, there have been considerable innovative approaches integrated into programme implementation in 2022. Highlights include innovative data collection for immunization through the mobile Commcare app, an open-source platform to build Android-based mobile applications for low-resource settings. The mobile application is expected to strengthen the MoHW’s case management system for tracking beneficiaries through the provision of services across the life cycle while simultaneously streamlining data collection and reporting. Institutionalizing CommCare increases front-line workers’ accuracy in reporting, tracking and supporting the registration, follow-up and delivery of services for clients in their communities. Although Commcare has already been deployed in a number of countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Haiti, Peru, Colombia and Brazil), it was piloted in Belize in 2022 and will be rolled out through a phased approach.

Additionally, the CO worked with the Government of Belize to increase access to the internet and digital learning in schools. The preparatory work was time-consuming but impactful, resulting in complete buy-in from the government and collaboration, which are necessary for sustainability. The key steps for connecting all primary and secondary schools nationwide were agreed in collaboration with the MoECST and GIGA. This includes mapping the connectivity of schools in disadvantaged communities, with proposals for contributions of technological devices from the private sector; national curriculum reform, incorporating and developing digital skills; and identifying scalable digital learning solutions focused on enhanced teaching and learning for teachers, facilitators and learners themselves to effectively use the devices for learning.

As part of the cold chain systems-strengthening, UNICEF supported the MoHW in the training of quality improvement officers using innovative approaches to ensure sustainability. Instead of traditional classroom training, the CO carried out daily hands-on training to enable health-care workers to continue providing services to children and mothers as they improve their skills on-site. Quality improvement for maternal, neonatal and child health is new to primary health-care facilities and administration; therefore, this project required a lot of coordination between the clinical and administrative teams to understand the areas needing support for both in the short and long term and to ensure training modules are adapted to match each community. 

The introduction of an innovative payment mechanism for cash-based support for children in Belize benefited from knowledge-sharing with other countries in the region and receiving extensive support from UNICEF headquarters and regional office colleagues. Engagement with a private sector company as a financial service provider requires solid due diligence processes and legal clearances, which presented an opportunity for a good learning experience for both the programme and operations teams. 
"
LACR,Bolivia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The communication and social behaviour change strategies continue to prove  effective for enhancing programmatic results. The use of technology, social  networks and digital platforms made it possible to disseminate messages for  the prevention of violence and teenage pregnancy, the construction of new  masculinities and the promotion of early learning and stimulation, among  others. Partners at the community level played an essential role in these  strategies, while the participation of Indigenous adolescent leaders trained  as ‘community reporters’ helped to continue strengthening these positive  actions to ensure the fulfilment of the rights of Bolivian children and  adolescents. These actions, combining key messages and community  participation, incorporating the socio-cultural beliefs and perceptions of  the population, were disseminated through social networks and local radio  stations.

The generation of evidence through the U-Report platform allowed new  partnerships and joint work with diverse state institutions, United Nations  agencies and social organizations to amplify the voice of adolescents on  different issues. U-Report is a robust participation and advocacy tool,  mobilizing over 7,000 adolescent and youth reporters on issues such as  disability, mental health, access to technology, education and health. It was  a strong mechanism for consultation and dialogue with children and  adolescents, including migrants, that continues to inform programmatic  decisions and advocacy activities. 

COVID-19 and economic, social and political challenges continue to challenge  programme implementation. In this context, distance learning and self-paced  training for capacity-building of frontline workers remained an asset in 2022  for all programme areas, allowing UNICEF to reach more participants from  isolated rural areas, increase the number of training sessions available, and  adapt learning options to the needs of the audience based on evaluation  activities and satisfaction surveys. The real-time  assessment of UNICEF’s response in the Gran Chaco also highlighted the  cost-effectiveness of switching to a virtual modality for continued education  during the pandemic.

Despite challenges in managing and utilizing statistical information  to inform social programmes, UNICEF drove progress and created opportunities  to generate relevant and useful information and data. For example, to improve  the quality of education within the Bolivian education system, UNICEF  supported the Plurinational Observatory for Educational Quality to develop a  diagnostic evaluation of primary education in 2021, which highlights the  importance of quality education in the national ‘Education First’ sectoral  plan that aligns with the priorities established in the PDES, and an education  monitoring and tracking system that will contribute to the decision-making  process of education authorities and guarantee that policy decisions are  based on evidence. Also, to assess and highlight the social impact of  COVID-19 on children, UNICEF supported a multidimensional child poverty  estimation study in partnership with the ARU Foundation. The methodology and  results were revised by the Unit for Analysis of Social and Economic Policies  and the Ministry of Development Planning, and it was agreed to combine efforts  to enhance the methodology for official estimations.

  Multi-level coordination was important to scale up and expand local  interventions throughout the different programme areas. For example, UNICEF  supported the MoE in the development of the ‘Learning as a Family’ Programme;  however, long-term implementation of the programme was coordinated with  departmental and district education directorates. This made it easier for  teachers to participate in the training processes and plan these training  sessions with families, as they received strong support and motivation from the  authorities.

Sharing the progress and results of UNICEF interventions continued to  garner interest and grow support among donors and the private and public  sectors. For example, the results of the Resilient Schools Model, an  initiative that provides practical and local solutions to reduce the impact  of climate change in schools and communities, were highlighted in the  real-time assessment of the UNICEF response in the Gran Chaco. This generated  significant interest among donors, who increased their support to the initiative,  ensuring its future scale-up and expanded coverage. It is important to  accurately continue systematizing and assessing challenges, progress and  results related to this strategy to continue increasing support for  scalability in collaboration with the MoE. 

Collaborations and partnerships remained key enablers of the CP. The  CO implemented a solid Business for Results strategy, focusing on FFWP and  consolidating important partnerships with chambers of commerce, allowing the  CO to leverage programmatic results. For example, UNICEF innovatively  incorporated the issue of well-being and mental health care in the workplace  and was the first UNICEF CO in the region to develop and test a methodology  to work with the private sector on this issue. Moreover, a digital platform  was created with tools for the business sector, with 38 businesses committing  to using it to increase employees’ knowledge of family-friendly practices,  benefiting 1,168 families. This valuable synergy was not common in Bolivia.  As a result of the partnership between the chambers of commerce and UNICEF,  17 companies participated in the pilot programme and were recognized for  their commitment to continue implementing this initiative.

Though seeking the Edge green building certification, UNICEF Bolivia also  aimed to become an example of an eco-efficient office in the United Nations  System and among other organizations in Bolivia. Carrying out the certification  process reflected the CO’s significant efforts and will serve as motivation  for other United Nations agencies and private sector companies collaborating  with UNICEF.

"
LACR,Brazil,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Evidence-based advocacy activities positioned UNICEF as a relevant source of reliable data to raise awareness of the challenges in guaranteeing the right to education with the publication of two studies: Pesquisa UNDIME Educaçao na Pandemia – 8a onda and Desigualdades na garantia do direito à pré-escola. UNICEF also presented its Multidimensional Child Poverty Index methodology at the eighth conference of the International Society for Child Indicators while the Brazil Data Panorama was developed and added to the UNICEF Data Warehouse using Dash technology.

UNICEF actively positioned the rights of children and adolescents in climate action and the environment. The first study on the impact of climate change on children in Brazil was presented alongside COP27, complemented by active engagement of adolescents and youth from Indigenous communities, communities of African descent and traditional communities, who developed a youth Declaration. UNICEF facilitated participation of three young Brazilians in COP27, who showcased their stories and participated via TV and media channels.
Youth empowerment and participation continues to be a driver of policy changes at local level. In the Amazon territory more than 50,000 adolescents and youth participated on key topics of child protection, menstrual dignity, skills development and others. Some important results included the free distribution of feminine sanitary pads by the Government of Maranhão in the public education system as a result of a comprehensive initiative led by youth to raise awareness on racism and gender-based violence.

To address the systematic decrease of immunization coverage and in response to the high number of zero dose children, UNICEF developed the BAV (Active Vaccine Search). The strategy builds on the successfulSchool Active Search, providing a digital platform with automated alerts to identify and reach zero-dose or undervaccinated children and establishing referral systems across health, education and social assistance services to monitor and track vaccination of young children. The BAV platform was launched, developed and piloted in four Brazilian municipalities ahead of roll-out in the Amazon and Semiarid regions in 2023. Complementing this platform, a partnership with Meta and Yale University and direct engagement with youth in urban neighbourhoods and Indigenous communities allowed testing of social media messages to promote vaccinations. The results will be used to support the incoming government in strengthening routine immunization.

UNICEF support to local and state institutions was a fundamental. The response to the migration is not an issue of capacity of institutions, but rather a matter of establishing a principled and rights - based response. While UNICEF and partners have made progress and are committed to AAP, challenges remain to establish beneficiary participation. The participatory mechanisms put in place with indigenous communities are a source of learning. 

The ICT unit continued to provide support to digitally enabled proramme activities (T4D), including providing cost-efficient options for Vaccine Active Search and School Active Search as well as maintenance of the UNICEF survey tool for WASH and education teams and support for the Virtual Learning Environment tool.

UNICEF engagement at municipal level via the Seal initiative was sustained by the online learning platform (AVA UNICEF) to deliver training and technical support to municipal stakeholders across different sectors. Using the platform, 36 courses are being offered to over 2,000 municipal stakeholders, with over 63,000 professionals enrolled. The learning platform is being complemented with a municipal data dashboard providing real-time data to municipal managers enrolled in the Municipal Seal initiative to track progress on child-focused SDGs.
Connectivity remains a major barrier to digital inclusion and access to public goods benefiting children and adolescents, particularly in schools. To address this issue, UNICEF expanded its work on digital learning, bringing expertise from the Giga team – a UNICEF and ITU collaboration – to support the Ministry of Communication and the Ministry of Education in designing cost-effective solutions to connect schools.

The trilateral SSC cooperation programme featured a multi-country learning journey about WASH hosted by the Government of Brazil with eight African countries. The mission reviewed best practices on local management of WASH services and was jointly organized with the UNICEF Regional Office for East and Southern Africa and the Brazilian Cooperation Agency (ABC), with the participation of technical stakeholders at national and subnational levels.

UNICEF Brazil pioneered simplified programming guidance, contributing to user-centred guidance for country offices in the design of country programmes to advance rights and results for children. To this end an evidence synthesis was developed building on a wide variety of research about children and adolescents along with key internal exercises such as a gender, race and ethnicity programmatic review, a risk-informed programming exercise and a country programme evaluation. Finally, a human rights and results-based management learning in action programme engaged over 100 staff over a three-part journey to develop outcome-focused theories of change using system thinking, competency development and human-centred design tools.

In terms of fundraising, individual giving grew thanks to DRTV that acted as a catalyst, allowing conversion of donors by digital and telemarketing. This strategy has a double benefit of enhancing fundraising and positioning UNICEF among TV and digital audiences. Furthermore, having telemarketing and digital channels ready to convert, aligned with strategic media purchases and powerful spots, was crucial for taking advantage of moments such as the presidential elections in October 2022. Making decisions based on daily follow-up of the key performance indicators led to an improvement in the number of pledges per TV spot from 4.8 in 2021 to 7.3 in 2022.

Visits by operations colleagues to field offices provided opportunities to address organizational problems allowing theidentification of responses and actions according to contexts and areas (human resources, ICT, procurement, finance, administration, security).
Following the results of UNICEFPulse Survey, the Country Management Team worked closely with the staff association and human resources to conduct focus groups to better understand the issues behind some of the results where staff ratings had decreased. This allowed for an authentic dialogue on enablers and barriers for living UNICEF values. The results of the focus groups will serve as the road map for using the 2023 staff retreat as a space for designing actionable solutions.
"
LACR,Chile,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Flexibility, adaptability and clear guidelines to achieve results
One important lesson learned during this country programme period has been the value of having clear long-term priorities while also being flexible enough to adapt to changing circumstances. The Country Programme Document for 2018–2022 originally included plans to implement pilot programmes to improve equity and social inclusion in three local governments. However, due to the change in government and its new priorities, it was decided to postpone these pilot programmes and instead work with the government at the local level to create Local Offices for Children. UNICEF provided technical support for the design and implementation of this initiative, identifying both challenges and opportunities for consolidating the child protection system at this level. At the same time, UNICEF continued to advocate for and provide technical support for the passage of a law creating a comprehensive child protection system which was enacted in March 2022. 

In 2019, the social unrest and increased involvement of adolescents in protests required further adjustments to UNICEF’s workplan, as resources were redirected to support teachers and families with children during the instability and to develop methodologies for promoting children’s participation in dialogues. UNICEF also adjusted its actions to provide technical support to the social agenda and other new initiatives. 

The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 also necessitated adjustments to the workplan as the context changed dramatically and many government sectors modified their priorities. UNICEF was able to maintain its long-term priorities while providing technical support in critical areas such as social protection, immigration, juvenile justice and institutionalized children, and advocating with congress on relevant draft bills. Through careful planning and monitoring, UNICEF was able to maintain a coherent balance between the objectives of the Country Programme Document and its humanitarian and development efforts.

Evaluation
Improving the development of the evaluation function was a main subject of the 2022 AWP. As part of the RO recommendations and the incorporation of the new UNICEF evaluation policies, during 2022 the number of evaluations developed during the current CPD increased, reaching a total of 3 with the development of 2 programmatic evaluations in this year: (a) UNICEF contribution to CHCC, (b) evaluation of the implementation of the emergency response. UNICEF's support contributes to the inclusion of a children's rights approach in the actions of institutions such as the Undersecretariat for Children, and in mechanisms for promotion and comprehensive protection such as the Law of Guarantees, adequately identifying the needs of children and adolescents and generating proposals for the gradual incorporation of this perspective (Relevance). In the case of the evaluation of the implementation of the emergency response, among the lessons learned are: (i) the services respond to the needs of the target population (situational analysis); (ii) the right holders widely value the contribution that the services provided make to meet their needs; (iii) the CATs work in coordination with other agencies (e.g., the CATs); (iv) the services provided by the CATs are not only provided to the target population, but also to the community at large. coordination with other actors of the network, constituting a platform to facilitate platform for facilitating the access of its target population to services provided by other partners. partners. 
 
Office of the Ombudsperson for Children
Since 2018, UNICEF has supported the establishment of the Office of the Ombudsperson for Children, especially during the social unrest in 2019, as an independent human rights institution promoting the monitoring of children’s well-being – both those who participated in the demonstrations or were affected by police procedures. 

The partnership with the Office of the Ombudsperson for Children has enabled relevant learning for UNICEF regarding the complementary role of both institutions and recognition of the office by state counterparts. The Office of the Ombudsperson for Children and UNICEF complemented their actions by monitoring the situation of children in alternative residential care settings and advocating for the closure of large care centres. 

Throughout 2022, UNICEF, in coordination with the Office of the Ombudsperson for Children, provided technical assistance to the new government and its technical teams to enhance the institutional transformations required to consolidate the establishment of the Child Protection System and ensure specialized protection for children on the move or whose rights have been violated. In this context, the coordination and mutual collaboration between the institutions was critical to strengthen the capacities of human resources, particularly for those protecting adolescents in conflict with the law. 

Another relevant area of close work between UNICEF and the Office of the Ombudsperson for Children was the promotion of children’s participation. During the first years of implementation, UNICEF provided technical support to build capacities, conducting training and workshops to incorporate a participatory approach as a cross-cutting element in the institution’s strategic guidelines. Institutional collaboration was also promoted during the constituent process and during the establishment of regional Ombudsperson offices. This work has been documented as a case study in UNICEF’s ‘Global Guide’, to share the experience and best practices.

LACR,Colombia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Innovation: Multisectoral synergies and technical assistance for the inclusion of migrants in the national social protection system – a nexus model 
As the government began the registration of the migrant population covered by the temporary protection statute in the national social protection system, UNICEF Colombia identified the need to ensure that families with children are enrolled, to protect them from shocks, foster resilience and provide enhanced opportunities. This was a significant opportunity to transition from the purely humanitarian cash transfer schemes, set up mostly by other international cooperation actors as part of an immediate response, towards a long-term, scalable solution of a national social protection system – a straightforward example of the implementation of the humanitarian–development nexus in a middle-income country. 

During the government-led process of enrolling migrant families in the Identification System for Potential Beneficiaries of Social Protection Programmes (SISBEN), UNICEF identified the need to engage with potential beneficiaries using an almost one-to-one community-based approach to active search in partnership with the National Planning Department, given that all potential beneficiaries are required to expressly initiate the enrolment process. This need became evident through local-level interventions, where it was clear that those who needed to enrol had no specific information or comprehension of what the social protection programmes consisted of and what the process was. Therefore, the UNICEF initiative used a social and behaviour change approach to reduce rumours, demand services and promote trust using three pillars:
 

 
Community-based information dissemination using     local media channels, targeting specific communities, with an     understanding of persisting rumours and information gaps in each one 
Field teams conducting active search for     potential beneficiaries and walking each person through the entire     enrolment process, including responding to questions on a case-by-case     basis and clarifying misleading or false information  
A call centre with databases of all UNICEF     projects, reaching out to individuals to assess eligibility and guide     families through the enrolment process. 
     
     
These pillars were underpinned by a robust AAP strategy that sought to incorporate community feedback in real time to adjust the programme, in partnership with the national authorities responsible for enrolment. UNICEF support to this enrolment process focused on four departments. The outcome of these efforts was an accelerated enrolment process and an expansion in the number of migrants accessing social protection benefits. Overall, the strategy reached over 214,000 people through community-based media, over 16,300 people through information-sharing interactions, and 293 people who participated in the local content development. Clarifying doubts and concerns of potential beneficiaries accelerated the rate at which families became eligible for social protection benefits, including but not limited to government cash transfers. Following implementation of the community-led strategy, the national authorities reported that it positively affected the demand for social services by increasing registration in the target municipalities, especially in territories where the infrastructure to ensure registration was no longer available. This evidence confirms that multisectoral social and behaviour change strategies can address both structural and social barriers to facilitate inclusion of vulnerable families in the Colombian social protection system.

Lesson learned: Preparedness and forecasting for triple emergencies – enhancing the peace–development–migration–natural disasters continuum
The ‘multiple emergency’ concept took on a whole new meaning for Colombia in 2022. There were significant overlaps between those affected by natural disasters (floods), conflict-related forced displacement and migration (not only from Venezuela into Colombia but also from about 45 countries towards Central and North America through the treacherous Darién Gap). UNICEF’s role was to ensure a child focus in all emergency preparedness and response initiatives for these various crises. 
 
Although the UNICEF response was evidence-based through Multi-Cluster Initial Rapid Assessments, the overlap between multiple emergencies demands proactive forecasting. Furthermore, the evaluation of the response to the Venezuela migration crisis concluded that an information system that identifies differential needs of the most vulnerable groups (e.g. people from ethnic minorities and people with disabilities) is needed. In addition, accountability to affected populations needs to be ensured through mechanisms capable of identifying needs from their communities’ particular perspectives, reducing risks associated with power imbalance and PSEA, and to promoting participation of communities. Traditional information and data collection systems become insufficient in such dynamic and fluid settings

Although there are national policies and regulations in place for emergency preparedness, the focus of these systems on children could be enhanced, and their multi-level linkages strengthened by multi-pronged forecasting systems that also incorporate an ethnic approach. This has become an essential component of UNICEF’s efforts towards risk-informed emergency preparedness capacity-building at national and local levels in 2023. In addition to strengthening these national capacities, UNICEF’s own internal mechanisms – including UNICEF’s AAP mechanisms or tools, not just implementing partners’ evidence (as recommended by the evaluation of UNICEF’s response to the Venezuela migration crisis) – will benefit from such forecasting systems for a more targeted approach to pre-positioning supplies; micro-focused training of local stakeholders according to the specific local typology of the emergency; and prevention strategies where children are most at risk through local-level partnerships, taking into account the effects of climate change and the need for resilient education strategies that can overcome multiple emergencies and ensure continuity of learning. 

UNICEF leadership in this regard will also seek to mainstream a child focus on the different emergency coordination platforms among United Nations agencies and humanitarian actors.

LACR,Costa Rica,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF Costa Rica will close a five-year cooperation cycle in February 2023. Key lessons learned from the reviews of the Country Programme 2018 to 2023 include the need to (1) evolve from a ‘modelling’ to a ‘scale-up and inclusion’ programme approach to benefit children, adolescent and families who are still left behind and not benefiting from the country’s overall development; (2) ensure more robust gender-transformative programming to be achieved through the inclusion of specific interventions in each of the programme components, integrating the gender approach both in the analysis of contexts and inequalities in general, as well as in the vulnerabilities that affect children and especially adolescent girls, promoting gender-responsive actions and social norms change;and (3) enhance partnerships with the private sector and key leaders from Afro-descendent, migrant and Indigenous communities, persons with disabilities and women’s organizations.
The work with individual donors and the private sector has proved promising and effective, opening up several opportunities to partner with individuals, companies and associations to benefit children and adolescents, especially those from vulnerable communities. The individual donor base increased from around 20 donors in 2021 to more than 1,600 in December 2022, mobilizing over 95,000 US dollars up to December 2022. Therefore, UNICEF Costa Rica will prioritize private sector fundraising activities in the next programme cycle. 
UNICEF Costa Rica must also continue to reinforce its emergency preparedness, response and recovery work, enhancing the emergency–development nexus approach. With an increase in mixed migration flows crossing and coming to Costa Rica and several climate-related emergencies (such as large- or medium-scale flooding occurring at least twice a year, droughts regularly affecting the Pacific coast, and ongoing volcanic activity, earthquakes and disease outbreaks), it is imperative to mainstream humanitarian work across all sectors and interventions, with a prevention and resilience-building focus. 
Recommendations derived from the evaluation of the Country Programme between 2018 and February 2023 include the need to: (1) strengthen monitoring and evaluation to estimate UNICEF’s contribution at all levels; (2) establish a direct relationship between the Country Programme and the national planning system; (3) build and monitor the theory of change of the new Country Programme; and (4) propose tangible and achievable results according to the Country Office’s technical, financial and human capacities. 
The proposed new Country Programme Document 2023–2027, to be approved by the UNICEF Board in February 2023, has included the above-mentioned lessons and recommendations, ensuring solid, relevant and contextualized programming, advocacy and partnerships to advance children’s rights in Costa Rica.  
The robust evidence analysis and the vast consultative process to develop the new UNSDCF 2023–2027 (‘Closing gaps for a Sustainable and inclusive Costa Rica’) have proved successful, leading to the approval and launch of the new United Nations cooperation cycle by the President of the Republic in November 2022, with the engagement of high-level executive, legislative and judicial authorities, as well as the private sector and civil society. 
While Costa Rica is well known for its progress on social affairs, the relatively high scores it has attained in health, education, WASH and other social indicators hide persistent historical inequities in 25 out of 84 municipalities, mainly on the Pacific and Caribbean coasts and in border areas and peri-urban areas of the country. Historical disparities and exclusions regarding gender, family income and place of birth persist, mainly affecting Indigenous, Afro-descendent and migrant populations, and children with disabilities. Jointly with the rest of the United Nations System, under the UNSDCF, the new Country Programme will target its downstream interventions in these areas. Besides geographic targeting, the Country Programme will also seek to reach the same child with multiple interventions,thereby addressing multiple deprivations and enhancing the impact, efficiency and effectiveness of its interventions.
The two innovative UNICEF Costa Rica programmatic interventions in 2022 were the creation of the Judicial Mentoring Model and the reading and writing INSPIRA volunteering programme, which was consolidated in the reporting year. The former was implemented in coordination with the Office of Restorative Justice of the Judicial System to address the growing number of adolescents in conflict with the law who fail to comply with the alternative measures ordered by judges. The programme comprises 24 mentors who provide orientation and accompaniment to adolescents and young people on the design and execution of an effective social reintegration plan that allows them to fulfil their life projects.
UNICEF Costa Rica’s INSPIRA volunteering programme was consolidated in 2022 by scaling up its literacy and life-skills initiative which targets girls and boys from highly vulnerable migrant communities nationwide. Through a cascade mobilization and training programme, 150 volunteers were engaged in extramural education activities to support children from impoverished families to recover from the learning losses resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2018 teachers’ strikes. Around 1,000 children have started to benefit from this reading and writing skills programme which engages community volunteers. 

"
LACR,Cuba,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"During 2022, the CO conducted two evaluations:
-        The Formative Evaluation of Human Milk Banks (HMB) that documents the need of optimize the effectiveness of the intervention processes through: (a) methodological guidelines for the management of processes, (b) certified human resources dedicated full-time to the work, (c) HMB specific strategy and theory of change. It also recommends: (a)Prepare a National Strategy for the HMB management and increase promotional and educational actions, (b) strengthen community participation and training and certification of human resources, (c) develop a statistical information system for the control, monitoring and comparability between territories and (c) guarantee the HMB technological maintenance.
 
-        The evaluation of the project Strengthening of Protective Environments in Old Havana recommends to: (a) negotiate with the Municipal Health Directorate, the possibility of providing a first aid kit for the centres linked to the project where activities are carried out with children and adolescents and develop training on its use, (b) review, adapt and guarantee the use of communication products that include a possible referral route for physical or psychological care for children and adolescents who are identified as being at risk of violence, (c) promote the training of the team of adults involved in activities with children and adolescents on issues related to the prevention of violence and the referral route to the corresponding entities for treatment
 
The kit for adolescents for expression and innovation proved to be relevant in the Cuban context as a methodological resource that allows UNICEF to widen and strengthen the work with this age group. The kits have complemented the efforts of UNICEF and its counterparts for developing life skills, preventing all forms of violence that affect children and adolescents and providing psychosocial support. Additionally, they have contributed to articulating the work of various institutions complementing the efforts of counterparts and UNICEF programmatic areas, as well as becoming a gateway for new scenarios, including in emergency contexts.
 
The current update and review of the legal and normative frameworks (including policies for children and adolescents) offered the opportunity for UNICEF to provide technical support on children’s rights and highlight the need to work towards an integrated child protection system. The UNICEF approach to child protection was recognized and appreciated by national authorities, civil society and the media and by other key stakeholders and the general population. The need to strengthen alliances with the Ministry of Labor and Social Security and the Federation of Cuban Women was highlighted, as part of mapping key actors engaged in the protection of child and adolescent rights and well-being.
 
The alliances achieved with the technical teams of MINED have enabled the scaling up of many of the planned activities, while also guaranteeing their sustainability. The rapid scaling of infant care centres, to reach 60 by the end of 2022, was possible thanks to the close collaboration with the early childhood department and the commitment of the minister of education. Likewise, progress on strengthening the psychopedagogical teams at 54 vocational schools and the life skills training was achieved thanks to the collaboration and close coordination with the technical-professional teaching department. However, it is necessary to strengthen these alliances and replicate them with the special education department and the different levels of the MINED science and technology department, so as to attain greater and more effective results.
 
The programme has made good progress in changing the perceptions and negative attitudes towards children and adolescents with intellectual disability and autism who are included in regular education and in vocational schools. However, in order to achieve better scalability and sustainability it is important to better measure and document results and strengthen the skills of counterparts in this area.
 
The hybrid modality for training and skills development (in person and online) and the use of multimedia platforms and WhatsApp groups proved to be efficient in advancing the implementation of the cooperation programme during COVID-19. However, it should be accompanied by a feasibility assessment to check accessibility and connectivity and by regular training on digital skills. The creation of multimedia classrooms aimed at building digital, transferable and job-specific skills in vocational schools, including DRR education, will guarantee effective online training and the use of open-source educational resources for education and community training.
 
The acquisition of essential medical supplies and medicines has been crucial for maintaining and strengthening the response capabilities of the NHS. Nearly 85 per cent of budget allocated to health was linked to emergency response, with a large component in medical supplies. UNICEF and MINSAP created a purchasing committee, with the participation of experts in the sector, which optimizes the procurement process, including the selection of supplies compatible with country infrastructure, available resources and execution times, facilitating internal coordination for the delivery of supplies meant to save lives. However, market limitations linked to sanctions and international logistics have been a substantial bottleneck and have delayed deliveries, greatly limiting the MINSAP's capacity to provide rapid emergency response.

LACR,Dominican Republic,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Changes in development cooperation need time. The importance of long-term resilience, not abandoning programmes when progress is not seen, and the continuity and strengthening of efforts despite the pandemic and the change of Government, have borne much fruit this year. The following programmes needed the entire period of the current CPD to show significant progress: 
a)  The prevention of child marriage, 
b)  The Mothers and Babies in Good Care Initiative, 
c)  The programme to improve foundational learning, CON BASE, and
d)  The disability and emergency bonuses.
 
To achieve programme results that could be turned into public policy, it is necessary high-level evidence-based political advocacy, advocacy at the middle-management level and technical assistance, in a coordinated manner, and, on some issues, public advocacy. It is necessary to be prepared to take advantage of the opportunities that may arise to do political advocacy, and, on other occasions, to create these scenarios. This strategy has been used in the previous examples.

It is important that UNICEF's flagship programmes, which have the potential to become public policy, involve public fundraising. During 2022, the MOE secured significant funding for the foundational learning enhancement programme, CON BASE, for its implementation across the country, over the next three years.  The Social Protection programme, SUPERATE, is funding the recruitment of a significant number of additional staff in municipalities where the implementation of the EU prevention programme has started. However, in other programmes where partners did not prioritize and secure the budget, even if it was not a significant amount, results were minimal. 

Innovation, whether in innovative strategies, such as Mother and Babies in Good Care, or in methodological innovations for the country, such as CON BASE Program, or in innovation of digital tools for the implementation of programmes, is very important to achieve successful results. If the development of these innovations is done jointly with the counterparts, the period required for their acceptance is reduced. Additional effort and training will always be required when expanding the initiatives.

In 2022 UNICEF designed a technology tool, the Early Warning App, and completed the digital system for measuring child development, SIMEDID, has begun the digital certification of school centers, which also includes a digital evaluation system, and has also strengthened the App NUTRE-MUAC for the treatment of malnutrition.
Strategic alliances with academia have proven to be a catalyst for innovation. Alliances have been established with the University of the Basque Country for the digital certification of schools, with the Universidad Iberoamericana for the design of SIMEDID, and with FLACSO for the CON BASE programme.
 
UNICEF has been able to reach the most vulnerable population groups such as Venezuelan and Haitian migrants, undocumented individuals, population groups living in extreme poverty or living in difficult-to-access communities, thanks to its ability to mobilize civil society actors and to facilitate a tripartite alliance with Government institutions. In this way, it has been possible to vaccinate these population groups against COVID-19, and to offer them humanitarian assistance.
"
LACR,Ecuador,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The 2019–2022 Country Programme evaluation made recommendations such as: (1) improving coordination between national and local levels; and (2) strengthening UNICEF’s public and private alliances to improve advocacy efforts to advance the rights of children. The implementation of the new Country Programme Document 2023–2026 is an opportunity for UNICEF to improve coordination between national work and local needs, strengthen its alliances and play a brokering role in support of children.
 
To improve coordination between the national and local levels
With the new Country Programme Document, UNICEF has the opportunity to revamp its field presence strategy. In 2023, UNICEF will reinforce its presence in the following provinces:
 

Esmeraldas,     a coastal province along the border with Colombia, which has seen a rapid     rise in violence against children associated with organized crime. In     2020, 80 murders were reported, compared with 325 murders in the first     eight months of 2022.[1]  
Sucumbíos,     a province in the Amazon basin on the Colombian border. Here, UNICEF will     focus on violence, human mobility and reaching the most vulnerable Indigenous     children and women in the Amazon basin.  
Chimborazo,     a province in the central highlands, where 38% of the population are Indigenous,[2]     and 48.8% of children under 5 suffer from chronic malnutrition (the highest     incidence in the country).[3]
Pichincha and Guayas, home to 44% of the total population of Ecuador. Here UNICEF will work to support upstream strategies to reinforce the capacities of local authorities to design and implement public policies with a child perspective.
 
To strengthen public and private alliances to advance the rights of children: #ChildrenFirst strategy
Public finance for children should play a key role in Ecuador’s agenda to ensure that the country’s limited public resources are allocated to strategic, relevant policies and invested efficiently. Alternative financing must guarantee basic services and make them more efficient and effective. Budget processes, although technical, are first and foremost political processes, shaped by the power dynamics between stakeholders. Given its mandate and brokering role, UNICEF can focus all actors on the common goal of putting children first. Alliances with actors from different sectors (including economic, social, academic and media spheres) can raise awareness of the need to prioritize investment in children, especially the very young. UNICEF has begun work to build or strengthen bridges with these sectors, as described below.
 
According to the Latinobarómetro survey in 2020, 59.5% of people trust the Church, while only 9.4% think they can trust most other people.[4] As a result of the civil unrest in June 2022, Ecuadorian society became further fragmented, with discrimination and racism contributing to polarization. In addition, the impact on children and adolescents of more than two years of school closures requires transformative action involving all sectors of society. Following recommendations in the 2019–2022 Country Programme evaluation, UNICEF launched an ambitious advocacy strategy to bring people and sectors together to work for children in Ecuador. The #ChildrenFirst strategy advocates for a more equitable, prosperous, and peaceful country that will be possible only if social actors prioritize children and if authorities allocate more funds and invest more efficiently in children. With a focus on evidence, alliances, campaigning, celebrities, media and special events, it is a long-term strategy that UNICEF will develop throughout the new Country Programme Document 2023–2026 cycle.
 
Within the framework of World Children’s Day and the anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNICEF presented information about the situation of children,[5] and invited 100 actors from children’s rights civil society organizations, the private sector, the diplomatic corps, the media and adolescent girls’ groups to join the initiative. UNICEF will continue to promote the initiative in 2023 to other relevant actors, such as Indigenous groups, academics and young people. UNICEF invited the President of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to visit Ecuador to help advocate with women’s rights organizations to include children’s issues (such as orphans of femicide, children affected by violence against women) in their agendas, and with bilateral donors to include children in their portfolios.
 
The #ChildrenFirst communications material included a jingle,[6] produced with local singers, which reached 5.9 million people through news media, 2.4 million through social media and 1.7 million people through TV, radio and outdoor advertising. On 8 December 2022, UNICEF hosted a special event for more than 400 people.[7]
 
Under the #ChildrenFirst initiative, UNICEF will support:
·       the private sector to adopt family-friendly policies
·       academia to conduct research on children’s issues
·       civil society to monitor the situation of children
·       Indigenous groups and feminist movements to include children’s issues in their agendas
·       journalists and opinion leaders to disseminate messages about the situation of children.

It will also aim to attract donors and lobby national and local authorities to improve services and increase investment.

LACR,El Salvador,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Year one of the CPD 2022–2026 implementation yielded the following lessons learned:
·       The Government’s investment in ECD and children (0–8 years) since assuming office in June 2019 has proved central to its change agenda. Through leveraging international and national evidence, UNICEF supported El Salvador's original ECD investment case, with UNICEF's technical assistance subsequently enabling its implementation in territory. UNICEF continues to work closely with the Office of the First Lady, the World Bank and IADB to support the Government investment portfolio for ECD of USD 500 million, showcasing the relevance of partnering with International Financial Institutions to support increased social investment in children. 
·       To ensure that a comprehensive focus on child rights and state investment in children 0–8 is sustainable in the second decade, renewed attention is required for older children and adolescents. A life-cycle approach to adolescent development and participation is required, identifying critical risks, milestones, and opportunities for realizing children’s rights from the first decade through the second. For example, education continues to face historical challenges with net enrolment rates dropping significantly from 81.2% to 41.1% in the transition from elementary to high school.
·       UNICEF and specialized child rights entities continue to express concern about the regressive reforms to the Juvenile Justice Law (March 2022) and the Law Against Organized Crime (October 2022). According to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, detention should only be used as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period. Non-custodial measures are more cost-effective than detention and generate better outcomes for children and society at large.
·       Whole-of-society efforts addressing unsubstantiated stigmatization of adolescents and the regression of their rights is required. Adolescent children appear disproportionally stigmatized as fuelling gang violence: During the state of exception, some 61,300 people were detained, of which 2,464 were adolescents. Approximately 1,000 have been released.
·       The importance of addressing child labour is evidenced by 2021 data.
·       New legislative frameworks to strengthen co-responsibilities between public and private sectors to promote the rights of children related to health and nutrition (such as laws promoting breastfeeding and the rights to water and sanitation) are essential to encourage whole-of-society approaches for the optimum development of children in El Salvador.
·       Continued strengthening of psychosocial support, including mental health services, is necessary for students returning to school, victims of violence, including GBV and violence suffered by adolescents in conflict with the law, migrants, and internally displaced persons, to strengthen their resilience and facilitate their societal reintegration. Resources are needed to strengthen specialized services for children on the move, including those internally displaced and returnees, to continue supporting Government and civil society efforts.
·       According to the findings of the Regional Real-time Assessment of UNICEF's Support to the COVID-19 Vaccine Rollout and the Strengthening of the National Immunization Programme, national and local governments recognized the country office's contribution in strengthening cold-chain capacity, risk communications and community engagement to address misinformation and increase demand for COVID-19 and routine vaccination. Furthermore, UNICEF El Salvador's close collaboration with WHO/PAHO in sharing technical expertise and additional resources with the Ministry of Health under a single work plan was highlighted positively as “sharing the same stage” and raised the reputation of the UN with the Government and other stakeholders. 
 
UNICEF innovations contributing to achieving important results for children in 2022.
·       UNICEF strengthened institutional capacity for digital birth registration through unique identity numbers at birth, supporting the Executive’s Secretariat of Innovation by increasing operational capacity of the National Registry of Natural Persons in two of the main maternity hospitals. Their registration units received computer equipment for the entry of medical and identity records and generation of a unique ID code at birth. Equipment was provided to enable more systematic tracking and monitoring of new-borns, as well as the linking of maternal and neonatal digital data from birth through to hospital discharge. These achievements addressed a previously highlighted need to equip delivery rooms for control of mothers and children, including internet connection, adequate equipment, and trained personnel.
·       UNICEF met its prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA) targets, with 99% of its partners achieving low risk status, leading among UN agencies in PSEA implementation and supporting the Resident Coordinator and system agencies in El Salvador in meeting PSEA requirements. To promote ongoing and sustainable PSEA training of UN system partners, the country office developed an online Agora course in Spanish benefiting over 250 individuals to date and being used by other UN agencies.
·       The joint ITU, UNICEF and GIGA initiative to bring connectivity to schools supported the Government in its connectivity mapping process to enable decision makers to have information in real time for all schools.
·       Given children with disabilities are vulnerable to violence, UNICEF worked with partners to promote an inclusive approach. UNICEF produced resources for children and adolescents with visual and auditory impairments designed to support them and their caregivers in seeking urgent care within the first 72 hours in cases of sexual violence. These resources, adapted in braille and LESSA sign language, are available to first-line responders, including civil society organizations.
·       UNICEF worked with the Ministry of Health to create a manual addressing violence prevention for women and adolescents, including GBV, that is complemented by a virtual training module for Ministry of Health personnel through a train-the-trainer approach and represents a breakthrough in specialized care for victims of sexual violence, especially in its emphasis on the importance of psychological first aid and its gender-sensitive focus.
UNICEF supported the Ministry of Health vision for health sector transformation predicated on the decentralization of the national health system through innovation and geared towards strengthening first-level care in communities and developing training. Through integrated courses, 300 health professionals from the Ministry of Health, Military Health, municipalities, churches, universities, and civil society organizations were trained in the comprehensive care for children (CCD) methodology and Kangaroo strategy, thereby 
"
LACR,Guatemala,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons learned:

 
·       The model of integrated brigades is an important achievement that will benefit the population. MoH has now assigned funding for these brigades for 2023.  
·       Weak electrical connectivity still hampers the expansion of immunization services to the rural and most remote areas of     the country, where the vulnerable populations live. To overcome this     problem, UNICEF supported MoH to procure electric generators so that electrical cold chain equipment can be properly powered, as well as solar cold chain equipment, which doesn’t require any electrical connections. 
·       Massive immunization communication campaigns did not have the expected impact on increasing the population’s interest to get vaccinated against COVID-19. As a result, UNICEF and AVANCSO supported MoH with the development and implementation of a community participation methodology that allows health workers and community members to interact and share their concerns on vaccination and other health issues.
·       The wide recognition and legitimacy that UNICEF Guatemala has in the country served to participate in the strategic promotion of vaccination against COVID-19.
·       UNICEF's adaptive capacity facilitated interventions to support the deployment of the COVID-19 vaccine in the country.
·       It is necessary to maximize the agility of the procurement processes for equipment and supplies to counteract delays and bottlenecks in global supply chains outside of UNICEF.
·       UNICEF's advocacy and assistance were key to come     up with an updated, equity-based Education Sector Plan, which places     adequate emphasis on strengthening ECD and non-formal education programmes.
·       Having a dedicated WASH Specialist in the Education team has been key in moving the WASH in Schools at the ministry and local levels. Strengthening     national institutions’ commitment to the integrated response to children     and adults on the move based on CAPIMRs will be key in accelerating scale-up     and improve sustainability 
·       Rigorous analytical     studies are an invaluable instrument to influence public policy and budget     decisions, both at the national and the local levels.
·       Lessons learned from the evaluation of the UNICEF response to ETA and IOTA in Guatemala  
o  Choosing sound partners and building on existing community processes is important to ensure the continuity of interventions as well as ensuring that these processes are strengthened rather than interrupted by humanitarian interventions.
o  Working in partnership with the Ministry of Education, the Education Cluster, the municipalities, and the participation of the communities and the steering committees of the schools, as well as the parents' associations, is a recipe to ensure that the activities are successful and sustainable. 
o  Although UNICEF has access to finance the installation of temporary education modules after an emergency, their installation may not be the best option and it is important to consult with the community to investigate if there are more suitable and sustainable alternatives.
 
 
Innovations: 
 
·       Integrated health and nutrition brigades represent a successful programmatic innovation to bring primary prevention services closer to the most remote communities. Roving brigades made up by nurses and community outreach personnel who spoke local languages travel to hard-to-reach areas of the country providing immunization, weight and height monitoring, micronutrient and vitamins supplementation, as well as advice on nutrition, health and hygiene.

·       UNICEF-supported ECD centers (Centros Comunitarios de Desarrollo Infantil Integral - CECODII) provide children aged 0 to 4 years with holistic interventions on early learning, health, nutrition and protection in a culturally appropriate manner relying on the collaboration of community educators and managers, supporting mothers, fathers and caregivers to strengthen their knowledge and parenting practices to promote the development of their children. 

·       Over the years, in Guatemala SAHTOSO became a more holistic approach than its predecessor Community Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) as, through similar behavioural-change-based methodology it ends human feco-oral transmission in rural communities and not just end open defecation. It does so by ensuring full community coverage to sanitation and hygiene services and empower families to safely treat and store drinking water at home. The last feco-oral route is the protection of food from fecal contamination which will be systematically integrated into SAHTOSO in 2023. This way and in only few months the communities are free from feco-oral diseases originated from human excreta.  

·       UNICEF-backed non-formal education centers (Centros de Educación Extraescolar – CEEX) provide education and transferable, job-related and entrepreneurial skills opportunities at the primary and secondary levels to out-of-school adolescents and youth, in blended and distance modalities. 

·       Municipal child protection offices (Oficina Municipal de Protección de la Niñez y Adolescencia -OMPNA) aim at the prevention, care, detection, referral and monitoring of cases of violence against children and adolescents. Under the premise to decentralize VAC-relates service provision, OPMNAs allow for inter-institutional articulation among state and social actors linked to the national protection system to provide timely and effective prevention and response services to children victim of violence.

·       In social policy, the work on improving planning and budget management at the municipal level represent a programmatic innovation that allows to decidedly impact on the life of children on the ground. 

·       Together with the National Secretariat of Science and Technology of Guatemala (SENACYT), UNICEF launched the Junior National Innovation Award category (An opportunity for innovation with and for children and adolescents) to raise awareness and promote a culture of innovation among children and adolescents. The Junior category of the National Innovation Award 2022 sought to generate a space for participation, creativity, and critical thinking in boys and girls between the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades (modality I) of elementary school and middle-level adolescents (modality II). In this space, children and adolescents presented innovative ideas to improve the educational context in which they are developing. 

·       Continued support was provided to the Secretariat for Social Welfare (SBS) to scale-up the implementation of the Child Protection Information Management System (CPIMS+ Primero), an open-source software platform that helps managing protection-related data, with tools that facilitate case management, incident monitoring and family tracing and reunification.

·       Within the framework of the behavioural change strategy of the GCNN, UNICEF implemented RapidPro-based, culturally-sensitive messaging service for pregnant women, which allowed for increased reach.

LACR,Guyana,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Strengthening primary  health care, including immunization services for children, by building on  COVID-19 response investments 

Essential  primary health care and regular immunization for children are areas of concern  in Guyana and Suriname. Consequently, an increased focus on  strengthening health system resilience to ensure both countries can  withstand unexpected and future pandemics and avert ensuing crises remains a  priority. It is time to strengthen primary health care, including  immunization services for children, by building on COVID-19 response investments. In addition, for COVID-19 vaccination and  routine immunization, should be integrated into primary health-care services  and enable the transition from emergency response to development programming  to build back better. The use of tools such as the supervisory  checklist for vaccination, the cold chain assessment checklist,  including site readiness assessment, and standard operating procedures on vaccine  management to meet global best practices have the potential to improve  programme performance.  The Real-Time  Assessment of UNICEF’s support to the COVID-19 vaccine rollout highlights that the tailoring to the  inherent strength of health systems, UNICEF’s contribution to vaccination  services would be more effective. The COVID-19 vaccine investment  is an entry point to strengthening Routine  Immunization

Systems-strengthening  towards education reform, transforming education and increasing opportunities  for children with disabilities 

  Continuous  technical support, including capacity-building at the national and sub-national  levels and the synchronization of ideas and strategies between implementing  partners’ leadership and technical officers and UNICEF, are critical for  timely implementation, tracking progress and reporting. It is imperative to  continue to invest in and equip children to be able to learn through various  modalities of learning to mitigate learning loss. With face-to-face education  being fully utilized again, the urgency for establishing online modalities  has subsided. Increased effort is required to continue to advocate and  support opportunities for online learning, including for children with  disabilities. Diversification of the partnership approach has strengthened  the breadth and depth of implementation capacity to achieve results,  particularly through civil society organizations, to target children in  remote areas and hinterlands. 

UNICEF’s  role in rapidly developing economies 

UNICEF’s  role in Guyana and Suriname is evolving, especially in Guyana, due to rapid  economic growth driven by oil resources. However, the realization of  children’s rights and the transformation of their lives are not evolving at a  corresponding pace – there are still significant pockets of inequities, and  children left behind are not brought up to speed at the same rate of  development. Building the capacity of practitioners can contribute to  protecting the investments that UNICEF has already made for children and  adolescents and situates its work on the programme sustainability continuum.  UNICEF will continue to strengthen the national capacity for PF4C, advocating  for fiscal space, strengthening the social protection system and addressing  child poverty.  

Innovative  partnership for a cross-border programme for the development and promotion of  multilingualism in schools in Suriname and French Guyana

  UNICEF  convened a unique innovative partnership between a wide range of partners  (Ministry of Education of Suriname, Rectorat de Guyane Française, Anton de  Kom University in Paramaribo, Université de Guyane, the French Embassy in  Paramaribo, Communauté Territoriale de Guyane (CTG), UNICEF French and Dutch  National Committees) to jointly develop a comprehensive programme to achieve  better academic success on both sides of the border, by acknowledging and  developing children’s language skills. This approach will support the  professionalization of French teachers in Paramaribo and the introduction of  French classes in Surinamese schools and of Dutch in French-speaking  schools. It will also include research cooperation between  CTG/University of French Guyana and Anton de Kom University to build  inclusive universities in both countries, as well as a pilot project to  develop the teaching of French, Dutch and native languages in Saint-Laurent  du Maroni and Albina.

Children  and youth participation 

  To  increase levels of participation in youth work, developing the appropriate technologies  will provide opportunities to build integrated online platforms to assist in  gathering data and critical information on children’s well-being. This is an  important step in transforming the approaches to services for children and  youth. 

Partnership  for mental health 

The partnership with the Ministry of Health and the University of Columbia was a  unique approach to advocating for mental health. Hosting the Mental Health  & Well-Being Conference provided an opportunity to advocate for urgent investment  in mental health, as it remains unfunded, as well as integrating mental  health interventions across the health, education and social protection  sectors.

Building  on the Country Programme Evaluation (2021), a Strategic Moment of Reflection  highlighted  the following priorities: overarching priorities (nexus; systemic change; coordination;  gender and youth participation); strengthening capacities (reinforcing monitoring,  evaluation, accountability and learning (MEAL); strengthening capacity development;  coordination & and advocacy frameworks);  and internal capacity strengthening  including multisectoral and integrated programming in line with the humanitarian-development-peacebuilding  (HDP) nexus. At regional level, UNICEF-Haiti participated in the  regional Real Time Assessment (RTA) on the COVID-19 vaccine roll  out.
  
  On this basis, UNICEF worked with partners to develop a new Country  Programme Document (CPD) for 2023-2027, with a budget of US$182.8  million, focused on strengthening integrated service delivery within  fragility contexts, while addressing longer-term systemic changes and  supporting emergency preparedness and response and with a humanitarian and  development (nexus) approach. Recommendations from the Real Time  Evaluation (RTE) of the UNICEF 2021 earthquake response and the Country  Programme Evaluation (CPE) were used to feed into the design of the new  Country Programme. 
  
Further  to the Common Country Analysis (CCA, 2021), which focused on the root  causes and risks associated with growing instability, UNICEF together with  the UN country team supported the elaboration of a Situation Analysis (SitAn,  2022) to understand immediate and underlying causes and leverage efforts  to address structural drivers of fragility and violence to feed into the  development of the Haiti UNSDCF 2023-2027.
  
  Significant progress was made in producing reliable data and evidence on  the situation of children. To support an integrated response in  vulnerable areas in the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince, UNICEF  together with national authorities conducted rapid health and nutrition  assessments in the metropolitan area, as well as a multi-donor needs assessment  (MSNA) exercise in partnership with REACH.  A new SMART nutrition survey,  which was planned for 2022, was postponed to 2023 due to security concerns.  The survey will provide up-to-date data on the prevalence of wasting and shed  light on exclusive breastfeeding among children under six months of age in  Haiti, which currently stands at 40%. 
  
  UNICEF needs to be fit for purpose to operate in this complex programmatic  environment shaped by multiple shocks and growing insecurity. Security  and access remain key concerns for programme implementation, and this has  required adjustments in the way of working to ensure access to vulnerable  populations while adhering to the principle of ‘do no harm’ and protecting  staff and those we are serving. A significant achievement in 2022 was  the acceleration and expansion of UNICEF humanitarian work in Port-au-Prince  to include activities in gang-controlled areas. Thanks to the hiring of  access specialist assets and strong collaboration at the inter-agency access  working group, UNICEF was able to deploy in Cité Soleil and Martissant to  provide water trucking and mobile health and nutrition clinics where services  have been closed due to gang violence and insecurity for over a year. 
  
  The need for integrated programming is particularly acute in the  metropolitan area around Port-au-Prince, where vulnerable communities  affected by extreme poverty and gang violence have very limited access to  basic social services. While Port-au-Prince, Cité Soleil, Gonaives, Saint  Marc and Carrefour alone account for 42% of unvaccinated children (Penta3) in  the country, UNICEF has worked with the Government, departmental authorities  and partners to develop integrated programming around immunization, maternal  and child health and nutrition, education and child protection services for  vulnerable children and their families. Multipurpose humanitarian cash  transfers (HCT) have shown significant added value in addressing the impacts  of various shocks on vulnerable households.
   
  Education will remain a key focus in 2023 and beyond. The validation  of the first national alternative education policy in 2020 opened the way for  an improved educational offer for half a million Haitian children outside the  school system. A key area will be to strengthen vocational training and  non-formal education to improve the employability of young people. There is  also a need to strengthen the involvement of the private sector (chambers of  commerce) in the training and professional reintegration of adolescents. 
    
  There is an acute need to prevent outbreaks of waterborne diseases  through awareness-raising on handwashing and essential emergency WASH and to  better prepare for climate-related emergencies through resilience and  disaster preparedness with vulnerable communities. In line with the  evaluation of the UNICEF WASH project in the departments of Artibonite and  Center (2014- 2019), UNICEF adopted a strategy to ensure the quality and  sustainability of sanitation where water system users pay. This strategy will  contribute to strengthen the capacity for maintenance of school sanitation  facilities and hygiene awareness. In the earthquake-affected area, UNICEF  also supported the launch of the water and sanitation for health facilities  improvement tool (WASH FIT) in South department and Nippes as a pilot before  scaling it up.
   
  Health system strengthening along with close collaboration and direct  support to decentralized structures and communities remain key areas of focus  for UNICEF programming, with significant investments to be made in 2023 and  beyond with the support of Global Affairs Canada. The ongoing establishment  of District level Health Units (UAS) is a major step towards operationalizing  the community health strategic plan and decentralizing the health-care  system. Providing key medical supplies and training for community health  workers will remain key priorities in 2023 and beyond.
   
  UNICEF  has been strengthening its outreach to adolescents and young people, partnering with  Digicel in campaigning to boost the reach of U-Report and strengthening ties  with the Ministry on the Status and Rights of Women (MCFDF) to better promote  adolescents’ and young people’s rights. Goodwill ambassadors and 1030 U-Reporters  (out of the 80,000 registered in Haiti) were trained and mobilized to promote  child rights, notably on school reopening, cholera prevention and  vaccination. During the September 2022 crisis, UNICEF partnered with SAKALA  to engage U-Reporters in providing psychosocial support to children,  adolescents, young people and their families in neighbourhoods affected by  gang violence.

LACR,Honduras,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Migration
One of the most innovative UNICEF strategies was the articulation of integrated actions for migrants, through partnerships in consortium with specialized organizations. By integrating their work in common intervention spaces, it has enabled the implementation of multisectoral actions and services for children and families in the areas of protection, health, education, social protection and WASH. The Consortium Life, has enabled a much better coordination between implementing partners, increasing efficiency in the joint actions, impact and visibility in the ground. The Consortium Life, co-led by UNICEF and ACH, and integrated by another four NGOs has established itself as a key player in immediate technical assistance, advocacy and provision of integrated services for migrant families.
 
Health and Nutrition
Within the framework of UNICEF support to the country for vaccine deployment, most of the resources were focused on supporting the cold chain, due to the challenges identified in the national vaccine deployment plan. However, it is recognized that in order to achieve better vaccination coverage against COVID-19 and the regular programme in 2023, greater emphasis should be given to the network of vaccinators, coordination and social mobilization.
 
Based on a recent assessment led by the UNICEF regional office that identifies weaknesses and opportunities in relation to information systems in the health sector, UNICEF identified the need to strengthen the health system’s epidemiological surveillance. As a demonstration experience, a dashboard has been shared with three health regions with interactive information from UNICEF implementing partners on the number of children assessed with the MUAC tape, number of children with acute malnutrition, children admitted to the programme and number of children recovered by each municipality. UNICEF should place more emphasis on technical and financial support in this area by 2023.
 
WASH
Assessment of the humanitarian response to the devastating effects of Tropical Storms Eta and Iota showed that the WASH sector was effective, as well as showing the need to provide humanitarian assistance on a larger scale from the onset of the emergency. As a lesson learned, inputs were prepositioned to assist 25,000 people in 2023 and two contingency programme documents were signed, which will allow a large-scale start-up in the first days of a potential humanitarian situation.
 
Some innovations from the sector were: a new cooperation model between child protection and WASH, for safe access to WASH services at the household level for returned migrants, with potential for scaling up; production and integration of standards for child-sensitive services in municipal emergency preparedness and response plans; and identification of climate action priorities for children at the municipal level for integration into institutional action plans.
 
Education
The early involvement of SEDUC officials in coordination and monitoring actions of the programmes undertaken by UNICEF and its partners not only expedites their implementation but also increases the possibility of institutionalizing and scaling up certain actions, as has occurred with the incorporation of sanitation elements in the school construction guide.
 
In terms of innovation, the combined Giga and Passport to Learning model has enabled accelerated digitization by considering the five key elements of the UNICEF global digitization of education model. The first three would be the provision of connectivity with Giga, platforms with the Learning Passport and content in connection with Educatrachos. This approach has also proven to have a direct catalytic effect on the other two elements of equipment and teacher training, since it has been possible to provide and leverage equipment (with the private sector and within the framework of official programmes) and to align educational instances.
 
Social protection
The development of more adequate financing strategies and greater efficiency in public investment for social protection is required in order to overcome limited fiscal space to promote social protection programmes, along with low investment execution capacity. These are windows of opportunity for interventions that UNICEF and other UN agencies can support.
 
Child protection
During the past three years, UNICEF has been able to implement and expand violence prevention strategies based on conflict de-escalation and outreach for social and behavioural change in favour of children’s rights and gender equality. There is an opportunity to systematize and strengthen the intervention models, to expand the implementation methodologies and identify the changes produced.
 
Regarding the specialized child protection system, it is undoubtedly necessary to continue strengthening the institutional capacities of the national protection authority but based on a more clearly defined logical framework that allows for improved monitoring of progress and measurement of results.
 
As an innovative component, self-care workshops have been conducted for field staff of implementing partners, which deal with how to prevent burnout and other mental health problems.

LACR,Jamaica,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"1.UNICEF-supported child protection system evaluation highlighted the broad consensus among stakeholders that the system lacks integration and is under-resourced and that rural areas are particularly underserved. This reconfirmed the need for UNICEF Jamaica to continue to influence Government priority-setting processes and budget allocations for child protection. Moving forward, particular emphasis will therefore be placed on making the investment case for child protection by demonstrating both the cost of inaction as well as the strong returns on investing. Furthermore, evidence generation will focus on obtaining robust data to support policy and budget decisions for child protection; this is to ensure that resources are better distributed to promote equitable spending with greater attention to disadvantaged groups and areas. Another important lesson learned from the system evaluation is that there is a need to address positive mental health and well-being as a holistic, life-course issue relevant to every sector of development. UNICEF will continue to address mental health as an office-wide, cross-cutting priority and advocate for greater Government investments for a well-planned, coordinated and multisectoral approach to expanding mental health and psychosocial support to children and their caregivers.
 
2.UNICEF continued to use and expand on innovative ways of delivering services to children and their parents through technology-based approaches. With UNICEF support, a telemental health service was established for children and adolescents in collaboration with MOEY and MOHW. UNICEF also supported the development of the ParentText messaging service, using UNICEF RapidPro technology that allows parents to receive tips and information through WhatsApp messages. The mental health U-Matter chatline launched in 2022 has already proven its utility as a sustainable support over text service for young people. The service will be handed over to MOHW for full operation at the end of 2023. Much is also expected of the implementation of the innovative Fundoo application that was initiated in 2022. It will facilitate access to relevant life skills content for adolescents and youth in several contexts. Fundoo is a chat-based learning platform delivered via WhatsApp using our U-Report social messaging service, with a curriculum based on the UNICEF 21st Century Skills framework.
 
3.The COVID-19 response provided a critical opportunity for UNICEF to contribute to the modernization and digitization of the Jamaican Government. In 2021, UNICEF supported the development and implementation of a state-of-the-art COVID 19 vaccine digital information management platform that was praised for its timeliness and quality. Building on this successful intervention, UNICEF is now supporting the digitization of the entire routine immunization registry, which will facilitate the monitoring of individual immunization schedules and the storage of individual immunization histories and, consequently, help enhance the performance of the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) in terms of both coverage and efficiency. In addition, the expertise gained through this process has enabled UNICEF to partner with MOEY in the development of a long overdue digital education management information system for Jamaica in collaboration with the World Bank and IDB. UNICEF has also recently initiated a collaboration with the minister of justice to support the digitalization of the child diversion programme management information system.

4.The experience over the past year in implementation of gender-responsive programmes focused on adolescent sexual and reproductive health and prevention of family violence programming has generated some key lessons learned.  The Teen Hub has shown that boys and girls are keen to access health services if they feel respected and safe.  This model facility has consistently received high service uptake and between January and November 2022, the MOHW reports that it received 4,036 visits from girls and 3,705 visits from boys. The Women’s Centre which serves teen mothers also highlights the need for more effective Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health among girls and a greater focus on issues around sexual consent for both girls and boys.  Family violence remains a formidable threat to the development and wellbeing of adolescent girls and therefore must remain priority for the Jamaica country office. Male engagement has been a focus of the Spotlight Programme and has shown promising results with men engaging men as facilitators of community conversations on the issue.  Meanwhile, the survivor-centred approach, has also been applied to engage women and girls who have been victims to access counselling and other health and justice related services.

LACR,"LACRO, Panama",Lessons Learned and Innovations,"

LACR,Mexico,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Throughout the past years, UNICEF has found  challenging to influence federal-level decision makers to generate lasting change, as often there is more focus on the immediate needs and less dialogue and exchange about mid-term goals and results. Nonetheless, UNICEF continues to find areas of opportunity and influence at federal level, and the office has significantly expanded its work at the subnational level, where there is relatively more openness and interest in joint work, which needs to be taken advantage of. As a result, UNICEF has been able to combine both levels of work to generate more impact and results for children and adolescents.
 
The work at state and municipal levels has not only focused on humanitarian responses but has shifted to bring greater attention to longer-term development interventions in key sectors, such as health and nutrition, education and child protection. This shift towards more strategic work at the subnational level has been possible thanks to enhanced human resources in the field offices and programme areas, with greater expertise and capacities to engage in policy dialogue. In addition, UNICEF has moved forward in establishing formal working agreements with diverse state institutions, which have generated more formal and concrete commitments to work on actions and programmes in favour of children’s and adolescents’ rights.
 
Another lesson learned is that it is crucial to have sufficient financial resources, not only for humanitarian actions but also to finance longer-term development efforts. The office currently receives large contributions from the US Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM), mainly to address humanitarian issues related to migration, but there is an urgent need to diversify sources of funding to ensure sufficient resources to cover longer-term development efforts not associated with humanitarian situations in the context of migration, such as strengthening access and quality of education, as well as health and nutrition services for children, among others. This will enable the necessary growth of the office in terms of human resources.  At the same time, the rapid growth of the office requires both better risk management and greater coordination between the different areas of work; effective and efficient communication and coordination are crucial to provide a timely and quality response.  
 
UNICEF promoted various innovations within its programme areas, crosscutting areas and field offices. For example, UNICEF continued spearheading technology-based solutions to promote education continuity, close learning gaps and support mental health, with a focus on adolescence. This work included the launching of the Learning Passport to support remedial and remote learning. Rapid-pro continues to be a great tool for adolescent-focused support, especially in the context of remote classes due to COVID-19 closures and fluctuations in migration flows. UNICEF also implemented a role-modelling and mentoring structured component in the skills for life and work emergency response, as well as other methodologies to enhance socioemotional skills.

"
LACR,Nicaragua,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The main lessons learned in 2022 were related to the evaluation of the cooperation programme 2019–2023, the evaluation of the emergency response to Hurricanes Eta and Iota, and the Real-Time Assessment (RTA) of the UNICEF support to the COVID-19 vaccine rollout in Latin America and the Caribbean region. The following lessons learned are highlighted:
·         The use of UNICEF core strengths and comparative advantages to address urgent national needs (health system strengthening, risk communication and community engagement), was recognized by stakeholders as a key partner in the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the activities supported by UNICEF were more effective when accompanied by strong, early coordination with other international development agencies. 
·         The scaling-up and replication work of the Kangaroo Families strategy has had a direct impact on the reduction of neonatal mortality, thanks to combining this strategy with the exclusive breastfeeding strategy. UNICEF needs to continue to support and ensure the full institutionalization of this strategy.
·         The coordinated response of the organizations that make up the Global Movement for Children to the emergency generated by Hurricanes Eta and Iota made it possible to carry out a rapid assessment process of children’s needs, as well as to work by taking advantage of the thematic capacity, experience and added value of the different partner organizations. This capacity must be strengthened for future emergencies.
Another lesson learned has been the importance of strengthening areas for the exchange of experiences and good practices, and the existence of areas for coordination, especially in institutions that are part of the implementation of the Protocol for Comprehensive Care for Child and Adolescent Victims of Sexual Violence. This commission detected a shortage of forensic doctors and psychologists in various territories. As a result, UNICEF partnered with the ILM to include in its workplan the resumption of the collaboration agreement between the MoH and ILM from previous years, whereby ILM will accredit the training by MoH of forensic doctors.
A noteworthy innovation in 2022 was the adaptation of the NutreMUAC smartphone application used by UNICEF in the Dominican Republic to monitor the risk of severe and moderate malnutrition in children under 5. The adaptation considers the community strategies for the detection of acute malnutrition under the framework of the Community Health and Nutrition Programme, which included the incorporation of the measurement of the mother’s arm circumference with the effective participation of MoH technical staff.
Another innovation was the involvement of religious organizations in the vaccine confidence campaigns. For the first time, UNICEF supported MoH to involve religious leaders in these processes, developing material and training the leaders. Religious leaders have a very important voice in areas with historically low routine immunization coverage and the lowest COVID-19 vaccination coverage. This innovation opens the door to involve these leaders in other campaigns such as routine immunization or dengue prevention.
In the framework of supporting inclusive education, UNICEF is developing a prototype of an accessible digital textbook, based on two units of the books, Mathematics for first grade and Knowing My World for second grade. The prototype will include technological applications that allow children and adolescents with any type of disability, as well as any learning style, to develop their learning processes through these accessible digital textbooks. The objective of this initiative is for it to be scaled-up to all books used by MoE.
The South-South cooperation has proven to be an effective mechanism for mobilizing resources and developing local capacities in quality education and inclusion. The growing interest of MoE in this cooperation modality opens up significant opportunities to increase support and technical assistance to the country. Some examples of South-South cooperation this year are the support for the implementation of the accessible digital textbook project, teacher training in relatively new subjects such as neuroscience and disability, and the transformation of teacher training colleges from the technical level to the university level. 
"
LACR,Panama,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"1.       Although Panama is a high-income country, access to quality social services for children is limited, especially in hard-to-reach rural and Indigenous areas. Social, health and education professionals working at community level are key to identify children at risk and ensure that they can access quality services. This is closely connected to the country’s efforts to increase decentralization. Therefore, UNICEF started supporting the national Government in the implementation of a model of integrated community services for children and their families, in close coordination with the communities themselves and civil society.  In 2022, 13 communities in one province and one Indigenous region were selected and committed their support to the model. The Government assigned local professionals to implement this initiative in every community. With support from UNICEF, the Government at national and subnational levels is finalizing the preparation phase to start implementation in March 2023.  

2.       A recurring constraint of the humanitarian response in the Darien Gap is guaranteeing the sustainability of interventions, such as WASH and child protection services, including through a stronger humanitarian development nexus. In 2022, UNICEF transferred a home-based alternative care model for unaccompanied and separated children and any child in need of protection to SENNIAF. The CO will be handing over the maintenance of water services to the government in 2023. UNICEF continues to encourage Government ownership and leadership to support the successful implementation of child protection and other life-saving actions for migrant and refugee children. 

3.       The last survey on UNICEF brand recognition in Panama showed that while the organization benefits from the trust of those who know it, the recognition level is fairly weak. This undermines the country office’s efforts to advocate for child rights, to raise awareness of issues related to children and to mobilize funding for the country programme. In addition, the country office has never had a sustained campaign with proven results on behaviours or social change. To respond to these challenges, UNICEF combined all its communications (advocacy, awareness-raising and social change, and fundraising) into an integrated campaign. The focus is ECD as it is one of the three priorities of the cooperation programme and it cuts across all sectors. It will run over four years and will end with a formative evaluation of its results, which are spelled out in a theory of change. 
"
LACR,Paraguay,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Relevant lessons learned focus on continuity of interventions and improvement of efficiency for programmatic implementation, communications, business engagement and advocacy.
First, promoting ownership of interventions at the local level has been critical to sustaining work on the ground. This was achieved through participatory approaches, to engage adolescents in technical teams, project development and the validation of project actions and results. UNICEF´s RCCE work with highly vulnerable populations has been crucial and needs to be contextualized to restore the population's confidence in vaccination services and primary health-care. Nonetheless, the RTA ‘Gran Chaco’ indicates that UNICEF needs to develop alliances with a diverse set of local actors particularly in regions where government presence is limited. Furthermore, availability of territorially disaggregated data is critical to understand local needs. The assessment therefore recommends UNICEF to strengthen municipal government monitoring at local level. Additionally, as highlighted by the RTA of UNICEF’s response in the Chaco Region, UNICEF continued local presence in the region was critical to build trust with local actors. Hiring local people further enhances sustainability since it contributes to strengthening local capacities.
A lesson learned has been that the CO needs to sustain a volunteer network, maintain their motivation to engage with UNICEF’s initiatives and provide ongoing training on children’s rights to develop their capacities to adequately support the interventions. In this regard, UNICEF continued mobilizing and working with volunteers for several interventions such as vaccination against Covid-19 campaigns , the Love for Learning project (ECD) and the Jere Volunteer Programme, which seeks to increase impact and a means to engage civil society. The RTA on the roll-out of the Covid-19 vaccine finds that the community work using volunteers contributed to addressing needs and increasing the demand for health services. 
Moreover, to address the mistrust from anti-rights and conservative groups towards UNICEF’s agenda, the CO identified the need of using specific language to avoid misinformation and dissipate prejudice in order to encourage joint action with local communities to carry out programmatic activities. For instance “inclusive education” was replaced by “education for children with disabilities and for children with different ways of learning”, and gender perspective “education for all children”. This has been especially important to address obstacles to the National Education Transformation process and other topics that are causing controversy in the country. However, due to the politicization of the educational policy reform and strong resistance from anti-rights groups, this process will require further technical support to the MoE and engagement with the new government in 2023.
Additionally, initiating an advocacy process towards presidential candidates and their teams will be essential to carry on UNICEF’s programmes once the new administration enters office. This will enable the CO to address the current stagnation of political processes before the elections in 2023 and avoid any interruption to UNICEF programmes due to the change of government. In recent years, the CO has learned that presidential candidates are more open to addressing childhood in their government proposals. Hence, UNICEF currently has a significant opportunity to advocate for children’s rights towards future government authorities.
Challenges are being faced to secure financial resources for the MICS in 2023. Therefore, the possibility to add selected MICS modules to national household surveys, which allow the collection and updating of information on childhood and adolescent indicators that are not collected by the National Statistics System should be considered. The CO has learned that flexibility is needed to find cost-effective alternatives to conduct MICS. 
UNICEF undertook activities on the ground to promote the cross-sectoral integration of SBC, communications and partnerships. These activities enabled UNICEF to address underlying structural barriers that hamper the promotion of children’s rights by using SBC to promote COVID-19 vaccination and breastfeeding, following the recommendations of programmatic annual reviews. One instance of this was UNICEF’s Resilient Schools model, which seeks to increase resilience to risks related to the drought in the Chaco region. 
The crises generated by the pandemic provided the opportunity to start addressing structural problems of the MoH, such as the strengthening of the cold chain system and the population´s trust towards health services and recovering the routinary immunization rates.
In terms of innovations, the CO collaborated with partners from the private sector, government and academia to scale up interventions. With respect to innovations with the private sector, the ECD centre implemented in collaboration with Grupo Las Tacuaras has been key to influencing business policies on breastfeeding and child development to advance children’s rights. This collaboration has had a significant result, since Grupo Las Tacuaras collaborated with MINNA by donating the blueprints of the ECD centre, contributing to the effective application of Law 5508, which aims to promote and protect maternity and breastfeeding. 
In terms of innovations with government institutions, collaborating with the MoH to develop digital training on child obesity has been a major innovation, since this is the MoH’s first digital training on the topic and has allowed it to reach a large number of participants. Moreover, the ‘Businesses for Children’ initiative will help UNICEF engage more enterprises, with regular financial contributions adapted to the economic context at the national level. 
Further developing ownership at the local level, improving strategies to sustain a volunteer network, developing early advocacy processes towards election candidates, utilizing alternatives to implement the MICS and articulating programmatic interventions on the ground have been critical lessons learned in 2022. Innovations for breastfeeding and childcare promotion implemented with the private sector, conducting digital training with government institutions to address children’s nutrition, and training on social protection with combined virtual and in-person modalities have proven successful to scale up the impact of the CO’s interventions. UNICEF’s approaches have enabled further progress according to strategic planning, as well as adaptation to the changing circumstances that affect programme implementation.

"
LACR,Peru,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Innovations
Technical assistance was provided to the MoH for the formulation of the ‘Technical guide for the comprehensive mental health care of children and adolescents who are victims of sexual violence’, and spaces for coordinated work have been created between the MoH and the MoE for the implementation of health promotion and CSE in educational institutions.

The close work among the Education, Public Finance for Children and Communications areas made it possible to present a very robust national and international evidence to reopen schools and address their basic conditions made UNICEF a reliable actor. To close the gender digital divide and improve the digital and Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) skills of adolescent girls, the second phase of the global Skills4girls project (in Peru, +TechGirls) has been developed, benefiting 512 adolescent girls from northern Lima. This has allowed them to present business projects and technological solutions in work simulation spaces, together with private sector companies that participated in a hackathon at the end of the programme. 

The campaign against sexual violence used an approach based on the identification of warning signs within family spaces for children and adolescents. Reflections to design this campaign were based on the evidence of social norms study around the violence determinants. The campaign involved talking about a very sensitive issue through popular language and reaching new audience segments using popular means, through a new version of a well-known song in Peru and in the language of an influencer who sings in Quechua (Cumbia and Q Pop genres). Several UNICEF friends joined this effort, such as musicians, actors, and other influencers.

Another innovative approach was the implementation of two face-to-face radio workshops for 47 community health agents from Loreto and Ucayali, who developed and recorded their voices for their messages to be disseminated through community loudspeakers to promote vaccination against COVID-19. This experience used the lessons learned from the community mobilization strategy, which the UNICEF Latin America and Caribbean Regional Office (LACRO) considered one of the 10 most successful experiences in the region in 2022.
 
The different innovations developed in 2022 will feed into the actions planned for 2023. Those that were developed in specific territories (e.g., radio workshops for community health agents) will be adapted in other territories prioritized by UNICEF. In the case of innovations developed with the national government (e.g., the 'Technical guide for the comprehensive mental health care of children and adolescents who are victims of sexual violence'), work will continue with government counterparts to ensure implementation at the national level.

Lessons learned

In terms of vaccination, the importance of having both a fixed offer at vaccination points as well as a mobile offer with vaccination brigades to improve access and reduce the existing vaccination gap was proven. One of the greatest difficulties encountered in vaccination against COVID-19 for refugee populations, migrants in transit and settled migrants is the quality of information available on side effects, which is why it is important to reinforce community communication strategies to promote vaccination, a further study will be developed in Loreto to understand better perceptions and practices.

The process of reactivating health services and intervention initiatives in non-health settings (schools) in UNICEF’s areas of intervention is facilitated by the active participation of local authorities and organized communities. The involvement of local stakeholders ensures the acceptability, sustainability, maintenance and replicability of interventions at community level. To ensure the sustainability of UNICEF’s proposed interventions, community communication strategies need to be strengthened to underline their importance and medium- and long-term impacts.

With regard to WASH, it has become evident that it is important to encourage sustainable behaviour change (for example, in open defecation and hygiene practices), as well as to strengthen the gender approach in all WASH-related activities.

In a context of political crisis and uncertainty, UNICEF has maintained a high-level dialogue with the MoE, despite the continuous change of officials. At a technical level, coordination and technical assistance have been maintained, which has allowed the agenda of inclusive education and secondary school transformation to move forward. Furthermore, the evaluation of UNICEF’s Response to the Venezuela migration crisis highlighted the development of an online registration portal for migrant children together with the MoE as a good practice. However, it has been difficult to mobilize the MoE on issues such as intercultural bilingual education or to address learning losses as a result of the pandemic. Coordination with other stakeholders should continue with Indigenous and civil society organizations to raise demands for their rights.

To influence the social policy agenda, the engagement of the UNICEF social policy team in the planning process with technical staff of the ministries and social programmes was key to identifying priorities for the provision of technical assistance and support. Based on the lessons learned identified in the Venezuela Outflow evaluation (supported by LACRO) the CBI was combined with delivery of messages on access to different services – such as, health, child protection, regularization of migratory status and COVID prevention. Although this was a positive experience, it was limited in scale in relation to the needs, according to the
 
The good performance of the global Skills4girls project has brought three more years of funds for UNICEF Peru. This has been fundamental in preparing consistent proposals in gender work, which has led to the deployment of interventions with this approach for the last five years in Peru. The recognition of this technical programmatic capacity is the reason why the country was chosen to implement the global initiative for the empowerment of girls and adolescents for 2023–2024. 
 
Using the United Nations Volunteers contract modality has changed the motivation and inclusion of the staff in UNICEF teams and in the field to implement regular and humanitarian programmes. Next year, vertical and horizontal coordination should be strengthened to ensure further progress in achieving results for children. The office has started to work in preparedness and prevention on case an emergency hits the country with several key stakeholders of the public and the private sectors.
"
LACR,Uruguay,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Continuing to lead on the agendas that adolescents have identified as priorities: mental health and climate change. In 2022, UNICEF worked more intensively than initially planned in the Country Programme of Cooperation 2021–2025, on two emerging themes: mental health and climate change. The pandemic exacerbated and highlighted the growing challenges surrounding mental health, particularly among adolescents and young people. Although the public debate initially focused on suicide rates, UNICEF brought a broader approach to psychosocial well-being and mental health, based on international evidence and experience. With regard to climate change, the drafting of the second NDC was a key opportunity to promote the incorporation of children and adolescents into environmental and climate change policies. A survey conducted by UNICEF showed that, in most cases, these groups had not previously been considered. On both themes, the Office reacted quickly to emerging opportunities and made valuable contributions.
 
Prioritizing the reduction of child poverty in 2023 and beyond. Although Uruguay’s economy recovered in 2022, official data clearly show that monetary poverty did not decrease and that, moreover, it was accompanied by a significant degree of food insecurity. Despite the expansion of social protection policies, poverty continued to be concentrated among children and adolescents. Sadly, this trend has persisted for a long time and throughout the different phases of economic cycles. It is therefore necessary to place the issue on the public agenda and, in collaboration with the government and other relevant actors, develop a new approach to help change this structural feature of Uruguayan society. Given that child poverty is particularly acute in the outlying neighbourhoods of Montevideo and in the departments bordering Brazil, UNICEF will maintain the support it currently provides to inter-institutional spaces that work on children's priorities in these territories. For example, by facilitating analyses on the situation of children and adolescents and child-centered intersectoral planning and promoting adolescent participation in these spaces.
 
Programmatic innovation with potential to accelerate results at scale for children in the region.
Through the Digital Bridges for Educational Equity initiative, funded by the UNICEF Office of Innovation, the strategic alliance with two state institutions has been strengthened: Ceibal, dedicated to innovation in education, and ANEP, in charge of implementing educational policies. This alliance supported an ambitious strategy of professional development for all teachers in the country, which was key to the widespread adoption of technologies in education. At the international level, as a result of this alliance and close coordination with UNICEF LAC regional office and headquarters, there is now an opportunity for UNICEF to form an alliance with Ceibal and the Inter-American Development Bank, thereby potentially expanding the reach of the project's results to the region. In addition, Ceibal's President played a significant part in the United Nations’ Transforming Education Summit, where one of the calls to actions was to assure “quality public digital learning for all”. There is thus an excellent platform for Ceibal's innovations and the results of the Digital Bridges for Educational Equity initiative to expand to more countries and reach more children.
 
The multiplier potential of innovation with the private sector: partnership with a business network to raise awareness about the sexual exploitation of children and adolescents.
UNICEF and the Uruguayan Tyre Dealers Union consolidated their strategic alliance. In a new phase of the alliance, to raise awareness about the sexual exploitation of children and adolescents, the No hay excusas campaign was disseminated to garages and tyre repair shops owned by union members across the entire country. In a highly male-dominated sector, workshops were implemented that sparked quality conversations with workers, raising awareness and transforming beliefs and attitudes towards this problem. In a second stage, the campaign was taken to customers and the community, while messages were amplified through materials placed in shops. This pilot experience is now being systematized and is expected to be scaled up to other unions in 2023.

LACR,Venezuela,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Strengthened coordination with authorities and partners in 2022 resulted on more effective responses to the changing context of the country, its emerging priorities and the complex needs of the most marginalized children and their families. In order to build sustainability, community engagement and participation have been pivotal in UNICEF programming and interventions in all settings, for example through the establishment of local committees (WASH, school feeding). Such engagement and participation allowed UNICEF to develop sustainable innovative solutions with the participation of affected populations, such as rainwater harvesting systems, solar-powered chlorine generators, organic gardens in schools, installation of placenta pits in healthcare facilities.
UNICEF is continuously reviewing the data-collection methods and capabilities for monitoring and evaluating, for better evidence-based programme decisions. Engaging key players throughout the implementation of the interventions led to increased data gathering in health centers, which enabled geographic prioritization and decision-making to re-direct interventions to areas with higher maternal, neonatal, and pediatric vulnerability. The efforts to analyze data at the local level have been paramount to shape local scalable initiatives; for example, a successful pilot program carried out by UNICEF for out of school children was systematized and replicated, additionally contributing to establish a space of collaboration and to nurture trustworthiness with the authorities. In addition, through digital platforms, UNICEF improved the capacities of regional warehouse staff, vaccinators and health promoters on effective vaccine management and healthcare workers as part of the COVID-19 response in Venezuela. This strategy has enabled to reach a larger number of participants, especially those located in remote areas of the country.
The response of UNICEF to the catastrophe in Las Tejer&#xED;as (Aragua state), Guajira and Catatumbo (Zulia state) has shown that partnership with education authorities potentialized results and generated multiple positive impact in the affected and highly vulnerable communities. Framing the response within the education system and its corresponding authorities at all levels enabled UNICEF to complement the rapid assessments and to ensure the delivery of principled, timely and child-centred response and advocacy. Building on this experience, UNICEF will continue to advocate and to enhance capacities to address of the psychosocial impact of natural disasters on students and teachers as key to the resumption of classes, to enable learning achievements and to develop coping mechanisms that overcome chocks in the aftermath of natural disasters.
Another important lesson deriving from the response to the catastrophe is the capacity to support relevant authorities to conduct on-site assessments, paired with the provision of immediate assistance, including pre-positioning critical emergency equipment and supplies for affected children and communities at early stages of a sudden onset emergency. These good practices will be part of the UNICEF Emergency Preparedness and Response approach in the next program cycle
Likewise, emergencies with significant and long-lasting impact on children and adolescents showed the importance to increased support to strengthen Disaster Risk Reduction, resilience building and emergency preparedness mechanisms. Disaster risks in Venezuela require a very robust and agile program to enhance preparedness and timely response articulated with the authorities. A more active, and continuous risk monitoring is required, particularly in the areas of vulnerability and prone to natural disasters.
The previous programme cycle integrated aspects of equity, human rights, diversity and gender equality at the center of programme planning and implementation. In order to implement programing that is consistent across all areas, UNICEF has started to promote a shift by identifying strategic programs that will give direction for the convergence of all goal areas of the new CPD. Converging and integrated approaches  adopted by UNICEF and implementing partners’ interventions in the most destitute communities proved to be scalable and more effective in tackling multiple and overlapping child rights deprivations, contrary to scattered projects directed to address single issues. 
UNICEF will further strengthen systemic and integrated approaches to programming to reduce inequality and overcome the bottlenecks that prevent children and adolescents from accessing their rights, based on analysis of the most pressing needs and vulnerabilities in different settings. An informed geographic prioritization will promote a more integrated, effective and efficient programming with a closer articulation between central and local levels. UNICEF will therefore adopt more hybrid and flexible models closer to the communities, in which lifesaving activities are carried out while empowering and fostering more sustainable solutions, building capacity and accountability of local stakeholders.
UNICEF has led and scaled up the Accountability for Affected Populations (AAP) methodology, currently adopted by the humanitarian community, which includes the creation of a guide for the inclusion and meaningful participation of children and adolescents with disabilities. Based on the positive feedback of the AAP approach, the mechanisms will be further developed and oriented to a more participatory approach, playing a catalytic role to articulate civil society and communities in monitoring the accountabilities of the humanitarian actors, while fostering empowerment of key local stakeholders to play a role in co-designing strategic interventions integrating their vision and action.
In 2023, highlighting the need for reducing inequalities and strengthening the social tissue, a more inclusive and equitable social protection programming is necessary and will be the backbone for long-term impact programming, as a path to address root causes of vulnerability and to promote sustainable development. UNICEF will continue to focus on robust partnership with national and local authorities, as well as enhance cooperation within public entities for capacity building, strengthen information systems and promote prioritization of children’s sensitive public policies. 
UNICEF maintains a constant dialogue and exchange with UN agencies and will continue to explore complementarities and opportunities to deliver together, based on lessons of existing initiatives and value added. The partnership strategy UN agencies and CSOs will further consolidate the risk assurance, Protection against Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, and Accountability to Affected Populations components to build even stronger systems based on the lessons learned from 2022.

"
MENAR,Algeria,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF finalized the Algeria CPD 2023–2027 in close collaboration with all sectoral partners, under the lead of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The main lessons learned from the implementation of the current CPD will inform the new CPD. While the late midterm CPD review highlighted the lack of reliable and up-to-date data and the weak culture of analysis, investments have been made in capacity-building in equity measurement and secondary data analysis for key national institutions. UNICEF will continue to strengthen national capacities in the production and systematic use of evidence-based data and analysis regarding the well-being of children and young people to enable a better understanding of the disparities in inclusive access to high-quality social services, boost advocacy and inform public policy. Strategic partnerships with academia and national line ministries, including young people in academia, have allowed the development of innovative solutions (electronic vaccination records, geolocation of child protection establishments,etc.). The continued support of such promising initiatives for the next cycle will accelerate results for children and adolescents. Another main lesson learned was the importance of gradually strengthening UNICEF’s collaboration with other United Nations entities to further accelerate synergies and deliver on children’s and young people’s rights, in line with the UNSDCF.
 
UNICEF and partners are continuously learning from the COVID-19 pandemic. In the health sector, the capacity-building workshops on cold chain and medical oxygen management triggered a great demand for additional trainings. In addition, the technical exchanges during the trainings made it possible to identify the need to develop the professions linked to cold chain and oxygen management. As a result, a reorganization of the sector is planned as well as the development of a professional accountability framework for oxygen management.
 
UNICEF continued to build upon the excellent partnership with the Ministry of Health and the lessons learned from the pandemic to further expand its health programming in the areas of evidence generation and communication for development. This resulted in a request from the Ministry for additional exploration on behavioural, cultural and religious beliefs that engender resistance towards vaccination. Listening through social media and digital platforms needs to be reinforced to improve understanding of the population’s opinion on COVID-19 and enable the provision of customized and relevant responses to questions, posts and comments generated via digital channels. 
 
On the basis of lessons learned from the first edition of N-MODA, members of the National Equity Cell actively participated in all stages of the project and helped to technically improve and validate the conceptual framework and key findings of the poverty analysis. CNESE, the core implementing institution, played an important role in this improvement. The Cell members were engaged in the discussions and reflected on the issue of translating child poverty data into concrete policy decisions. 
 
Thanks to the feasibility study of the social protection assessment, the social protection technical committee was prepared to support the assessment and committed to pursuing collaboration with CNESE and UNICEF. The quantitative assessment of the equity and efficiency of social protection was made possible thanks to the prior engagement of CNESE and the sectoral ministries. Collaboration around this project should be used to engage on programme and policy recommendations in consultation with the technical committee. 
 
In 2022, the Algeria Country Office operations section handled additional challenges and competing demands effectively in terms of procurement and logistics, owing to strengthened collaboration with the programme section. The lessons learned from the pandemic were further leveraged, resulting in improved efficiency and risk mitigation, while ensuring compliance with rules and procedures. For instance, increased upstream collaboration between the programme and supply sections, with the involvement of the Supply Division, on the definition of technical specifications allowed the rapid procurement of COVID-19 equipment, meeting the needs of the Ministry of Health. Thanks to accrued synergies between the operations and programme sections and the client-oriented approach, the Office successfully supported the Ministry to organize 15 training sessions on cold chain and oxygen systems and school health at the national and local levels for nearly 800 health and education professionals.
 
Innovations 
UNICEF continued to encourage and provide technical support for the implementation of several innovative initiatives across sectors. In the health sector, UNICEF continued to support the Ministry of Health to strengthen health information systems, a key cross-sectoral priority of the Government. The most prominent results of the collaboration with UNICEF were: (a) the ongoing digitalization of maternal mortality audits; (b) the equipping of decentralized epidemiology and preventive medicine services to strengthen their capacity to track COVID-19 contact cases; and (c) the development of the DEVAC national platform for the organization, monitoring and supervision of the child vaccination campaign, especially for recording and monitoring the vaccination of individual children, reducing immunization dropout and monitoring the implementation of the new vaccine calendar (in development).
 
Regarding public finance for children, the collaboration between CNESE, ONPPE, UNICEF and CABRI presented an innovative approach to developing the capacities of the national staff of Algerian institutions and ministries by combining South-South collaboration with the use of a digital platform. CABRI mobilized high-level officials and experts from the African countries most advanced in public finance reform implementation, including Rwanda and South Africa, to share their experiences. A digital platform enabled the participants to engage in continuous exchanges and provided access to practical budget documents and guidelines."
MENAR,Djibouti,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Dans le domaine des opérations, l’UNICEF a établi un partenariat avec l’opérateur de téléphonie Djibouti-Telecom afin d’utiliser le service de paiement électronique D-Money dans la facilitation des paiements directs aux bénéficiaires. Ce système a permis de donner un coup d’accélérateur aux programmes. Néanmoins, les limites du système se sont rapidement manifestées face aux volumes importants de fonds transitant sur la plateforme et la capacité de gestion de Djibouti-Telecom nécessaire pour y faire face, mais aussi en termes de gestion par les partenaires qui ont montré une diminution progressive dans le suivi financier des programmes. Afin d’ajuster ce dernier point, le bureau a pris la décision de sélectionner les paiements éligibles au paiement par D-Money.
L’UNICEF a continué de structurer la composante « end user monitoring ». La nécessité d’un contrôle de toute la chaine d’approvisionnement a été mise en avant afin de garantir aux enfants les meilleurs équipements possibles, particulièrement pour les enfants malnutris, tout en assurant la crédibilité des actions de l’UNICEF.  
En matière de santé et nutrition, les urgences épidémiologiques et climatiques ont perturbé la mise en œuvre des activités de routine avec comme conséquence la diminution de la couverture des interventions à haut impact sur la santé des enfants. Cette faible couverture a aggravé la vulnérabilité des enfants aux maladies évitables et entretenu le cycle des urgences. Ainsi, la réponse aux urgences devra à l’avenir aller de pair avec le maintien des activités de routine. L’absence d’un mécanisme de coordination et de planification opérationnelle a également ralenti l’exécution et le suivi des activités. 
La gestion des stocks au niveau des structures de santé est quant à elle essentielle pour assurer la disponibilité des intrants et un suivi des stocks n’est possible qu’à travers un exercice de rapportage régulier. L’instauration de réunions mensuelles de monitoring à tous les niveaux est nécessaire pour la maitrise des besoins et l’amélioration de la disponibilité des intrants. Enfin, au cours des campagnes de riposte contre la poliomyélite, il a été constaté que l’augmentation du nombre d’enfants identifiés était propositionnelle au nombre d’acteurs communautaires qui étaient résidents des villages d’intervention. Cette pratique devra perdurer pour garantir l’accès à la vaccination pour tous les enfants. 
Dans le domaine de l’accès à l’EHA, la baisse du niveau des nappes d’eau souterraines, résultat du changement climatique, occasionne le dysfonctionnement des pompes hydriques et un nombre élevé de pannes sur les forages. La mise en place d’un système de suivi des variations des niveaux d’eaux souterraines revêt un caractère essentiel pour assurer la continuité du service. Il est par ailleurs primordial de prendre en compte l’impact du changement climatique sur les communautés dans toutes les initiatives du secteur EHA, de renforcer les capacités des acteurs, et d’améliorer la connaissance sur l’impact direct et indirect du changement climatique sur les ouvrages. L'implication des jeunes dans les efforts de lutte pour la réduction de l’impact du changement climatique est elle aussi une initiative bénéfique et durable pour une réelle prise de conscience collective et le renforcement de la résilience communautaire.
Le recrutement d’une expertise technique dédiée à l’approche Assainissement Total Piloté par la Communauté a quant à elle permis de faciliter l’adhésion institutionnelle et suscité l’engouement des communautés et des autorités régionales pour sa mise en œuvre. En moins d’un an, un village a pu obtenir le statut FDAL. 
Dans le domaine de l’éducation, l’élaboration du schéma directeur du secteur de l’éducation et du plan de l’éducation et de la formation 2021-2035 a permis de mobiliser la participation des ministères et des acteurs du secteur. Dans un contexte de coordination sectorielle difficile, le processus d’élaboration du plan sectoriel de l’éducation a rencontré certaines difficultés à faire collaborer l’ensemble des partenaires, qui ne partagent pas toujours la même vision stratégique. Une des leçons apprises de ce processus est l’importance de l’appropriation de l’exercice par les parties prenantes dès son démarrage. Malgré ces difficultés, l'UNICEF a tout de même continué de renforcer avec succès le MENFOP à assumer son leadership pour promouvoir les dialogues politiques, la collaboration et la coordination avec les partenaires du secteur avec une grande flexibilité. Par ailleurs, au vu des résultats probants réalisés par l’UNICEF pour ces deux années en tant que chef de file du GLPE, l’agence a été reconduite dans son mandat de coordinatrice sectorielle et de cheffe de file.
En matière de protection de l’enfant, l’appui de l’UNICEF dans le cadre de la mise en place du système national d’enregistrement biométrique pour les faits d’états civils et le renforcement des capacités de la direction de la population avec l’octroi des tablettes pour faciliter l’enregistrement des naissances a permis aux services de se rapprocher des populations dans les localités reculées. Concernant les MGF, les études menées ont mis en lumière l’importance d’investir dans l’engagement des garçons et des hommes, qui apparaissent plus enclin à soutenir l’abandon de la pratique. L’étude sur les normes sociales et les facteurs comportementaux a aussi permis d’apprécier les différences de perceptions et d’attitudes envers les MGF entre les régions du pays renforçant l’idée qu’il est nécessaire de contextualiser régionalement les stratégies. Les activités développées pour la prévention et la réponse aux VGB dans le cadre de la réponse à l’urgence sécheresse ont représenté une opportunité pour renforcer la sensibilisation et la réponse aux MGF et montrer la nécessité de lier la lutte contre les MGF à d’autres thématiques, telles que le changement climatique, afin de l’intégrer dans d’autres secteurs et d’aborder une approche transversale.  
Afin d’assurer la durabilité des actions et un impact renforcé auprès des populations, l’UNICEF a procédé dans ses programmes à l’établissement d’accords de partenariat avec des organisations à base communautaires et des ONG locales afin de procéder à un transfert de compétences au niveau local et assurer une pleine implication des autorités régionales. Cette dynamique décentralisée sera renforcée en 2023."
MENAR,Egypt,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Evidence generation and use
UNICEF has played a key role in supporting evidence generation to inform policy, structural reforms and evidence-based planning and programming. 
UNICEF is well positioned within CAPMAS to influence national level survey to ensure that the collection of critical information on women and children fills data gaps. Efforts and investments need to continue to take advantage of upcoming opportunities, such as the national FGM Study with NCW, UNFPA and CAPMAS, and the Egypt Labour Market Panel Survey (ELMPS). Improving evidence generation and data can guide better programming for children. For instance, the policy framework and the findings from the global study on the cost of inaction provided good opportunities for high-level advocacy to advance EVAC with GoE’s agenda and for prioritization and resource mobilization. Support will continue for the development, enhancement and utilization of data from administrative systems such as the Health Information System, Case Management System, and various online applications.
Evidence generation is also key to guide policies and programming, especially when addressing sensitive topics, such as refugee community schools. To address the fragmented and limited information on refugee community schools and the available educational and learning opportunities to refugee and migrant, there is an urgent need for a collective IMS and platform that include all the information on these schools, the children and the means to support them.
 
Innovation
While the use of social media platforms can bring added benefits such as reach and accessibility, it is important to ensure that children are protected from online exploitation, abuse and harassment. UNICEF has been working with the NCW and Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT) to finalize a comprehensive programme aimed at mitigating risks to children online. The programme will be launched in 2023. GoE and UNICEF are advocating for Egypt’s membership in the WeProtect global alliance to ensure national commitment and access to resources and transnational partnerships. 
Youth engagement in the national climate change debate was enhanced with the EG Youth 4 Climate Initiative implemented in partnership with MoYS and Ministry of Environment, in establishing the first Innovation Lab Model in a Youth Center in Egypt and by engaging over 8,000 youth in the Youth Challenge focusing on skill building to promote youth led climate change solutions.
Ahead of COP27, Communications organized a WASH-related field visit with international journalists. This led to coverage outside of Egypt which can support further fundraising.
A key innovation that has proven to be very effective for children at risk and victims of violence is the use of innovative approaches to psychological rehabilitation besides counseling, such as art therapy and psychodrama sessions. In addition, the focus on shared value partnerships with companies such as Carrefour has allowed UNICEF to expand its programmatic interventions with children at risk providing them with an additional venue to support alternatives to detention through training opportunities.
UNICEF provided technical assistance to the MOHP to develop the model of climate smart green health facilities. The model has been designed and launched by the MoHP during COP27 where the Minister of Health committed to commence building the first climate smart green health facility.
 
Modelling for Scale up
To ensure a child-friendly, gender-sensitive, and well-equipped justice system, a Model Child Court in Qalyubia governorate was established with the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) as well as designated child-sensitive rooms inside child/family courts within the courthouse. These models will be nationally replicated to provide children in contact with the law with a friendly environment where children feel safe and willing to provide needed information to conduct fair trials while preventing secondary victimization.
The national scale-up of innovative learning and teachers’ capacity programming and the inclusive education model manifested national ownership yet posed significant challenge, especially against the limited conditional funding. It is therefore crucial to continue promoting evidence generation and diversify funding sources to increase enrolment rates in schools as well as strengthen protection services for children. UNICEF is planning to allocate catalytic funds to maintain its collaboration specifically with the Professional Academy of Teachers (PAT) to proceed with the scaling-up program through support from universities for a more costly efficient implementation
 
Strengthening Multisectoral Approaches, Coordination and Collaboration
Inter-sectoral coordination and collaboration are crucial to achieving better results for children. Efforts have thus been directed towards strengthening national ownership and introducing sustainable models toward strategic engagement with different governmental counterparts on the ground. UNICEF’s advocacy across education and Child Protection stakeholders, promoting synergies, and mainstreaming of CP services across sectors has contributed to fostering a coordinated national response to CP and education issues.
UNICEF has established its leadership in Early Childhood Development (ECD) during the development of the national ECD strategy and the action plan. However, sustaining the momentum requires working across health, nutrition, and education sectors, in partnership with other organizations, to scale-up priority ECD interventions nationwide, and ensure continuous high-level advocacy for ECD prioritization by the Government of Egypt and development partners.
The Takaful and Karama Program (TKP) can play a larger role to reach poor and vulnerable families with additional social services and benefits, such as child protection and behavioural change, which are critical for child development. Providing a comprehensive and integrated social protection package is essential to move beyond delivering as a stand-alone intervention for social assistance.
 

 

"
MENAR,Iran,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Innovation  
In 2022, UNICEF promoted innovation as a key strategy to deliver results for children. In partnership with the Vice Presidency for Science, Technology and Knowledge-based Economy and in collaboration with Pardis Technology Park, UNICEF launched the Second Innovation Challenge to identify, assess, and support the top innovative solutions that address the challenges faced by children and adolescents and to sensitize the broader innovation ecosystem in Iran. As a result, 29 solutions were received and reviewed carefully against pre-defined criteria and the following top three solutions were selected: 
 
CYCLOPS: Use of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms via play therapy in a Virtual Reality (VR) setting to assist the treatment of Amblyopia in children 
Robokidz: An interactive narrative-based theme park that offers children a renewed chance at edutainment using AI and robotics 
Jobzi: A mobile school that provides services to the children in street situation in Tehran 
 
UNICEF has planned a mentorship programme under which the above solutions will receive a low-interest rate loan, technical guidance, support for potential partnerships, and grants by graduation. 
 
Opportunities, Challenges and Lessons Learned 
 
Showcasing the successful implementation of a health screening programme for school children living in vulnerable areas, UNICEF Iran empowered the Ministry of Education to negotiate increasing the share of the national budget allocated to this programme for the following year. Such an achievement calls for a greater attention to evidence-based advocacy to increase impactful public expenditure on children. Hence, embedding of Public Finance for Children across programmes was introduced and adopted as a key strategy for UNICEF Iran since late 2022. 
 
To support evidence generation for an informed programme adaptation, in 2022, UNICEF initiated an evaluation of one of its adolescent wellbeing programmes with key questions around efficiency, effectiveness, relevance, sustainability, coherence, as well as child’s rights and gender considerations. In addition to UNICEF’s accountability to the affected populations and other key stakeholders, the evaluation recommendations will allow for enhancement of the programme design to be more responsive to UNICEF’s mandate as well as to the contextual, programmatic, and operational constraints in Iran.  
 
On a larger scale and given the evolving context in the country, UNICEF Iran has begun the shift towards better integration of evaluability measures when developing programmes so as to boost programme effectiveness. To this end, UNICEF Iran has identified the need for also more investment in building the capacity of partners in result-based management to enable shifting the focus from deliverables to the intended outcome and impacts of the programmes and building the evaluation culture at the national level. 
 
To carefully consider diverse types of risks imposed on the implementation and in line with principles of risk-informed programming, UNICEF has developed and maintained an updated risk assessment for Iran country office. This exercise enabled the integration of mitigation measures at both the planning and implementation phases. In addition, at the corporate level, UNICEF Iran underwent a thorough audit exercise in 2022 whose results were indicative of high levels of compliance with the applicable standards under various categories. An action plan has been developed based on the audit findings to contribute to the required improvements. 
 
UNICEF continued to ensure financial accountability based on the principles of Harmonised Approach to Cash Transfer (HACT) and under UNICEF’s leadership of the HACT inter-agency committee. This year witnessed tremendous progress with several implementing partners audited and micro-assessed on their compliance with relevant quality assurance standards and their operation and programmatic capacities, respectively. Analysis of routine spot checks also served as an appropriate foundation for conducting comprehensive refresher training for the implementing partners to increase their compliance with HACT and hence reduce the likelihood and impact of financial risks. As a lesson learned, UNICEF is incorporating HACT requirements into the programme design and financial plans of the interventions to align them with the payment modalities. 
 
In terms of supply and procurement, despite the complications created by sanctions and the economic turmoil, in 2022, UNICEF further developed its capacity to procure supplies amounting to U$5.4 million, including specialized medicine for children impacted by sanctions. This included the procurement of nebulizers for 1,104 children suffering from Cystic Fibrosis and Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) bandages for 800 children suffering from EB.  
 
Further support was given to MoHME to maintain and improve vaccine management through the provision of cold chain equipment and procurement of equipment for 19 walk-in cold rooms in thirteen provinces with refugee population. Also, as part of the contribution to the refugee response in Iran, since 2021, UNICEF procured 600,000 Measles and Rubella vaccines to support the government’s immunization campaign for children aged under 15 in thirteen provinces. 
 
Several challenges were encountered during the procurement of supplies. Sanctions have been the major bottleneck to the offshore procurement process as many suppliers refuse to either sell or ship to Iran. This has put the children at higher risk, especially when emergency or pressing needs are of concern. Nationally, higher coordination is required to facilitate smooth and agile Customs clearance to accelerate the implementation pace and hence respond to the programmatic needs timely and effectively.  "
MENAR,Iraq,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Progress towards results in 2022 demonstrated that innovations and adjustments emerging from the MTR in 2021 remain valid for the remaining two years of the Country Programme. In 2023, therefore, UNICEF will continue to organize its programmatic initiatives according to the overarching themes identified in the MTR: PF4C, digitalization, gender, climate change, humanitarian-development-peace nexus and ECD. Given the shrinking donor space, UNICEF will continue to advocate for government financing and leadership for children and young people, and build domestic technical and institutional capacity.
 
Significant innovations in 2022 laid a strong foundation for strengthened systems and equitable service delivery by government, including digitalization across sectors and innovative climate-sensitive WASH pilots for subsequent handover and scaling up by government.
 
Strong coordination mechanisms and sustained engagement led to strategic direction-setting and strengthened systems
Despite continued political instability, progress made in strengthening systems, and achieving institutional and legal reform, demonstrated the value of strong coordination to create political space and commitment to children. Both Federal Iraq and KRI established multi-sectoral coordination mechanisms and entities for child protection and progressed legal reform. UNICEF will sustain engagement, advocacy and technical support to ensure mechanisms remain functional and legislations advanced in 2022 are adopted by parliament.
 
COVID-19 and capacity gaps had limited the effective implementation of GESPs developed in 2019, as directorates of education depended on civil society initiatives and top-down federal directives. With this lesson learned, for the new GESP cycle in 2022, UNICEF strengthened government-led education coordination mechanisms to allocate funds, strengthen education leadership and enhance accountability. UNICEF is also supporting directorates to improve planning and budgeting.
 
As digitalization progresses, government coordination will become ever more important for sustainability. UNICEF will support this by having government counterparts lead selection and design of digital solutions.
 
Bundled and integrated services, and cross-sectoral approaches, accelerated results for children and young people
Led and designed by MOH with UNICEF support, bundled outreach services provided lifesaving services and potential paths toward universal health coverage. Integrated vaccination services and SBC leveraged COVID-19 resources to reach over 134,000 zero-dose children with RI. Integrating cold chain and the broader supply chain contributed to infrastructure, operational budgeting, and equipment to benefit immunization systems in the long term.
 
Cross-sectoral collaborations created opportunities to advocate for strategic approaches to child-centred care and services. MHPSS services for children and adolescents were delivered through both schools and primary healthcare centres, with referral pathways for advanced support. Adolescents, especially girls, were empowered through gender-sensitive and inclusive teacher training on LSCE. With funding for ordnance risk education decreasing, UNICEF supported an innovative delivery modality, in which schoolteachers were trained to deliver awareness-raising messages to students, and youth groups to deliver messages to their peers. UNICEF work with vulnerable children affected by explosive remnants of war in Iraq was featured by the organization globally to advocate for the end of Explosive Weapons in Populated Areas, in support of an international declaration led by Ireland.
 
Cross-sectoral linkages contributed to 64,900 vulnerable children returning to learning, climate-resilient WASH in schools and healthcare facilities, with sustainable solar power in schools, and the finalization of the cross-sectoral ECD strategy. The mainstreaming of young people’s engagement across all programmes was further expanded in 2022.
 
Innovative approaches, cost-sharing and leveraged partnerships expanded the reach of UNICEF interventions despite funding constraints
Blended WASH financing presented opportunities to address funding gaps. For instance, UNICEF implemented the sub-zoning programme in Basra with financial contributions from an energy company which significantly accelerated results for children in the water sector, while MoCHPM financed digital water meters in 15 Iraqi governorates, complementing UNICEF interventions. However, expanding this approach will require development of finance mechanisms and systematic identification of WASH business needs.
 
Cost-sharing with communities sensitized through SBM supported EMIS rollout. In SBM schools, communities provided laptops while UNICEF trained teachers to enter EMIS data. Passed-on learning also expanded the reach of UNICEF e-pedagogy capacity building by including more teachers in the same schools.
 
While 553 schools implemented SBM through school block grants from UNICEF, 351 “guest” schools sharing same premises and 427 additional schools developed learning improvement plans and exercised administrative and financial authorities through capacity building.
 
UNICEF explored service-based approaches to ECE provision (in homes, schools and communities) as alternatives to expensive facility-based services. Through investment cases and cost-benefit analyses allied with demand generation, UNICEF successfully advocated for alternative models which sensitized communities to demand services.
 
Evidence, data generation and mainstreaming gender should be prioritized
Lack of reliable, up-to-date data constrained advocacy with donors and governments, reduced motivation to address challenges to children, and prevented robust assessments of progress. Evidence produced through small, well-designed studies created interest amongst government counterparts, pointing to an avenue towards evidence-based health sector policy development. However, periodic surveys remain the most reliable data generation method and a new MICS exercise is planned for 2023.
 
The success of UNICEF’s data-driven SBC interventions was predicated on six research studies and course corrections informed by regular data collection. Data collected via online surveys, Talkwalker, KOBO and U-Report were recorded and analysed on various platforms, such as the rumour tracking dashboard and the behavioural tracker. These enabled UNICEF and partners to understand drivers of behaviour, devise targeted interventions and reach 86 per cent of Iraq’s population with messages on sustainable behaviour change to protect oneself against COVID-19.
 
Lack of data on young people specifically posed persisting challenges to integrating their concerns in policy development. In 2022, UNICEF developed a policy brief on youth engagement in decision-making processes and will coordinate with UN and governmental partners on upstream work, with a particular emphasis on generating further national data on young people.
 
Adolescent girls face particular challenges in terms of protection, GBV and access to education and meaningful work. While steps were taken in 2022, e.g. through GBV training for healthworkers, issues such as child marriage require further attention. Investment in mainstreaming gender across programmes will be accelerated in 2023, including cross-sectoral integrated programming with development partners taking adolescent girls as a focus.
"
MENAR,Jordan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF collaborated with government agencies in Jordan to implement health and nutrition programmes but faced challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite these challenges, UNICEF was able to develop a digital health information system, the first of its kind in Jordan, for primary health care and rolled it out in pilot facilities in 2022. Transitioning to a system-strengthening approach, UNICEF focused on emphasizing the importance of investment in development and humanitarian efforts to aid vulnerable children and women in Jordan. UNICEF has also ensured that health services are gender-responsive and accessible to all and has emphasized the importance of gender equity analysis to understand any disparities in access to services between young girls and boys.
The national diagnostic assessment (NDA) supported by UNICEF has provided the MoE with national results across grades 4 to 11 to analyze lost learning and target remedial efforts. This is one of the first such assessments post-COVID-19 globally providing real-time data for teachers. The results are being analyzed in terms of gender, status and location and are supporting MoE and UNICEF to target efforts to reduce education inequalities. UNICEF continued to support online blended teacher professional development – a recent innovation for Jordan, raising the quality of in-service teacher training. In 2022, this has included online e-safety, training for the NDA, as well as awareness of national teacher professional standards. An assessment of Learning Bridges (UNICEF, 2022) found that the program strengthened teacher skills in blended learning and the use of technology, as well as overall teacher pedagogy. This has helped teachers to improve their teaching practice and support children’s’ learning recovery.
 
In order to make UNICEF's programmes more comprehensive and effective, the Adolescent and Youth team identified the need to improve collaboration and knowledge sharing between implementing partners and to strengthen referral pathways between interventions. One lesson relates to the approach adopted by UNICEF to facilitate the transition of the Life Skills Programme to the MoY, through a gradual and strategic approach and by embedding a sustainability vision into programme design and implementation from the very beginning. This vision entailed an understanding that such a transition would only be achieved over a long-term period, step-by-step, and building on gradual achievements, existing structures and systems. Through a flexible and accommodating approach, UNICEF found a collaboration and delivery model that suited MoY needs, and that involved comprehensive capacity building (covering curriculum content, financial management, monitoring and evaluation, reporting, communication) and cost-sharing arrangements. 
Another lesson relates to the innovative nature of the Nahno platform, a scalable solution to drive youth volunteerism and engagement which was highlighted as a proof of concept for the UNICEF Learning to Act initiative and replicated in two other countries in MENA. 
UNICEF Adolescent and Youth team also started working in an innovative way to fundraise, with the Education Outcome Fund to launch an Outcome-Based Fund in the skills-for-employment sector in Jordan. This funding model aimed to improve the placement and retention outcomes of vocational and digital skills training, by providing training providers with incentives to deliver effective training and by targeting the most vulnerable young people. 
In 2022, UNICEF continued its coordinated efforts to align the humanitarian WASH sector activities within the larger development agenda. However, challenges such as the need for a transition in service delivery in refugee camps, as well as the overall availability of water continued to impact the delivery of WASH services. 
As per its renewed engagement in evidence generation, UNICEF WASH section completed and launched the study “Tapped Out - The costs of water stress in Jordan” in collaboration with the Ministry of Water and Irrigation and in partnership with The Economist Impact. This was an innovative partnership. The study aimed to ignite a deeper discussion among policy makers and the international donor community on the unfolding crisis of water scarcity in Jordan as well as the socio-economic impacts across sectors and vulnerable people in Jordan.
With respect to social protection, UNICEF has learned lessons including the importance of having a unified policy framework for the social protection sector (NSPS), which is crucial in maximizing synergies and ensuring integrated approaches across different areas of the social policy system. This includes strengthening institutional arrangements and supporting operationalization mechanisms at both the national and community levels, as well as implementing activities and sector-wide policy priorities under the NSPS.
Effective social protection and policy programming relies on strong partnerships and interventions at various stages of the policy/service delivery cycle, including: gender-responsive social protection policies and sector strategies, system strengthening and institutional capacity building, provision of social policy programmes with enhanced linkages to the national system, support for the development-humanitarian nexus, social budgeting and public financing for children (PF4C), and evidence generation for national-level data.
Investment in digital technologies and integrated databases/systems is essential for sector integration, improved targeting, and overall increased coverage and inclusiveness. This includes digitization, MIS, and the continued engagement and contributions to key areas at the national level, with a focus on transferring innovations from humanitarian responses to the national systems.
Generating updated and timely evidence and socio-economic assessments through partnerships with government, UN and IFIs is important for informing responses and programming, particularly considering the delays and time span associated with national statistics/surveys. This includes developing programme components related to graduation and economic inclusion of youth and females, as well as a dedicated component for PF4C and social protection/financing issues.
As the Jordan Country Office embarks on its new CPD, systematic efforts will be made to strengthen an equity framing, including a strong gendered lens, across sectoral work and institutionally. JCO will build on the gender roadmap and institutional priorities to ensure gender equitable results and workplace.

MENAR,Lebanon,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Following the multiple, overlapping crises in recent years that have struck Lebanon and impacted both the refugee and host community populations, in 2022 UNICEF shifted its approach from nationality-based towards a vulnerability-based approach to reach the most marginalized people. While previously the bulk of UNICEF’s work focused on the Syrian refugee response, based on the current needs, the rapidly deteriorating context, and the overall level of vulnerability in the country, UNICEF is expanding its scope of work to include all vulnerable children.  
Due to the challenging economic context which included a drastic drop in the value of the Lebanese Pound, and based on lessons learned, in 2021 UNICEF shifted to working in US Dollars only. In 2022, UNICEF, UNHCR, and WFP co-chaired a new group for coordinating on all cash programmes in Lebanon, known as the Cash Working Group (CWG). The CWG achieved a complete mapping of all cash programmes in the country, including a focus on the various objectives, target groups, modalities and currencies that are used (LBP or USD) as well as the transfer modality used. The evaluation found that the UNICEF Haddi Child Grant presented a positive example of having shifted both to USD and to cash-over-counter using money transfer agents. 
In response to the increasingly complex and challenging environment and building off lessons learned from the last five years of education programming, UNICEF is adapting its programming towards a multiple flexible pathways approach, under its TREF programme. Following an assessment of its Nonformal Education (NFE) programming, UNICEF found that children had a low rate of transition from NFE to formal education. UNICEF also found critical gaps in service delivery across Lebanon which included challenges facing families trying to access services, as different services are offered in different locations. In some cases, the cost of transport did not allow families or children to pursue services. UNICEF found it challenging to reach the most vulnerable children in informal settlements, where mobile services are available but not continuously. UNICEF also found that the current way of operating did not demonstrate strong value for money, as each partner had different costs depending on the location and services offered. Transitioning from NFE to formal education also proved costly, despite the low success rate. 
Building off these findings, UNICEF adapted its approach to support out of school children through a multiple flexible pathways approach which offers quality learning opportunities to out-of-school and out-of-learning children through retention and catch-up programmes and other learning programmes to either retain children in schools or attract them back to education. Under this approach, UNICEF is piloting two innovative programmes: 
1.     The School Bridging Programme (SBP) ‘Dirassa’ programme, which aims to increase the number of children in school and learning, but also leverages extra resources to support private schools. Under this programme, UNICEF is supporting MEHE to help children transition from NFE programs to formal education, learning in a more amenable educational setting, or participate in youth programmes. 
2.     The Multi-Service Community Center (MSCC) ‘Makani’ approach, which builds on lessons learnt from the past decade of NFE and child protection programming to reach highly marginalized children in a safe and protected environment through an integrated package of services, providing a higher quality of services for children and their caregivers, with a more sustainable and accessible approach. 
This programme was designed in 2022 based on lessons learned and will be launched in 2023. The ‘Dirassa’ programme enables out-of-school children aged from 8 to 12 to re-enter, catch-up, and transition into formal or non-formal education. MSCCs, or Makani centers, will support out-of-school marginalized children and their families and communities access multiple services, including education, child protection, adolescent and youth engagement, social assistance, and health and nutrition services with referrals to additional specialized services as needed. Both pathways will ensure children continue to learn and will contribute to greater social cohesion, while providing a protective environment for all children.
UNICEF has been implementing the Haddi integrated child grant across Lebanon for a year and a half. Haddi is unique because it is a cash grant that offers access to a holistic set of services. To deliver social assistance, UNICEF took into account the current economic crisis and switched to using private sector money transfer agencies to disburse cash, rather than the banking system due to Lebanon’s financial collapse. This year, UNICEF conducted an impact evaluation which demonstrated that Haddi families are especially vulnerable and that the grant is having a strong impact on protecting these families from the economic crisis. The evaluation demonstrated the positive impact Haddi had on children’s lives including improved food security, spending on basic services, and support and care. Haddi is helping to cushion the impact of the crisis on the most vulnerable households, including having significant positive impacts on total household expenditure, specifically on education and clothing for children. Haddi households spent on average LBP 73,000 more per person per month compared to what they would have been expected to spend in the absence of Haddi. In terms of individual expenses, there was an increase in LBP 15,000 on education expenses related to snacks or transportation (during a period when schools were closed). Additionally, Haddi households were 20% less likely to borrow money to meet their consumption need, compared to households not receiving Haddi. Compared to similarly vulnerable households, Haddi beneficiaries are less likely to resort to negative coping strategies as a result of participating in the programme. Haddi recipients were around 14% less likely to either reduce the size of the meals or the number of meals, due to a shortage of food or money to buy food. Haddi recipients were also more likely to restrict consumption of adults so that the children can eat. UNICEF HQ is now reviewing Haddi as an example of best practices globally. "
MENAR,Libya,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"One of the main lessons of 2022 for UNICEF Libya, was the importance of strengthening integrated service delivery and promoting linkages between health, education, child protection and social protection services. A key reason why the most vulnerable children are being left behind is that they often face compounding drivers of poverty, experiencing multiple deprivations that further exacerbate poverty and cannot be addressed by a single programme. And from the viewpoint of the population, the delivery of social services is often disjointed and uncoordinated at a local level. To tackle this, UNICEF further advanced the Baity centres to provide a range of integrated and efficient services to children and families. Through the Baity centres, UNICEF continued to provide education opportunities, psychosocial support/protection and skills to vulnerable Libyans and non-Libyans, including children on the move, advocating to enroll the latter ones in the formal education system. Next steps will be: the determination of a minimum service package of Baity centres and setting harmonized standards of care for all partners; scaling up services with Government; strengthening the monitoring and outreach. 

Also, UNICEF collaborated with the Primary Health Care Institute (PHCI) to increase inclusive and equitable access to basic services for Libyan and non-Libyans, by scaling up mobile health/nutrition teams in Baity centres for the provision of micronutrient supplementation, immunization services and optimal infant and young child feeding (IYCF) promotion.  

Over the last year, programmes have highlighted the benefits of data-driven approaches for decision making and advocacy. UNICEF strengthened its health information system for evidence-based advocacy and promotion of Primary Health Care for Universal Health Coverage, contributing to national and global maternal, neonatal and child health targets. With national stakeholders, UNICEF continued to support the operationalization of the District Health Information System (DHIS2) in 700 health facilities, putting emphasis on health facility-based reporting after training of staff and provision of data collection tools. Review of DHIS revealed Benghazi as the model for successful implementation of DHIS and started reporting on key indicators.   In addition, UNICEF conducted the first-ever Nutrition Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) Nutrition survey to ascertain the nutrition status of Children, Pregnant and lactating Women to design evidence-based nutrition interventions. Also, as part of efforts to strengthen administrative data in the education sector for enhanced decision making at the national and sub-national levels, UNICEF supported the roll-out of the Education Management Information System (EMIS), which will be scaled in 2023. In 2022, UNICEF in partnership with the BSC also launched the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) which will collect internationally comparable estimates of key indicators that to assess the situation of children and women. Further, to plan data-based activities that address looming data gaps, UNICEF developed a Data Action Plan which maps data activities proposed for 2023. All these efforts around data enhancement will also be key to improve targeting to the most neglected municipalities and groups. UNICEF is also developing its advocacy action plan based on new data and the Committee of the Rights of the Child latest recommendations. 

Increasing programme focus and fundraising to southern areas also emerged as a key priority for the new country programme. Leveraging data from municipalities and increasing field missions will be crucial factors to develop an area-based programme with a social cohesion lens.  

This year also saw the effective integration of Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) across UNICEF various programmes. In 2022, UNICEF Libya has built its capacity to enhance community participation recognizing the importance of empowering communities, while engaging fully and holistically with them. Mainstreaming AAP activities in Libya included developing the first country office AAP strategy and associated action plan. Also, as part of the AAP activities in 2022, UNICEF Libya joined the common UN Community Feedback Mechanism (CFM) which effectively allowed affected populations to obtain information on UNICEF programmes, provide feedback and address complaints, including sexual exploitation and abuse. UNICEF also prioritized beneficiary participation through studies such as the ‘Beneficiary Assessment of Baity Centres’ which used direct interactions with beneficiaries to obtain feedback and inform programmatic changes. In collaboration with the National Center for Disease Control, UNICEF worked on developing a national strategy for Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) to ensure integrated communication across Health, WASH and Education sectors. 

Last year highlighted the importance of leveraging partnerships to support the bridge from service delivery to systems strengthening. Programme teams developed strong relationships with Government counterparts in preparation for the transition from humanitarian focus to system strengthening approach within the new Country Programme (2023-2025). In this regard, UNICEF made substantial progress this year in building the foundations of system strengthening with the Ministry of Education (MoE). Key relationships have now been built, enabling UNICEF to scale up support to the system-strengthening interventions including improving the education sector enabling environment, teacher professional learning, curriculum development and child-friendly learning environments. Internal coordination remains a challenge within the MoE and much time and effort are needed with the line Ministries for interventions to succeed. 

Concerning funding, as in previous years, the Country Office continues to rely heavily on the European Union and Germany, the top two donors of the office. This highlights the critical need to maintain and sustain these relationships, but also the need to diversify the office’s donor base through engaging with new donors and the private sector. In 2023, the office will also continue its advocacy efforts for the Libyan Government to increase domestic resources for essential social services, with particular focus on nutrition, primary health care, water, education infrastructure and social protection.

MENAR,"MENARO, Jordan",Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Partnership within and outside the region
Given the great diversity of programmes in the region, a strategic approach to partnerships is required to leverage the influence of partners and donors and mobilize resources.
MENA continues to be highly strategic for governments in the neighbourhood and abroad. Its geo-political position allows COs in the region to have strategic conversation with Embassies, IFIs and other multilateral actors around child rights issues and humanitarian action.
This year UNICEF continued to seek and build partnerships both outside and within the region. Within MENA and given the effective presence of UNICEF in several High-Income countries in the region, we worked to get more support from the private sector in the Gulf. Those strategic partnerships had an impact that went beyond the borders of the region, and into Africa and Latin America (some examples are EAA/Educate a Child based in Qatar, DP World, Al Ghurair Fund based in Dubai, and the Crown Prince Court in Saudi Arabia).  The challenge lies in the prioritization of the different private sector engagement opportunities, given the limited resources at the regional and country levels. A stronger focus for innovative integrated (private and public sector) country approaches for resource mobilization will further enhance value-based partnership with private sector. 
Challenges related to donor conditionalities continued during 2022, especially in certain countries. A more consistent, intentional and strategic approach to risk management is required to develop solutions for the major donor-related risks identified: excessive reporting requirements, restrictions on use of funding and increasing requirements related to risk-management, environmental and social safeguards and donor visibility.
 
Climate change and water scarcity in the region 
The issue of transboundary ground and surface waters caused by the lack of clear treaties and monitoring systems is beyond UNICEF’s mandate. However, UNICEF must continue to assess and manage this risk and its advocacy with other UN agencies and government counterparts stressing the importance of access to clean water for child health and development. UNICEF must also continue to support water management policies at national level. 
UNICEF has laid a solid first step regarding the accelerator on climate change and water scarcity programming through the roll out of Climate Landscape Analysis for Children across the region and has advanced on engagement of youth on climate with huge success. UNICEF has established strategic alliances with key regional organisations including the Arab league and the UNESCWA enabling us to advance the child-focused agenda on climate including active participation in the COP processes.  
Climate finance is often complicated, especially with accredited entities of the major multilateral climate funds. Thus, UNICEF globally, needs to accelerate efforts to become accredited with the Global Climate Fund and African Climate Change Fund and hire staff with climate finance experience and expertise in applying for multilateral funds.
The importance of transition from learning to earning 
Youth unemployment is of great concern to governments in the region, imposing social cohesion risks which are already high in MENA. Addressing this issue requires multi-sectoral action on both sides of the labour market (building human capital and creation of employment and entrepreneurship opportunities), accompanied by actions that help young people make the transition from learning to decent work. Partnerships with other UN agencies, governments, the private sector and young people is the most holistic and effective way to address these challenges and a valuable entry point for leading the way on integrated UN work at the programmatic level. 
Addressing public health emergencies 
The region experienced eight public health emergencies highlighting the need to focus on addressing multiple health threats through strengthening primary health care systems including focus on prevention, preparedness, detection, response and community-based approaches. Leveraging experiences and resources from COVID-19, ensuring resilient systems, including the use of behavioural data and community systems are not only essential for protecting the health of most vulnerable groups, but also for mitigating against the devastating consequences of outbreaks on children. Furthermore, health systems need to be linked to determinants of health such as the economy, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), nutrition and education. 
Coordinated nutrition response in the region 
Programming and response must address the region’s diverse context, ranging from hotspot countries with high undernutrition (Djibouti, Lebanon, Sudan, Syria, Yemen) to more affluent countries with rising overweight and obesity. Strengthening partnerships and coordination with other UN agencies (WHO, FAO and the UN World Food Programme) which we are pursuing is critical to supporting an effective, coordinated nutrition response in countries. The role of government in spearheading action on all forms of malnutrition is essential.    
Prioritization and focus on strategic investment  in data
A wide range of data initiatives are taking place globally and within MENA; one lesson learned in 2022 was the need to prioritize, focusing on strategic investments that reflect UNICEF’s comparative advantage. MENARO is rolling out country-level ‘Light data action planning’ to complement more in-depth data diagnostics, drawing on lessons from its support for research and the need for accountability and progress monitoring. This should improve coordination among different programme sections and their country-level partners on data work that spans across sectors, helping to mobilize regional and HQ support. 
Early learning and digital education platforms
Fundraising for  early childhood development and early learning is challenging.  This stimulated a search for alternative modalities, such as results-based financing, to expand pre-primary education. Morocco and Tunisia are part of the global ‘Five million futures’ initiative led by HQ, aiming to contribute to increasing school readiness opportunities. 
Integrated packages are critical to supporting early childhood development and education and it is essential to adapt them to socio-cultural contexts. However, this requires time and investment in human and financial resources, including active engagement with the government authorities. to ensure continuity and sustainability. 
UNICEF will continue to manage the risk of disruption of education due to insecurity, political instability, and health outbreaks (among other factors) which requires exploring viable alternatives: including digital platforms, use of low-cost, low-tech remote or hybrid solutions to ensure learning continuity, especially for the most marginalized children. 

"
MENAR,Morocco,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"During the reporting year, UNICEF Morocco noted several lessons that will influence the implementation of the next programme cycle.
 
The value of engaging both at national level and select sub-regional levels. For example, in education, UNICEF worked at central level to help develop models to address service gaps and challenges (inclusion, early childhood, disabilities and others).  The incremental process of gathering good practice, engaging with stakeholders, developing programming models in select regions, generating evidence and then working with central actors for national scale-up proved effective.  Having validated this approach with four regions, UNICEF will introduce two additional regions to address upcoming priorities of ensuring retention of adolescent girls into school, with greater emphasis on multi-sector responses linking to health, child and social protection. It will develop programmes of work with Beni Mellal Khenifra and Fes Meknes, a selection informed by the national education reform, the gender development index, dropout rates, the national human development index, and the local programmatic environment. 

The policy framework for child protection is robust however gaps remain around migrant children and select pockets of children (those affected by the lack of consistent local services, children in institutions, children in a child marriage, children at risk of abandonment, and others). This was confirmed in the 2022 visit by the Special Representative on Violence Against Children, Najat Maalla M'jid.  The child protection programme has used a mixed strategy to address this gap, working collectively with NGO partners, line ministries, foundations, and constitutional entities to advocate for strengthened policies and programmes. It also partnered with NGOs and local authorities to ensure a minimum of services reach the most vulnerable children. After years of advocacy, evidence generation, and political engagement at the highest levels, there is important progress in the prevention of child marriage. Similarly, advances have been made on alternatives to detention for children and the coordination between local authorities and NGOs in service provision for migrant children.  UNICEF and partners will use lessons from these experiences for the operationalization of the localized child protection systems (DTIPE) to ensure more standardized case management for children. And, it will accompany the ministry of solidarity in its objective to strengthen the family as a key sphere of child protection, with a focus on prevention and care. This will require new strategies in social and behavior change communication as well as linkages with national programmes such as the upcoming family allowance programme for 2023/4. 

Work in social behavior change programming and communication has matured post COVID-19. Morocco hosted the global social behavior change communication summit in 2022. During the opening, both the ministers of health and of solidarity, spoke to the critical role social behavior change communication is playing and will increasingly play in public policy. Programming in COVID-19, child protection, and other sectors have resulted in SBCC strategies being considered critical to achieving all programme results. 

Adolescent participation can meaningfully strengthen country office programming. The country office partnered closely with adolescents this year, from engaging in regional and global events, to partnering with adolescents to take on topical advocacy campaigns to working with its adolescent advisory group in day-to-day programming. The country office will work with the advisory group to continue to intensify its role and contribution within the new country programme.

WASH and climate change programming must be expanded. Annual reviews with education and health partners both raised the need for technical support in WASH and water sensitive programming. An assessment conducted in over 1,000 health facilities and select education facilities as well as the Climate Landscape Analysis for Children process underway will inform next steps in view of the impact of drought and persistent water scarcity.

South-south cooperation must be enhanced in all programme streams. Morocco’s south-south cooperation agenda is foremost in its foreign policy and engagement. And while UNICEF in Morocco has contributed in meaningful ways to this agenda, more can be done to leverage UNICEF’s global presence, country office footprint, and recognized expertise to both share Morocco’s promising milestones in development as well as to provide relevant country examples and experiences to sharpen existing programming where relevant.

Multisector gender programming will be necessary to achieve programme results.  UNICEF has mobilized resources to respond to the inequities facing adolescent girls, and to do so in multi-sector way. Given the centrality of gender-specific results in the new country programme, the country office will need to develop clear monitoring strategies for pursuing and monitoring this area of work.
 
In 2023, the country office will focus on developing an innovation strategy that will help to drive programme results and respond to the growing interest by national partners.
"
MENAR,Oman,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Co-ordination of activities
The PMG met once mid-year to discuss activities planned under the RWP, which was ultimately signed in early January 2023. Continuing strong partnerships with line ministries and Tawazun complemented PMG engagement and offered a way to coordinate the programme across ministries.
 
A separate lesson to have emerged this year is the importance of UNICEF “speaking the same language” as government counterparts. For example, Oman’s Ministry of Finance prefers certain words and phrases – for example the use of the term “public finance management” (PFM) as opposed to “public finance for children” (PF4C), which is more commonly used by UNICEF.  Ministry officials favour “PFM” because they believe it to be a less narrow term and not specific to one age demographic. UNICEF sensitivity to this was important for retaining the ministry’s cooperation – keeping in mind that, ultimately, a strong and trusted partnership with the Ministry of Finance facilitated timely access to required data.  
 
E-discussion 
A major challenge was securing the participation of young people in the online discussion to inform the Situation Analysis on Adolescents and Youth. The target of 1,000 participants was widely missed with only 153 young people signing up to comment – this is despite 19,000 visitors to the site. Key takeaways were that the discussion format was overly complex and there were concerns about anonymity. Feedback suggested that young people would be more likely to participate if the survey was multiple choice, rather than open-ended questions. For any future survey, UNICEF must also consider how to better reassure participants of confidentiality. 
Capacity Building 
Deploying an embedded economist to work with the ministries of finance, health and education in the PFM work proved useful in that it allowed the consultant to provide on-the-job knowledge transfer, training, and capacity building. The economist’s presence was also instrumental in improving dialogue and understanding between the three entities.   
 
Embarking on the nutrition monitoring work this year, one lesson to quickly emerge is that improving the administrative data system requires not only looking at the quality and availability of data, but also improving the capacity of the people and teams who generate and use the data.    
 
The incorporation of the case management system within the social protection system also requires capacity building of the social workforce. UNICEF has initiated discussions with technical teams from the ministries of education, health, and social development to enhance the quality of the social workforce. A few separate initiatives, such as mental health and case management training, have taken place. However, high-level advocacy is required to introduce an accreditation programme for social workers and a comprehensive review of their mandate across the three ministries.

"
MENAR,"Palestine, State of",Lessons Learned and Innovations,"     
In  2022, UNICEF promoted and strengthened the interaction between evidence  generators and evidence users, helping to increase evidence-use in policy and  practice. Following a growing interest from the Palestinian Authority in  developing nationally adapted child poverty measurements, UNICEF worked with  National Poverty Task Force to define the dimensions of child multi-dimension  poverty which the Task Force members requested to also integrate a child  monetary poverty dimension, to be collected through the Palestinian  Expenditure and Consumption Survey (PECS) planned for 2023-2024. While this  is a first step in the process, it constitutes a major advancement in  possibly gearing the discussions between various stakeholders at the national  level (PCBS and line ministries) about how the national household and child  multi-dimensional poverty data will be used/ applied in national planning  processes. The concept suggested is to use monetary poverty to define cash  interventions, while multi-dimensional poverty will be used to determine  needs for provision of other complementary services. 
   
  As part of its engagement to prioritize Climate Change in the new APD and  considering the impact of Climate Change in the State of Palestine, UNICEF  conducted a Climate Landscape Analysis for Children (CLAC) analysing climate  change trends, and their impact on children, as well as providing a set of  recommendations to support the mainstreaming of climate change into UNICEF  programmes. The generation of evidence in this newer thematic area for which  limited analysis is available nationally has triggered a wider interest both  with line ministries and technical and financial partners. As a result,  UNICEF was able to provide, prior the COP-27, advocacy messages to PWA and  EQA as well as members of the Palestinian delegation. Advocacy messages  included a child-centred lens around the impact of climate change, and to  adopt climate-resilient WASH services in SoP such as transitioning to  solar-powered water systems, prioritizing effective water management and  initiating discussions around the integration of climate change in schools  with the EQA and MoE. Furthermore, a Readiness Proposal for the Green Climate  Fund was successfully presented to strengthen PWA information management,  planning and programming frameworks towards the climate action agenda and  projected impacts on the WASH sector, while opportunities for collaboration  between UNICEF and other partners, including new ones, are being developed.
   
  In 2022, UNICEF continued to invest in system strengthening across the State  of Palestine engaging and advocating for dialogue and collaboration between  the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in order to ensure harmonization and  standardization of policies, protocols and services for children.
  As mentioned in the mid-term evaluation of the joint UNICEF, UNFPA, WHO  programme on child and maternal health, UNICEF successfully leveraged its  work on the ground in the Gaza Strip to advocate at the national level for an  update of existing national technical guides/protocols and/or introduce new  ones. UNICEF supported rounds of technical consultations with health  professionals both at national and subnational level and as a result, four  protocols (on PCC; adolescent job aid; neonate care and sexual and reproductive  health (SRH) were endorsed at national and subnational levels, while the  first national WASH standards to be implemented in health facilities were  developed. 
   
  In the area of justice, UNICEF played an instrumental role in  institutionalizing mediation at the Attorney General Office as an alternative  measure of detention. The success of this institutionalization is a result of  cumulative efforts that UNICEF has played over the years through supporting  the drafting of mediation guidelines and supporting the trainings of  community mediators. A great illustration of these efforts is this year’s  numbers where 75 per cent of child cases were resolved through mediation. To  ensure that all children are offered child-friendly channels and alternatives  to detention, UNICEF is building its efforts with different governmental  partners to introduce this module in the Gaza Strip, despite operating in a  different legal framework. The introduction comes as an essential step into  harmonizing best practices across all Palestinian governorates and ensuring  the best interest of every child.
   
  In the education section, as an innovative approach together with MOE, UNICEF  proposed science, technology, engineering and  mathematics (STEM)  activities as part of the summer activities for older  school-aged children both in the Gaza Strip and in the West Bank. The  inclusion of STEM activities contributed to the development of the national  STEM strategy. Additionally, the engagement of education authorities both at  national and subnational  levels led to a higher coverage of school-aged  children, including in  vulnerable communities.
  
 
  
As  part of the scale up plan for the Complaints and Feedback Mechanism (CFM)for  the Prevention of Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (PSEA) and Accountability to  Affected Population (AAP), UNICEF joined the global SPARK innovation  initiative to further develop the existing platform and include a component  on feedback channels for end-user supply monitoring, the first of its kind.  This will allow to share the feedback with local suppliers on the  supplies/commodities provided to children affected by humanitarian crisis.  This initiative is expected to potentially reach 48,000 children across the  State of Palestine.

MENAR,Saudi Arabia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
·         High quality technical expertise and investment in strengthening strategic partnerships with lead Governmental partners is key to building trust with the Governments of the Gulf Countries and influencing issues that maybe considered sensitive such as child protection and data. Aligning UNICEF’s areas of influence with Government’s national priorities and visions is instrumental to advance these partnerships; 
·         Interactions between Gulf partners and UNICEF senior management remain critical to securing high-value, high-visibility strategic partnerships both at the domestic and global level. This was evident in the Global Government Summit 2022 in UAE, Global Cybersecurity Forum in KSA and during the FIFA World Cup in Qatar. A number of new opportunities will be offered in 2023 including the Third Riyadh International Humanitarian Forum in KSA and the COP28 in UAE;
·         The scope to expand private sector partnerships across the Gulf is considerable, especially with members of the UN Global Compact. In order to develop such partnerships, GAO will need to revise its’ strategy to ensure the optimal allocation of limited human resources required to manage the partnerships, focusing much more on high-value opportunities at both the domestic and global level.  At the domestic level, public private partnerships in advancing children’s rights agenda are expanding with many successful examples of collaboration in 2022 in the area of social and behavioral change campaigns in early childhood development and child protection; 
·         Providing high level technical expertise and offering knowledge exchange platforms for the Gulf Countries at regional and global level to show case good practices from their countries are two key strategies to advancing partnerships in the Gulf and positioning UNICEF’s brand as a knowledge-broker, reliable and a partner of choice for GAO governments; 
·         UNICEF’s flexibility to adjust plans and observe local ethics requirements for research was key even when proven challenging. Example for this are the studies in Qatar, which have faced severe delays due to unforeseen additional ethics requirements.  In KSA, delays and quality concerns related to local data collection through qualitative methods, such as expert interviews and focus groups, have delayed some research projects.  
·         The SDGs and the inclusion of high-income countries in a common development agenda with all other countries has served as a key entry point to collaborate with the Gulf countries. There is now a willingness in the sub-region to engage around data, SDG reporting and global ranking that is unprecedented. For UNICEF GAO, this is a great opportunity to fully engage with national authorities (including National Statistical Offices, Ministries of Planning, Health, Education and other entities) to provide the technical support and guidance needed to help the Governments review existing data and all its parameters and align with international best practices in reporting on SDG indicators on a routine and sustainable basis.

MENAR,Sudan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The changing political and donor environment required UNICEF in Sudan to be exceptionally agile in fulfilling its mandate. Even given these challenging circumstances, UNICEF delivered $242M in programming in 2022. 
 
To diversify implementation modalities, UNICEF expanded delivery through the NGO partners and direct cash.  In working ever more closely with I/NGOs to engage directly at the community level, UNICEF leaned heavily on its country-wide vulnerability mapping to reach those children most at risk.
 
This is supported by the repositioning of the approach to nutrition, and the implementation of the No Time to Waste strategy in Sudan. The triple emphasis of prevention, early detection and treatment will over time reduce the humanitarian burden of malnutrition and offers an opportunity to make real gains for children’s rights in Sudan.
 
The rollout of the MCCT+ programme sees UNICEF directly deliver social protection services planned by the previous civilian government, in such a way as to be able to return this to the ownership of a future civilian government. This was facilitated by the rapid establishment of the Cash Implementation Unit, supporting integrated programming for the First 1000 Days. It is a crucial part of reducing neonatal deaths in Sudan, stubbornly high for decades.
 
Health and Nutrition
By preserving systems and integration of services UNICEF continued providing lifesaving health and nutrition services despite instability in Sudan, reaching the most vulnerable women and children. To catch up on the backlog of un/under vaccinated children, UNICEF supported the bundling of routine vaccination into Covid-19 vaccination campaigns. 
 
UNICEF mitigated the impact of WFPs nationwide Ready-To-Use Supplementary Food pipeline break through successfully implementing a simplified approach to treat severe acute malnutrition until the child is cured using RUTF at Outpatient Therapeutic Programme centers. 
 
UNICEF’s ongoing response to C-19 demonstrates the value and importance of social and behavioral data and evidence, to help inform quality programming for example, to incorporating communities’ preferences or build trust in medical professionals for effective message delivery and two-way communication. 
 
WASH
In 2022, Sudan saw a reduction in WASH public investment. With the ongoing spike in inflation, households within communities trying to retain open defecation free status struggled to make the necessary investments towards improving their basic toilets due to the six to eight-fold increase in cost of materials. Such context demonstrated the need for continued sanitation market shaping, as well as supply chains and financing interventions.
 
Resilience programming and sustainability of services has been affected by the absence of robust institutional strengthening mechanisms, and poor ownership by State Governments. Nonetheless, UNICEF’s interventions played a critical role in curtailing such impact. For example, by providing at-scale investment in climate resilient infrastructure, such as solar powered water supply systems capitalizing on the reduction of solar pumping technology cost in Sudan, thus contributing to the decrease in capital and operational expenditures. 
 
Engagement of youth as social activists was key for the success of UNICEF’s WASH community-based interventions. By equipping young people with the skills and knowledge and engaging with WASH data, UNICEF tapped into scale of youth-lead community activism for disseminating water disinfection practices, raising awareness on the importance of household water treatment and safe storage. 
 
 
Education & Learning
 
With 7 million children out of school, traditional approaches to education programming will not be enough. Embracing digital innovation and transformation offers the route, over time, to bring Sudan’s out of school children into quality learning, fundamentally altering their future, and the future of Sudan. UNICEF built upon the national success of the Learning Passport to develop innovative and contextualized educational content specifically targeting out of school children through gamified learning and with zero rating committed by all mobile network operators in Sudan. This work was especially relevant in supporting 5,500 of the most vulnerable out of school children. Both No Time to Waste and MCCT+ will be important in ensuring that children are healthy and have developed well by the time they enter learning. 
 
To address the lack of centralized information on public schools, UNICEF & GIGA collaborated with OmdenaLore to develop an AI model to identify school locations using satellite imagery and machine learning. UNICEF Sudan mapped 20,000 schools to help understand the scale of investment, actions and partnerships needed to bridge the digital divide and to provide learning opportunities for all school age children in Sudan.
 
 
Child Protection 
 
Youth engagement has been a key strategy for community dialogue on FGM & Child Marriage and other social norms with negative consequence on children such as the recruitment and use of children in armed groups and armed forces. 
 
The road map on the release and sustainable reintegration of the children associated with armed forces and armed groups has been an innovative approach to all the JPA at the same time to protect children against the grave violations of their rights. 
 
Integration between child protection, Education & WASH resulted to efficient packaging of services and cost effectiveness in the prevention and response to FGM and CM at both national, state & community levels. 
 

Policy Evidence & Social ProtectionThe MCCT+ programme, one of the key flagships proposed in the draft National Social Protection Strategy, is increasingly recognized as an emerging good practice globally and is part to four global evaluations/studies (Global Evaluation of UNICEF Social Protection Response toward Universal Child Benefits; the Global Review of Gender Responsive Social Protection; a Case Study for the Nutrition and Social Protection Linkages; and a study on Conflict Sensitive Social Protection Programming).
 
Given the enormity of operational challenges to rolling out cash programming in Sudan - including distance, infrastructure, and logistics - UNICEF strengthened its internal capacity in cash programming. One challenge was communities’ lack of trust in government and partners. This was overcome by conducting accelerated and more elaborate community outreach including the engagement of tribal chiefs. As a result, the programme was able to reach 52,000 pregnant and lactating women, benefitting a total of 312,000 individuals in Kassala and Red Sea states.   

"
MENAR,Syria,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In 2022, UNICEF Syria released a series of think pieces under the theme of Every Day Counts which outlined how UNICEF – along with other UN agencies - seeks to shift its programming towards early recovery while maintaining the delivery of humanitarian assistance based on needs on the ground. The pieces covered child protection, education, health, nutrition and WASH and reviewed the impact and lessons taken from staying and delivering during the 11 years of conflict in Syria. Based on these lessons and considering the immense humanitarian needs facing children in 2022, the pieces then laid out a way forward, including the strategic shifts and investments required to support children at scale focus on resilience and early recovery. The way forward also aligned with the formative evaluation on the Strategic Shift to Resilience completed in 2022.
 
As one example of this shift, UNICEF is accelerating its shift from a primarily emergency WASH response to a continuum of rapid, sustained and equitable response with longer-term solutions that build the resilience of communities and sector systems to endure shocks and crises, including in response to the changing climate. The solarization of water systems is an important example of this shift: Two systems were solarized in 2021, increasing to nine systems in 2022. UNICEF will continue to scale up these investments moving into its new country programme.
 
The shift towards standardized curricula for Mental Health and Psychosocial Support demonstrates another key step in systematizing quality services for children throughout Syria. Lessons learned from the development of this Manual – including the early and genuine involvement of all relevant stakeholders – are now being applied to the development of a national manual for parenting programmes. These efforts, combined with emerging office-wide inter-sectoral Violence against Children programming, will support a ‘universal prevention’ pillar of UNICEF Child Protection programming by tackling the behavioural, social and cultural determinants of child protection violations at scale with the aim of addressing harmful social and gender norms. The successful case management pilot, started in Rural Damascus and to be expanded across the country, is also a key pillar of this work.
 
While no think piece was developed specifically reflecting on ADAP programming, evidence generated in 2022 has helped in identifying steps for a similar shift. An Evaluability Assessment was conducted by an independent Youth Specialist consultant along with NGOs, line ministries, young people, UNICEF sections and UN agencies, and six Syrian youth researchers (three females). The Assessment identified the clear relevance of the ADAP programme in terms of participation and social cohesion but also constraints to scalability such as declining funds and resource-intensive activities and need to linkages with available systems and accreditation. A separate survey of 450 TVET graduates (258 females) recommended increasing connections with community activities to enable graduates to apply their training; increasing the number and duration of the courses to learn on a deeper scale; promoting hands-on training; and providing equipment for users to train at home. To date, UNICEF has delivered TVET courses through its partnerships with NGOs. However, this service delivery mechanism is costly and has limitations on the sustainability and scalability, as well as the types of improvement requested by the TVET graduate survey. Based on these findings, UNICEF will increase its systems-focus for TVET in the coming years. This shift will also be informed by the 2021 UNICEF TVET assessment, which concluded that reform is required at various levels – access, quality, governance, funding. 
 
Children and young people in Syria are on the wrong side of the digital divide, limiting their access to the same learning opportunities as their connected peers in other countries. As education systems increasingly invest in innovative and resilient delivery methods in the wake of the COVID-19, the need for solutions to deliver digital learning to the most marginalized has never been more urgent. As part of transforming education, the Learning Passport was adopted for digital learning in non-formal education activities supporting out of school children. A pilot project was initiated with first phase of digital material preparation, and the second phase started by reaching 500 children in two governorates (Aleppo and Hama) to be then expanded to five governorates (adding Al Hasakeh, Homs, Rural Damascus). Initial analysis of the project revealed that using the standardized and centralized content based on SLM was key factor to success. On the other hand, diversifying delivery platforms included using blended learning based on tablets, in computer labs and using their parents' mobiles helped provide required flexibility.
 
The winter response was redesigned based on the lessons learned from the 2021/2022 response. Post-distribution monitoring highlighted the need to increase the amount and frequency of cash assistance, leading to an increase from one-off payments to three rounds of $60 in unconditional cash assistance for a total of US$ 180 between October 2022 and February 2023. Results also highlighted the need to focus on the most vulnerable families, leading to targeting based on four eligibility criteria: female-headed families; families with a child and/or adult with a disability; families with a child and/or adult with a chronic illness; and families with orphan children. Finally, it was noted that cash was most needed before the onset of winter. Thanks to the early financial contributions of partners, the winter response was initiated in the summer of 2022. Between August and October 2022, a lengthy and rigorous registration exercise was conducted through door-to-door visits in the communities identified for the winter response. As a result, 20,933 families meeting the eligibility criteria were identified and registered in Aleppo, Hama and Rural Damascus Governorate. Due to lack of funding, the winter response in Homs could not take place this year.

MENAR,Tunisia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"UNICEF’s support to evidence-based policy making, including the budget briefs by the Ministry of Finance, the evaluation of the 0-5 years old child benefit programme, and the upcoming update of child-related indicators with the MICS2023, continue to attract keen interest from partners and strengthened UNICEF’s contribution as a knowledge broker for children. Thanks to its continuous and consistent engagement in public finance for children, UNICEF contributes to technical discussions with the IMF to better understand the impacts of the planned socio- economic reforms on social sectors and children welfare.

The extension of the child benefit to the 6-18 years old group is fully in line with government priorities as indicated in the Prime Minister’s reform programme presented in June 2022. One of the reform axes is dedicated to promoting social inclusion and makes explicit reference to the child grant as part of ongoing social protection floor reforms.  The reform programme also includes plans for a national campaign to sensitize the population on the relevance and advantages of moving towards a new system. The extension of the child benefit to the 6-18 years old age group enables the country to measure the impact of doing this, whilst at the same time providing direct support to families most in need in the current difficult socio-economic context. UNICEF will continue to document the impacts of cash transfers on households so that national and international stakeholders can use this evidence to support the Universal Child Benefit as a key programme in the broader socio-economic reform agenda, as a critical measure to absorb the shocks of the subsidy reform on the most vulnerable, while ensuring continued investments in human capital.

The fact that UNICEF was selected as grant agent for the system capacity grant of the Global Partnership for Education provided a key opportunity for UNICEF to advocate for due focus on equity and quality of education in the sectoral analysis of the education sector. In addition, jointly with the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs an innovative fundraising initiative was launched in July 2022 among the Tunisian diaspora through the Global Giving Platform. It has been agreed to take stock of the experimentation in July 2023 in order to decide on next steps.  

UNICEF successfully capitalized on two major international events organised in Tunisia in 2022: the TICAD8 (Tokyo International Conference on African Development) organised in Tunis in August 2022 and the Sommet de la Francophonie organised in Djerba in November 2022. Both events represented important advocacy opportunities for children, and UNICEF's support to the Government for the organisation of side-events on both occasions was greatly appreciated. UNICEF’s contribution to the TICAD8 was recognised with a certificate of merit awarded by the Ambassador of Japan. 

In terms of innovation, the Ministry of Health decided to build on the success of the Evax.tn platform used for the roll out of the COVID-19 vaccine to expand the system to comprise all vaccines, following a joint presentation of the TUNeVACC during the TICAD8 conference. The pilot introduction of the digital vaccination card in the Governorates of Sousse and Kasserine provided a key opportunity for UNICEF to support this process, whilst at the same time contributing to improved routine immunization results for children. UNICEF already mobilized donor support for the implementation of this starting from 2023. 
 
The secondary impacts of the war in Ukraine have accelerated the need to reform the subsidies and price-cap system in place, and laid bare the heavy dependence on grains for dietary intake. As part of strengthening nutrition practices for children, UNICEF mobilized resources to in 2023 support policy reform and public awareness outreach for more balanced nutrition for children, in cooperation with the Ministries of Health, Agriculture and Trade. This equally provides an opportunity to capitalise on the work undertaken in support of the development and roll-out of the national positive parenting programme, and its synergies with the social protection programme. 
 
UNICEF also supported  young Climate Change negotiators participating at the COP27 in Egypt and youth involved in the participatory action research to advocate for youth participation using the Young Climate Activists Toolkit developed by the UNICEF MENA regional office. In addition, roundtable discussion on climate change of the Minister of Education with Tunisian youth from all regions was supported during the Sommet de la Francophonie in November 2022. UNICEF mobilised important funding to work on Climate Change in schools through USAID, and importantly, in December 2022 the Ministry of Education decided to introduce Climate Change in the curricula in primary schools, work which will be pursued in 2023. As Tunisia is the 30th most water-stressed country worldwide, the negative impacts of Climate Change represent an important additional risk for children and UNICEF will aim to substantially invest in support for dialogue, awareness and policy solutions for the remainder of the country programme
"
MENAR,Yemen,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"A number of lessons learned and challenges identified in  2022 were taken into account in the development of UNICEF’s 2023-2024 Country  Programme for Yemen, which focuses more on    integrating various programme interventions  and enhancing cross-sectoral approaches to maximise quality results for  children in the country.  
    
Humanitarian funding in Yemen remains constrained. In 2022,  partners accelerated the discussion on more integration of the humanitarian  and development programmes factoring in the chronic situation in Yemen. This  integration was a key discussion point in the UN Senior Officers’ Meeting in  Brussels where UNICEF co-led the session on the humanitarian-development  nexus. UNICEF remains an active partner in various forums for the nexus,  including the Yemen Partners Group.
  
To holistically address the needs of children in Yemen, during  2022 substantial efforts were made towards programme integration to improve  impact and service coverage. For example, as part of the EHCP, WASH services were delivered as a package at both facility  and community levels. Programmatic intersects between child  protection/education and health included integrated approaches to provide  psychosocial support to children and their caregivers through health  facilities and schools. Vulnerable children were identified by experienced  social workers who regularly visited health facilities and referred children to  be provided with critical child protection services.
   
These integrated approaches helped to maximise results for children,  providing quality services while accessing more vulnerable children. However,  putting in place such integrated programmes requires an extended period of  coordination and harmonisation across multiple sections. This remains  challenging to implement with short-term funding and certain conditionalities  of available funding. 
  
In the area of social protection and inclusion, working  with and through existing systems such as the Social  Welfare Fund and the Handicap Care and Rehabilitation Fund resulted  in better access and responsiveness  to the needs of the most vulnerable children and their families. However,  there is a need to continue investing in partners’ capacity in the coming  years. While cash assistance has a powerful impact on the survival and  thriving of children, the needs are huge so there is a need to scale up  linkages between unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) and services for a more  effective response to children’s needs and also to scale up UCTs to cover  additional vulnerable groups.
  
The multiple crises in Yemen led to a further deterioration of the already  challenging situation of vulnerable groups such as the Muhamasheen, a minority faced with caste-based  discrimination, and children with disabilities. This  highlighted the need for an integrated multi-sectoral social protection  response to multi-dimensional poverty and vulnerabilities, hence the  importance of the Cash Plus approach.
  
External communication is central to UNICEF’s advocacy and  during 2022 UNICEF provided a broad range of interviews and content to local  and international media outlets. The engagement of young people in the  development of UNICEF’s advocacy products has been critical to provide a clear  venue for their participation and engagement. 
  
Restrictions on RCCE, particularly in the northern  governorates, remained a major challenge throughout 2022. These restrictions  included impounding supplies (such as the toolkits of community volunteers  and reusable face masks), obstructing certain community engagement activities,  such as Mother-to-Mother clubs in some locations, as well as the reluctance  of authorities in Sana’a to explicitly mention COVID-19 in RCCE  interventions. One of the lessons learned is the need to further strengthen  the role of religious and community leaders in RCCE to address misconceptions  derived from distorted religious beliefs that affect the adoption of promoted  practices or vaccination acceptance. 
  
The continuous collaboration between the different clusters  and UNICEF programme teams at central and field office level continued to be  important for timely and effective emergency planning and preparedness. Under  UNICEF’s cluster leadership, the focus remained on ensuring an integrated  response to meet needs rather than a siloed sectoral approach.
  
Evidence generation activities  continue to show that health professionals are highly trusted by their  communities. The mobilisation and integration of trained medical doctors and  midwives to engage their community and respond to their concerns contributed  to addressing various rumours and misconceptions, especially about vaccines.  Where mobilised and provided a platform, young people often become agents for  social and behaviour change within their own community, encouraging their  peers and families to adopt positive practices.
  
In 2022, nine SMART (Standardised Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions) surveys were  conducted in various governorates with UNICEF support, providing critical information  for programming. In addition, data collection and analysis for the Multiple  Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) was completed in the southern governorates,  while by year-end teams of interviewers were trained for data collection in  the northern governorates, scheduled for the first quarter of 2023.
  
During 2022, UNICEF Yemen  completed an evaluation of the Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) programme  and an evaluation of the Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM). Another four  evaluations continued and an evaluative review, an evaluability assessment  and a Yemen evaluation stakeholder mapping exercise were completed. All  the large evaluations commissioned in 2021 made use of evaluation reference  groups, which included staff from external partners and donors.
  
Faced with continuing challenges to access certain parts of the country, UNICEF  Yemen has inverted the contractual relationship between national and  international evaluation firms, so that national firm takes the  lead. This arrangement contributed to reducing bureaucratic impediments,  while providing both firms the opportunity for evaluation capacity development  as part of the evaluations. Evaluation contracts with individual  consultants are being phased out and replaced by contracts with larger  evaluation teams that can produce quality evaluations while at the same time  provide evaluation capacity development opportunities to team members during evaluations.

The basic banking environment continued to be challenging for providing smooth financial support services due to liquidity and the unstable local currency exchange rate, especially in the southern governorates of Yemen. UNICEF Yemen continued to review and enhance capacities to efficiently process high-risk programme payments. The registration of banks with the Central Bank of Yemen (north and south) still remains an issue.

"
SAR,Afghanistan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Nutrition Programme’s experience in 2022 has shown that if nutrition services, mostly community-based interventions, contributing to nutrition preventive programs including Community Based Nutrition Programme (CBNP), Micronutrition Powder (MNP) supplementation, community-based Weekly Iron and Folic acid Supplements (C-WIFS) are planned, implemented, and delivered as a package, then they can have a maximum impact in reducing malnutrition. In 2022, the implementation of these interventions as a package, enabled the office to optimize delivery through implementing partners and the programmes were well received by the Provincial Nutrition Department (PND) which facilitated signing of some of the MoUs. Nutrition section in 2023, nutrition will use these lessons learnt to scale-up lifesaving nutrition treatment services and expand preventive actions. 
 
Empowerment of local structures (Community Development Councils - CDCs) remained a core working modality for WASH services delivery including in humanitarian context. Implementation through CDCs is a cost effective and quick implementation modality which was proven during the earthquake response in Paktika province this year. In addition, Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) approach proved to be a successful tool in eradicating open defecation and provision of improved sanitation facilities without any subsidy which is also an appropriate tool for value for money. Implementation through the extenders is the cheapest modality and key to scaling up sanitation in rural areas with less funding requirement in comparison to NGO modality because it ensures sustainability of ODF status. The extenders will spend at least 3 months in the district after the district attain ODF certificate. WASH programme will support capacity building activities for local structures including staff and partners to sustain the gains made. 
 
The collapse of the banking system posed a major constraint to the delivery of humanitarian cash transfers. UNICEF adapted to this challenge by establishing the Programme Management Unit (PMU) which was charged with managing large scale and sensitive payments, including payment of cash transfers within this difficult context. PMU in collaboration with non-traditional financial providers within the country ensured stable delivery of sensitive payments. In working to overcome existing UNICEF Information Technology (IT) solution limitations of Humanitarian cash Operations and Programme Ecosystem (HOPE) for beneficiary data management, UNICEF developed a new Global Solution for cash Distribution (GSD) to handle large scale humanitarian cash transfers and grievance redressal data. The system offers a strong grievance and feedback module that allows UNICEF to receive and process grievances in a timely manner. This solution will now be adopted globally by the HOPE team and made available to other country offices. 
 
UNICEF adopted innovative ways to intensify and increase polio awareness across the country, especially the use of roundtable discussions with key influencers to engage communities and address key concerns, including the establishment of a social media cell(s) to improve online engagement and accelerate polio awareness. These efforts have contributed to an average reach of 29 million users every month, transforming community engagement dynamics in educating, informing and persuading caregivers to vaccinate their children against polio. As a result, an average of 9.3 million children were vaccinated during national campaigns reaching 93 per cent coverage. These innovative approaches will be intensified in 2023 to enhance strategic engagement and advocacy on child development issues especially in undeserved districts. 
 
While physical access has largely improved across the country, the operational environment remains complex and challenging. Recent responses to rapid-onset emergencies at the interagency level have largely been incoherent in terms of needs assessments, information sharing and the rapidity of response at scale. This was evidenced in the earthquake response. Building on lessons learned from the earthquake, UNICEF is setting up a Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM), to eliminate multiple needs assessments, duplication of efforts and ensure a cohesive narrative. This would enable the humanitarian community to rapidly respond to shocks in a coordinated, cost-effective, dignified manner. The RRM will provide quick impact, first response, covering the basic survival needs of populations affected by rapid-onset emergencies for a period of two months. To complement, UNICEF is developing rapid deployment kits, which would allow teams to rapidly deploy to deep-field locations where there are no existing facilities. These will be prepositioned in field offices to strengthen rapid response when required.
 
Building on the successes and lesson learnt, UNICEF ACO will work towards sustaining the gains made and to accelerate progress towards achieving results planned for 2023
"
SAR,Bangladesh,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Transforming education for quality learning outcomes requires more than a linear process, it needs time, commitment in partnership, and a consistent effort from the Government. UNICEF and other partner's engagement with Government need to be adjusted to consistently emphasise a long-term approach coupled with continuous testing and scaling up of Alternative Teaching and Learning Models before scaling up. These pilots when evaluated periodically, contributes to enhanced sustainability and ownership from the government. Strengthening data, evidence generation and knowledge management are also crucial for evaluating past and ongoing education programmes and for designing future programmes as demonstrated by UNICEF's partnership with EdTech Hub and Agami Education Foundation which explored emerging technology-enhanced education systems in Bangladesh. The partnership with Agami will improve education outcomes through digital knowledge-based skills and competencies. 
 
The anticipatory action (a forecasting-based) approach, facilitated by OCHA and the RCO in 2021 and 2022 for monsoon flood response, proved effective in motivating government agencies and partners to open new funding windows and include them in sectoral programmes. This approach strengthens community resilience and flood mitigation capacity.UNICEF will buildon the experiences from this pilot in expanding this approach beyond the flood response to incorporating it as a key component of WASH-Humanitarian response programming in Bangladesh from 2023 and beyond.   
 
The introduction of real-time monitoring reduced the gap in implementation and results data allowed the programme to respond quickly to challenges through the mobile data collection platforms. UNICEF received results on the agreed indicators at the lowest administrative and facility levels, including beneficiary data disaggregated by age, gender, and disability. 
  
UNICEF's advocacy with Directorate Secondary and Higher Education and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare helped to steer political leadership to introduce a universal adolescent nutrition programme and the CO learned that the establishment of partnerships with private sector and non-conventional stakeholders requires time and persistent advocacy to be successful. Coordinating the different operational plans of the Ministry of Health led to the finalization of a community-based engagement model and the development of ECCD Strategy for 0-3yr age. Continuous advocacy with the government led to the initiation of an effectiveness trial of locally produced ready-to-use therapeutic food to treat severe wasted children without complications in the home/community. Innovative approaches including Real Time Monitoring, and inclusion of hard-to-reach areas led effective coverage of Vitamin A Supplementation. 
  
During 2022, UNICEF worked to expand and strengthen the child protection system [EB1] in line with national and UNICEF Global Strategy. Through a process of advocacy, capacity building, and investments, UNICEF was able to reach more than 13 million people with some form of child protection intervention. The community led and community focused approach enabled a larger reach while reducing per beneficiary costs. The aim is to continue to push this approach with government while they increasingly take ownership and accountability of the system. In 2022 we have already seen some progress on ownership including the Government taking steps to expand the social service workforce and the creation of the child protection unit.   
 
The COVID-19 pandemic and recent floods further reiterated the importance of systemic nationwide adaptive social protection[EB2] . UNICEF continues to strengthen coordination mechanisms and monitoring support to partners for efficient humanitarian responses. and provide informative and accurate data to continue informing and influencing the decision-making process. 
 
The extensive reach of COVID-19 vaccination and equally the birth registration campaign was made possible with robust communication and effective community engagement[EB3] . In the case of the COVID-19 vaccine the District Information Offices and religious leaders played a key role in vaccine communication reaching isolated areas.
 
Innovation 
In Bangladesh, UNICEF focused on harnessing innovations to efficiently respond to and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic by maximising the use of information technology for improved programme delivery. Face-to-face capacity development was replaced with online and offline modules for maximising reach. For example, the online training on Operational Guidelines for Implementing Adolescent Nutrition Interventions reached 83,507 participants who completed the e-course and received an e-certificate. The widescale response led to the expansion of weekly iron folic acid supplementation for girls in all secondary schools.
 
An oxygen management information system was adopted based on UNICEF Oxygen System Planning Tool, piloted, and adopted for implementation covering 30 Health Facilities. UNICEF designed an Interactive Audio Instruction application to deliver lessons in the classroom and other camp settings in Bangladesh, providing teachers with professional development and children with high-quality instruction. For Rohingya children, this application is an enduring source of continuing education in their native language while helping to build a resilient education system that can continue in the face of pandemics, natural disasters, and/or conflict.
 
UNICEF supported the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs to adopt a national violence and harmful practice prevention programme following the sustainability and scalability strategy to ensure direct implementation by the Ministry, leading to an increase in outreach equivalent to 71 times that of 2021 (6,461,026 children reached in 2022 and 117,000 children in 2021) and a decrease in cost per beneficiary [EB4] from US$75 per child to less than US$1.  
 
In Cox's Bazar, UNICEF supported 18 Information and Feedback Centres using real-time online/offline mobile based apps[EB5] , facilitating continuous feedback integration into humanitarian response facilitating 46,796 complaints, feedback, and queries to be processed, and responses analysed and used to incorporate the beneficiaries needs and feedback into programme implementation.

"
SAR,Bhutan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"GA1: EVERY CHILD SURVIVES AND THRIVES
 
Innovation: Water contamination from flooding, landslides, inadequate and damaged sanitation infrastructure, and poor management of wastewater pose risks to providing sustainable quality WASH services. Introduction of new technologies (i.e., installation of water filtration system with high grade pipes, elbow/pedal-operated faucet and water saving aerators in all tap points) will help provide sustainable access to safe drinking water and prevent the spread of infectious diseases at health care facilities as well as enhance effective use of water resources.
 
GA2: EVERY CHILD LEARNS
 
Lesson learned: The steady recruitment of ECCD facilitators continues to be a challenge due to the ongoing civil service reform. Advocacy with the Ministry of Education to use innovative ways to resolve this issue, especially by working with the local governments, must continue. 
 
GA3: EVERY CHILD IS PROTECTED FROM VIOLENCE AND EXPLOITATION
 
Lesson learned: Extensive consultations with different members of the community including persons with diverse gender identities and with disabilities helped inform the design and establishment of the Women and Girls Safe Spaces. This ensured that these Centre are providing services that are tailored to the needs of women and girls and have also led to greater ownership by the community and local leaders. 
 
Innovation: Civic engagement and participation training co-designed with potential employers from the private sector helped to provide marketable skills for unemployed youth. Engaging the MoE and partners in the planning process and rollout of the UPSHIFT programme across 64 schools and 10 youth centers helped to garner support and commitment from the decision makers from each agency, expanding the programme across 20 districts within a short duration. Further the building capacity of each focal person, Principals and districts education officer helped to streamline implementation of projects across schools and youth centers. Engagement and feedback gathered from young people also contributed towards reaching the most unreached youth.  
 
Innovation: To enhance learning experience of young people and support schools and youth centres to scale up the UPSHIFT programme, UNICEF’s Regional Office for South Asia (ROSA) and Office of Innovation supported to implement UNISOLVE, a digital platform designed to facilitate UPSHIFT delivery through a school-based, teacher-facilitated blended learning model. UNISOLVE combines the advantages of distance learning opportunities and face-to-face activities to promote creativity among adolescents and young people. Designed with and for the education system, keeping scalability in mind, UNISOLVE aims to skill students on social innovation and 21st century skills.
 
CROSS-CUTTING:  
 
Lesson learned: COVID-19 restrictions and the civil service reform posed risks to timely implementation of planned activities with regular government implementing partners. Anticipating these risks, UNICEF expanded its partnerships with non-traditional partners namely, CSOs, faith-based organizations, youth networks, mainstream media and social media, allowing most planned activities to be implemented on time.
 
Lesson learned: Intra- and inter-sectoral collaboration remain critical in ensuring effective social and behavior change interventions to address issues as the country recovers from the pandemic. Partnering with non-traditional partners such as CSOs, religious organizations, sports bodies, and leveraging social media and mainstream media reach was effective for community engagement. The technical and financial support received from the ROSA’s SBC Programme was instrumental in implementing joint multisectoral SBC initiatives.
 
Lesson learned: Leveraging Campaigns, partnerships and linking the issues affecting children for international days such as the World Children’s Day proved powerful in advocating the rights of children and in securing renewed commitment from the Government to uphold the provisions and principals of the CRC. Engaging new partners and influencers such as the Bhutan Football Federation, Humans of Thimphu, an online storytelling platform by a group of youth, and the Snowman Race Secretariat to support advocacy for child rights were effective in positioning issues affecting children and young people high on the national agenda.
 
Innovation: Based on the emerging needs of the new country programme and COVID-19 RCCE experiences, with support of ROSA, UNICEF Bhutan has initiated the development of an interactive mobile App platform designed for parents, harmonizing lifesaving advisories across the sectors. The App will be launched in 2023.
 
The lessons learned highlighted above will be considered and taken forward while developing the new CPP (2024-2028), and to inform the annual priorities of the subsequent years.

The implementation of the Country Programme 2018-2022 and the unprecedented experience of responding to a global pandemic have highlighted some key lessons, including the need for gender transformative programming, a strong equity lens to reach those farthest behind, and strengthening the participation of children and young people. 
 
 To sustain and build on gains made in tackling gender inequities in India, UNICEF will continue championing gender transformative priorities in India. It is critical to continue promoting the agency, voice and leadership of women and girls, challenge and change harmful gender norms and address the gaps in access to knowledge and services. 
 
UNICEF implemented its programme with an equity lens, addressing inequalities to reach the most vulnerable and marginalised children. Improved evidence and understanding of inequities and their drivers combined with a strong field presence and decentralised support at the state level positions UNICEF well to promote the equity agenda and to reach the hardest-to-reach/most vulnerable children. A lesson learned is that when supporting Government led approaches via flagship programmes, efforts should be further strengthened to reach the most vulnerable children, including through systems strengthening at the state and district levels.[1] In addition, there is a need for decentralization of resources and powers coupled with flexibility in spending norms at local Government level enabling timely actions on disaster preparedness to address the changing patterns of emergencies due to climate change. 
UNICEF has advocated for institutionalising adolescent and youth participation through formal decision-making platforms at the block, district, state, and national levels. The rise of youth volunteerism during the pandemic illustrated the powerful role young people can play and the need to engage them as active change-makers. Through UNICEF and YuWaah (Generation Unlimited in India), more than 4 million young people have been engaged in youth engagement/volunteering networks. A lesson learned is, therefore, the need to further focus on meaningful engagement of adolescents and youth as an enabler of empowerment for children and young people and an accelerator of development goals for children.[2]
UNICEF India successfully expanded its engagement with the private sector in the current country programme, including partnerships with private sector platforms, networks, and aggregators at the central and state level committed to protecting and promoting child rights, including strengthened partnerships related to the primary healthcare system in the context of the global pandemic. Moving forward, there is potential to reflect on and refine UNICEF's approach to partnership, including responding to evolving partnerships. Furthermore, UNICEF's efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic response and recovery process offer a unique opportunity to create synergies and convergence with all relevant development sectors to support children's survival and development rights. 
Innovation
 
The post-pandemic world requires strategic innovation and digital transformation to address the intensified deprivations in its wake. 
 
UNICEF has scaled up the deployment of Information, Communication Technology and innovations for supporting quality primary health care service delivery and system strengthening across the UNICEF-supported states; as an example, UNICEF supported the development and deployment of an online labour room management system - MaNTrA (Maa Navjaat Tracking App) - in Uttar Pradesh, covering 25,835 health facilities across 75 districts, which has registered 2 million pregnant women already. UNICEF  has also supported MoHFW in redeveloping the RCH 2.0 Portal, a national MIS for maternal and child health services. UNICEF engaged 30 million caregivers and influencers with maternal and newborn health messages and leveraged 16 million USD from public budgeting for RMNCAH demand generation activities. In addition, the Community-Based Monitoring (CBM) of women and children was designed and rolled out in partnership with a Civil Society Network of 21 Organisations, including 374 community volunteers to inform shock-responsive social protection and social services. 
 
UNICEF learned, leveraged and supported the scale-up of high-impact programmes towards achieving results for children in India. 
 
Through co-financing from the Government, UNICEF and Power of Nutrition have been a catalyst for the successful scale-up of Early Childhood Development (ECD) interventions in all districts of Maharashtra. ""Aarambh"" started as a WHO-supported pilot project in 2017 in 44 villages/ 10 blocks. The objective was to test the ECD Nurturing Care Framework (WHO-UNICEF) delivery to the most vulnerable population through existing government platforms. Evidence from the modelling demonstrated improved children's nutrition outcomes, infant and young child practices and psychosocial development scores. In addition, technical and financial support to a national and state-level network of Centers of Excellence (nearly 32 academic partnerships) helped accelerate the rollout of key nutrition interventions, including early sensory and psychosocial stimulation as part of Early Childhood Development.
 
Building on the learning from the pilot, UNICEF supported the state government to contextualise and consolidate the initial work. The evidence generated from these two districts enabled the translation of the science of ECD from a pilot at the village level into two districts and, in 2022, towards a state-wide scale-up reaching 2.5 million children under five years of age. Fully recognising the gains in the process of human capital development, the state government endorsed the Aarambh approach and backed it up with a resource commitment of USD 1.7 million. 
 
The launch of Mission Vatsalya and Shakti has created the space for building an inclusive and resilient system to protect and empower children with a focus on prevention. This offers opportunities for nationwide childcare reform. Furthermore, in 2022, the Young Warrior NXT brought together 30+ partners to build evidence on the types of scalable, impactful life skills delivery models. These interventions collectively reached approximately 88,000 young people across 12 states of India, and 15,742 impacted students took the baseline. End-line assessments, wherein 51 per cent of these respondents saw an improvement in their skill scores. The learnings from these pilots highlighted the importance of offline teaching, training teachers to impart life skills, and self-paced learning requiring in-person nudges to bring about high impact. The most impactful pilots are being supported for scale-up.

SAR,Maldives,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Within the “Young girls and boys develop and thrive” programme component, UNICEF has proactively engaged with donors supporting immunization systems-strengthening. The systematic information sharing with the Asian Development Bank, USAID and World Bank has contributed to more coordinated support, minimizing duplication of resources. Further improvements can be made with regular sharing of information among all key partners working in the same areas, and support to health sector on common areas can be further streamlined.
 
The health sector was in emergency response mode at the beginning of 2022, due to government staff working both on routine programming and COVID-19 response. This led to delays in activity implementation, specifically of time-bound donor funds. To address this, UNICEF assigned personnel or consultants to programmes to facilitate activity roll-out and monitoring, leading to progress with activities and achievement of results. The lesson learned for UNICEF is to identify capacity bottlenecks that impede timely implementation, and to be agile enough to address them.
 
To promote integrated, comprehensive and coordinated services, efforts should focus on bringing stakeholders together to improve child health and early childhood development. Consultation on ANC/PNC and the child health record brought health subsectors together. However, high-level leadership is needed to bring together a wider range of relevant stakeholders beyond the health sector. 
 
The roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccine underscored the need for stronger immunization and cold chain systems. UNICEF also used the opportunity to carry out evidence-based advocacy for systems strengthening to improve routine immunization. 
 
It was important to establish the steering committee at the beginning of the JPPP to ensure broader participation and ownership. The steering committee is also helping to increase participation and contributions from different sectors and to ensure a multisectoral approach. A review of existing programmes delivered by different sectors, with the participation of the steering committee has been critical to ensure agreement among partners on existing gaps in content, human resources capacity and to decide on the way forward.  
 
A key lesson learned in 2022 was the importance of multisectoral collaboration to ensure success of interventions. UNICEF paid particular attention to ensuring that its support was geared to include multiple stakeholders in programmatic processes, to help standardize practices across the social sector and maximize benefits for children. This also serves the additional benefit of making programmes more comprehensive and reducing duplication of resources through strengthening articulation, synergy and complementarity between different agencies. In this sense, UNICEF’s support to programmatic activities was undertaken with a multisectoral approach, whereby all relevant stakeholders were involved. For example, all relevant sectors were involved in the juvenile justice training for judges and magistrates, so that all actors were aware of the standards that the judiciary would adhere to in child protection and juvenile justice cases; and the standard operating procedure on case conferences was developed in a multisectoral way, so that all child protection actors adhered to the same standards.
 
Another key learning is the importance of knowledge exchange and learning from best practices of other countries on new and emerging issues. For example, study visits to Georgia on de-institutionalization provided an opportunity to learn best practices in family-based care options, which UNICEF has been advocating for. Exposure to existing best practices helps in learning what does and does not work, and ways to adapt to the country context. High-level participation in these exposure study visits also helped facilitate high-level advocacy.
 
UNICEF also learned the importance of making programmes sustainable and institutionalized. Engagement with key policy-level decision makers was crucial to scaling up relevant programmes. For example, high-level engagement was crucial in the roll-out of IBAMA to address potential pitfalls and ensure its sustainability. The concept was presented to the Social Council at the President's Office and an orientation session was also presented to the councils of the islands, atolls and cities to increase understanding. Wider dissemination of the concept is important for active participation, continuity and scaling up of the initiative. 
 
In the “Sustainable environment policy and financing for children” programme component, UNICEF has been able to position itself as a valid actor in key priority areas through high-level engagement and advocacy events.

In fact, the MCO’s decision to emphasize five flagship programme components has allowed human and financial resources to be oriented to these areas and to position them in the national agenda to generate tangible results.  The five flagship programmes received strong commitment from the highest levels of the government; clearly showing the government’s willingness to work closely with UNICEF to achieve results for children and young people. It will be critical for the country office to maintain and strategically manage these relations to amplify advocacy and strengthen investment in priority areas.
 
UNICEF’s efforts to engage with young people through participatory consultations such as the pre-COP27 buzz event, as well as engaging children and young people of all ages in developing content and advocacy messages, were strengthened in 2022 post-COVID-19 restrictions. However, there needs to be more accessibility and inclusivity in communications and advocacy messages and content. Use of less complex language and more Dhivehi translations for key messages will help messages reach more children and families, especially those left furthest behind. 

In areas such as youth-led climate action and advocacy, creation of an innovative mechanism will enable the MCO to continue regular engagement with children and young people, beyond the reach of one or two-day events. This will help the country office to mobilize young people to push forward the child rights agenda and provide meaningful, strategic ideas and recommendations led by young people on policies, regulations and initiatives that impact their future.

Shifting from sectoral to an integrated approach to programming has not been easy, requiring much more interaction and time from programme staff to understand the process, to make plans and implement together. Although much is still to be done, the MCO was able to progress on the integrated approach internally, thanks to systematic coordination. However, the country office hopes to leverage more partnerships with the private sector next year to advance the child rights agenda.


"
SAR,Nepal,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"At the conclusion of the 2018-2022 Country Programme of Cooperation, key lessons learned from the current programme cycle and the COVID-19 pandemic response include: (1) the importance of strengthening decentralized child-friendly social service systems and capacities in line with the Government’s federalization policy by supporting capacities of provincial and municipal governments; (2) To close service coverage disparities, considerations related to wealth, geography, mobility, ethnicity, caste, gender, and disability have to feature not only in policies, frameworks and plans, but also be reflected in equity-focused programming, budget allocations, implementation and monitoring. 
 
To ensure that UNICEF will remain ‘fit for purpose’ to support Nepal in building on these lessons the six components of the new Cooperation Programme on health; nutrition; water, sanitation and hygiene and child-sensitive climate and environment action, education; child protection; and social protection and child-friendly governance, will have four overarching priorities:
 
(1) Child-friendly governance building capacities for child-friendly policies, plans, strategies, programmes, resource allocations and strengthening service delivery systems at national, provincial and local government levels involving children, families and communities.
(2) Gender equality programming by promoting the well-being and agency of adolescent girls through equitable schooling and skills development, adolescent health and nutrition, positive gender norms, enhanced protection and prevention of harmful practices, especially child marriage, early pregnancy and gender-based and other violence, and mental health support.
(3) Social inclusion focus addressing disparities by age, caste, disability, education, ethnicity, geography, gender, migration and wealth status by modelling effective, equity-focused service delivery approaches.
(4) Disaster risk reduction, climate resilience and environmental sustainability building community resilience, child-sensitive climate adaptation and mitigation models, and enhancing child-centred disaster risk reduction and emergency response capacities of young people and government.
 
Operationally, UNICEF will adapt its current field presence to ensure further increased support to priority provinces and municipalities/palikas in the federalization context.
 
Education: Initially triggered to facilitate continuity of learning during the pandemic-induced extended school closures, UNICEF developed and implemented innovative self-learning approaches which continues to be applied in disaster situations where regular schooling has been interrupted. Using mules and porters, over 140,000 UNICEF-designed self-learning materials were distributed while basic digital technologies such as tablets with audio-visual content focusing on reading and numeracy skills were incorporated into more than 2,400 community-based centres. Widget software was used in picture aided communication tools designed to support holistic development of youth affected by disruption. Additionally, data collection using KOBO's analytical tools enabled effective systematized reporting methods for responding volunteers facing crises situations.
 
Nutrition: UNICEF supported the MOHP in setting up the first ever ‘Human Milk Bank’ – a Comprehensive Lactation Management Centre (CLMC) in Paropakar Maternity Hospital aimed at addressing nutrition risks for premature low-birth weight children and helping to tackle chronically high wasting rates in Nepal.  The innovation is to serve as a model for roll-out across Nepal.

Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: UNICEF initiated an innovative water-safe community concept to help Nepal accelerate access to safely managed drinking water, sanitation and hygiene services through effective campaigns inspiring people's engagement in the Open Defecation Free (ODF) movement. To leverage better collective results, UNICEF continued to promote integration of Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) in the health, nutrition and education sectors. With climate change effects threatening important WASH gains made, increased focus in the collaboration between government, civil society and private sector partners is needed on maintaining sustainable supplies of safe drinking water facilities nationally.
 
Child Protection: As a result of the utilization and optimization of data availability systems, along with rolling out vulnerability assessments, protection monitoring and incident reporting tools - not to mention child/police information management systems as well as Cluster & Civil Registration platforms - evidence-based advocacy for children's rights has been solidified. Moreover, these initiatives have enabled better programme planning within existing resources while supporting local investments in protecting vulnerable populations worldwide.
 
Youth Engagement & Participation: UNICEF continued to facilitate and promote meaningful engagement with young people across all areas of programming and advocacy efforts. Engaging young people has enriched programmatic strategies, outreach to communities and feed-back mechanisms employing U-report and related tools. Tapping into this powerful youth network has also further strengthened advocacy for children's rights. The popularity of social media platforms and applications, particularly amongst young people, has made digital storytelling an important part of the modern communications mix. In 2022 UNICEF took advantage of this opportunity by employing a TikTok to showcase mental health campaigns and other youth-focused content.
 
Climate Action for Children: By introducing carbon finance mechanisms, UNICEF's Eco-Zone initiative achieved a triple win: financial innovation to direct extra funding toward households and municipalities; technological advancement with the creation of accessible stoves that meet robust standards; and market strengthening through private sector support for post-installation services.
Social Protection: To increase impact and strengthen coordination in implementing cash transfers in emergency situations, UNICEF led inter-agency efforts in developing a Joint Humanitarian Cash Programming Framework. This innovative mechanism brings government and humanitarian agencies together to align aid delivery with local needs while creating synergistic opportunities that benefit both communities and local government alike.
 
Child-Friendly Governance: UNICEF has started a new collaboration with the Ministry of Finance to set up an Economic Innovation Lab with a focus on developing innovative public finance strategies and solutions, particularly benefiting the social sector
 
Gender equality and social inclusion: In order to ensure equity, gender parity and observe social norms in a more holistic manner, it is vital to adopt an approach of comprehensive planning through intensified community engagement coupled with the utilization of localized research findings, embedding human-centred designs within relevant ministries while simultaneously reinforcing regulatory frameworks devised by provincial directorates as well as local authorities.

SAR,Pakistan,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"     
Health
  Hybrid modalities combining virtual and face-to-face workshop methods helped  in mitigating convening constraints during the emergency flood response and  contributed to the continuation of the National New-Born Strategy  development. Huge efficiency gains were achieved through this hybrid working  modality which enabled meaningful engagement with  Government and other partners to deliver results for children within a  complex working environment and humanitarian settings.
  
  
In  2022, the child health and innovation of UNICEF HQ and Supply Division were  critical to guide and review the oxygen therapy management national  guidelines; building national public sector capacity to accelerate progress in the long run. 
   
  Nutrition
  Reviving the LHW  programme for the delivery of expanded integrated packages of community  health and nutrition services in 10 Union Councils of District Quetta,  Balochistan, enabled the Government to increase the cost-effectiveness in  reaching families and communities by avoiding duplication of services and  efforts. The trained 250 LHWs and Lady Health Supervisors are now able to deliver  messages on Immunization, nutrition, WASH, MIYCN and KFCPs. We learned that  this initiative is scalable provided that proper training and support is  provided. 
  
  
ECD
  As an innovation to increase access and cost efficiency, UNICEF engaged the  Internet of Good Things Pakistan - IoGT Pakistan (goodinternet.org) -  Frontline Worker Resources - IoGT Pakistan (goodinternet.org) online platform  for KFCPs during training and for wider dissemination among health workers  which was successful in increasing awareness and promote self-paced learning.
  
  
WASH
  The UNICEF global approach and shift towards climate resilient WASH tallies  well with government priorities under the Climate Change agenda, especially  under the advocacy theme of ‘Children of Pakistan cannot wait, take climate  action now’. This has led to strategic government engagement and understanding  of UNICEF support and programs. The 2022 floods further demonstrated the need  for climate resilient WASH programming which touches on the broader  initiative of helping communities adapt to climate change. A significant  learning in 2022 is that WASH infrastructure should adapt better to changing  weather patterns and be able to withstand the increasingly prevalent extreme  weather events. 
  
  
Education
  UNICEF’s  prepositioning of education supplies, along with its humanitarian leadership through  the Education Sector Working Group, and ability to leverage its development  program and resources ensured an agile and rapid response. UNICEF’s TLCs saw  the enrolment of first-time learners. Registration of these children through  UNICEF support provided key data to the Government to ensure retention of  these children in school. Innovative solutions initiated during the floods such  as Gadi (three-wheeler) schools and mobile learning centers ensured  continuity of learning and provided a sense of normalcy to children  traumatized by the floods.
  
  
Child  Protection
  It was seen in Balochistan that an integrated approach for scaling up the child  protection case management and referral system, with long term, sustainable  technical support to the Social Welfare Department for Social Service work  force capacity building, service delivery improvement, awareness raising, and  promotion of CP services increases practicality and manageability of child  protection. 
  
  
Adapting  already tested approaches, materials, and tools related to COVID-19 and  Refugee Response Plan (RRP) helped to speed up implementation and reach children in the early phase of the flood response, such as design of a family  wellbeing kit with simple materials to support a family to cope with  displacement and loss, and existing Child Protection in Emergencies (CPIE)  message bank. These approaches will be institutionalized to sustainably increase resilience of service delivery.
  
Disaster  Risk Management
  
The  importance of emergency preparedness, particularly with the increased risk of  extreme weather events due to climate change, was made evident through the  historic monsoon floods. UNICEF was able to respond quickly due to its strong  preparedness but was still overwhelmed by the scale of the disaster. Given Pakistan's existing vulnerability, and additional  increasing risk of extreme weather events, scaling up response capacity will  be crucial, including increased prepositioning of supplies, human resources and expanded  partnerships. 
  
Social Policy
  
In 2022, UNICEF Pakistan learned that a lack of capacity,  skills, knowledge and awareness of disability issues, the cross-sectoral  nature of disability programming, and limited coordination between sections  led to limited inclusion of disability issues in programming. Moving forward,  a Disability Task Force within UNICEF will ensure a systematic approach to  capacity build with Disability Focal Points in all sections on programming,  targeted initiatives and programmatic indicators, and improved coordination. 
    
Adolescent  Development and Participation/GenU
  Ensuring equitable distribution of funds to support the new geographic  prioritization of the most deprived districts of the country will require a  considerable amount of additional funding. UNICEF will build on the strategic  provincial partnerships (with GPE and EU) in Punjab, KP and Balochistan, to  cover all districts and provinces to focus on intersectoral ADAP  programming. 
  
  
Advocacy  and Communication 
  The Pakistan country office achieved significant growth on social media,  generating 473 million impressions and 45 million video views in 2022. The  number of followers increased by 100 per cent on Twitter (220,000 followers),  25 percent on Facebook (900,000) and remained stable on Instagram (170,000).  This was achieved through the continued implementation of the 2018-2022  Advocacy, Communication and Social Mobilization strategy, and production of  27 events, 80 videos, 12 stories, 13 press releases, 3 Geneva Palais  briefings, and organized several visits for the regional and global directors  and several National Committees. The number of posts published in Urdu increased and supported increasing nation-wide reach.
         
Moving forward
Lessons learned will be taken forward into the new 2023-2027 Pakistan Country Program and related strategies. 

"
SAR,"ROSA, Nepal",Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The crises in SAR revealed the need to expand the understanding of market-based food system solutions and legal measures as well as strengthen emergency nutrition preparedness in addition to rapidly scale-up response capacities and enhance regional collaboration. The nutrition landscape is changing and the evolving nature of child malnutrition demands a multifaceted response including the need for new thinking and new strategic partnerships¿. An innovation in building local institutional capacity for nutrition included the identification of reputable in-country academic institutes to serve as nutrition national centres of excellence. A select few are being nurtured and networked to play a larger role for south-south collaboration and building a South Asia academic network to provide policy support throughout the region. 
 
The sudden developments in Pakistan (floods) and Sri Lanka (economic crisis) demonstrated the need for enhanced cross-sectoral analysis at both inter- and intra-agency levels to improve early warning and support information-led decision-making. In addition, the simultaneous and massive ongoing emergencies in various countries highlighted the need for continued collaboration between the emergency and programme sections to ensure prioritisation of emergency preparedness and response is built into section workplans. 
 
In the area of health, the approaches of zero-dose catch-ups, enhancing out-reach, integrated campaigns with focus on underserved and unreached children helped move toward the recovery of routine immunization and health systems. Understanding of community perceptions and the evidence-based, targeted interventions enhanced access to missed children and communities.
 
The need for tangible programming beyond youth engagement is clear as is the need to develop a stronger narrative of UNICEF as a credible partner in climate and environment. As such ROSA defined four strategic pillars for programming in climate, environment and energy namely: air quality; renewable energy; urban environmental degradation and waste management; and innovative financing mechanisms for disaster risk reduction, preparedness and response. A review of climate-resilient WASH activities revealed that the narrative around climate-resilient WASH demands more clarity with a need for stronger communication of what is different from conventional WASH programmes and services. The shift to climate-resilient WASH programming has had positive results, particularly with the use of renewable energy for low carbon sustainable operation of WASH facilities and services. 
 
There is mounting evidence of the long-term impact of COVID-19 and humanitarian disasters on the increased rates of child marriage and child labour including the fact that significant numbers of children especially girls are not returning to school¿ given the long-term economic impact on households such as increased debt and unemployment. The need for intersectoral collaboration is even more critical in order to accelerate results including for MHPSS, online protection, child marriage and child labour in both development and humanitarian contexts. The approaches of zero-dose catch-ups to “reach the unreached” in addition to enhancing outreach and integrated campaigns with a focus on the underserved populations has contributed tremendously towards the recovery of routine immunization in the region. 
 
Emergencies and climate-induced disasters in 2022 highlighted the need for ever closer alignment of communication, advocacy and fundraising efforts in collaboration with programme sections and headquarters; and have shown that emergencies remain significant opportunities to build brand trust and affinity for longer term influence and income opportunities, including through the SAR Income Hub. ¿Furthermore, meaningful stories that are driven by in-depth knowledge of our digital communities' expectations, needs and priorities (""right content at the right time"") and are aligned to organizational goals is critical for UNICEF to carve out its niche in an increasingly saturated, fast-moving and disruptive digital landscape, ultimately solidifying our position as the go-to organization for children and youth. ¿There is also the clear importance of linking children’s needs to wider priorities and narrative within the region¿. ¿Working through national thinktanks to create spaces for thought leaders to discuss children’s needs is one way to address this need. ROSA has promoted the space for national dialogue convening high-level researchers and experts from key think-tanks to discuss the implication of COVID-19 and the economic crisis on children in the region. 
 
ROSA will continue to provide technical leadership, oversight and quality assurance support to COs and continue to promote the centrality of children’s rights to adopt innovative programmatic approaches and cross-cutting strategies. Emerging areas will receive more focus such as climate action, digital transformation, zero-dose children, parenting and learning loss recovery, all to close the gaps for households at risk of being left behind. 
"
SAR,Sri Lanka,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Using short-term emergency responses to bring about system level changes
In response to the worsening economic crisis, UNICEF supported nutrition-sensitive short-term cash transfers for lactating women. In collaboration with the Colombo Municipal Council and Sarvodaya, a local civil society organisation, UNICEF initiated a pilot in Colombo, providing Sri Lankan Rupees 5,000 (USD 14) per month for up to three months to 3,010 registered mothers with a total of 3,044 babies aged six months or below. With additional funding secured, the programme is being scaled up to around 110,000 families with young children (5 to 24 months) in the most vulnerable districts in terms of severe child wasting. Based on careful analysis of different response options, UNICEF opted to work with the Government to collect beneficiary data, while providing the cash transfer through UNICEF’s own Financial Service Provider (FSP) and partnering with Sarvodaya on ensuring Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP), including the establishment of effective complaint and feedback mechanisms. 
 
A key feature of this programme is its aim to strengthen the overall national social protection system, through its programme design, delivery mechanisms and data collection systems. For instance, post-distribution monitoring was included in the pilot design, helping UNICEF collect valuable information on beneficiary preferences, such as for cash over vouchers as it increased their choices. This preference was further highlighted through a U-Report poll on an individual’s choice to buy food and related food prices, indicating that the transfer value was inadequate. These insights used to advocate with Government for key social protection system changes and universal child benefits and to put in place mechanisms that strengthen response capacities, such as a long-term agreement with a Financial Service Provider (FSP) and a strengthened AAP approach. This initiative highlighted a key learning that even a short-term emergency response pilot can be designed to bring about longer-term system level changes with a much larger impact for children across the country.   
 
Engaging private sector in digital transformations in education 
The COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing economic crisis have worsened disparities in learning and skills development. Prolonged school closures and the digital divide – in connectivity, access to devices, digital skills and contents – have deprived the most vulnerable groups from continuous learning. One key bottleneck is the lack of a sustainable strategy or financing for scaling up and mainstreaming distance and blended learning. Teachers and parents lack sufficient knowledge and capacities to support children with distance learning, which is further challenged by limited availability of hardware. Recognising this, UNICEF signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Dhammika Perera Foundation to provide 100 schools with high quality digital content, including e-lessons on various core subjects in the national school curriculum, in Sinhala, Tamil and English languages. This private sector partnership marked the start of several digital transformation initiatives by UNICEF and is mobilizing critical private sector support to bridge the digital divide for the most marginalized students and schools. This will help fill existing critical shortages of subject teachers, such as English and Mathematics, while longer-term measures, such as teacher re-deployment plans, are under review. The early impacts from this timely and valuable partnership are a learning for the office that engaging the private sector is key for taking forward digital transformations in education, particularly in a fiscally constrained environment, and critical in building higher levels of resilience through technology.
 
Operational effectiveness for programme delivery
The economic crisis brought about 10 to 12-hour daily power cuts to preserve electricity and restrictions on fuel due to severe shortages. This had a huge impact on the CO as it relied on diesel for backup power for critical infrastructure, such as telecom and internet provision. This meant the CO would have to limit the number of hours it could run the generator, affecting staff who could also not work from home due to the power cuts and internet disruptions. Given that staff were heavily engaged in providing urgent humanitarian responses to the crisis and for reasons of security and business continuity, the office had to be innovative in finding solutions to the challenges it faced. The operations team immediately acted, providing power banks for all staff and a phone and SIM card to the Crisis Management team to ensure continuous connectivity and setting up a new business continuity site at the Representative’s residence. The office mobilised additional resources from the Regional Office Contingency Fund to cover these expenses. While the Government made arrangements to provide diplomatic missions and international organizations with a continuous supply of fuel, this was not working effectively and heavily impacted the emergency response and life-saving support provided by the UN agencies. This prompted the UN Operations Management Team to collectively request for increased fuel allocations for UN agencies to implement emergency related activities from the Ministry of Power and Energy; the request is currently under review. The demand for critically needed medicines during the crisis with accelerated lead times required surge support in the Supply section to manage the increased workload and multiple complex requests from the MoH. Despite concerted efforts by the CO to ensure timely delivery, global supply-chain challenges compounded by flight delays due to the fuel crisis affected the delivery timelines of offshore procurements. However, the ability of UNICEF’s 
Operations Unit to be agile and innovative in addressing country context challenges has enabled the effective delivery of programmes, with minimal disruptions, in a time of crisis and chaos in the country. 
 
The CO has taken into consideration these lessons learned in the design of its new country programme commencing in 2023. The new country programme highlights a stronger humanitarian-development nexus, integrating responses and services that safeguard children in the short-term and mitigate a worsening situation, while also supporting the State to recover and expand services in the medium term. UNICEF will also increase its engagement with the private sector in the delivery of services. Enhanced operational effectiveness will remain critical for both the crisis response and development programmes, particularly in addressing global supply chain related challenges during a period of ongoing crisis.

WCAR,Benin,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Leçons apprises
Les alliances stratégiques avec des partenaires clés de l’UNICEF, tels que les Pays Bas, les Etats Unis, le Japon, l’Allemagne, la Suisse, l’Union Européenne et le Canada, sont cruciales et devraient être maintenues. Ces partenariats ont permis un accroissement significatif des ressources financières du bureau en 2022 avec plus de USD73 Millions mobilisés, soit une augmentation de USD69 millions par rapport à 2021. Les efforts de plaidoyer ont également abouti à un engagement plus soutenu du Gouvernement pour l’accélération de l’éducation des filles, la transformation en profondeur du système éducatif et la prise en compte par les pouvoirs publics des solutions socio-économiques adaptées dans les zones affectées et/ou à risque.
Le shift programmatique engagé par l’UNICEF en début d’année avec l’appui du bureau régional et de celui du Burkina Faso et l’activation du L2 ont permis à l’UNICEF d’être l’une des agences les mieux préparées dans le lien entre le développement et l’humanitaire, et une des plus agiles et rapides pour apporter une assistance aux personnes affectées dans les zones à risque, de manière systémique et holistique et en partenariat avec les ONG, les acteurs locaux et les jeunes.
Le positionnement stratégique de l’UNICEF pour l’opérationnalisation de la nouvelle politique de santé communautaire du Bénin constitue une opportunité de plaidoyer et un levier, important pour l’engagement de l’ensemble des parties prenantes en soutien au renforcement du système de santé.
Le renforcement des capacités de la Direction Générale du Budget en matière d’analyse budgétaire a permis de générer des évidences sur les actions à sensibilité sociale dans le budget de l’Etat. Cette appropriation pourrait permettre au Ministère des Finances d’appuyer d’autres ministères sectoriels à produire des notes budgétaires. Grâce à l’investissement fait dans le domaine des finances publiques pour les enfants, l’UNICEF a contribué à faire du Bénin un pays champion en transparence budgétaire et en participation citoyenne et un modèle en matière de dépenses sociales, qui ont atteint 43,8% des dépenses de l’Etat en 2022 contre 40,8% en 2021.
Les résultats atteints par le programme multisectoriel « Cash+ Care » autour de l’éducation des adolescent.es combinés aux interventions autour de la santé et du bien-être des adolescent.es ont permis à l’UNICEF de mettre les adolescent.es au cœur des interventions de tous les programmes et de renforcer la multisectorialité autour du droit des filles. 
Enfin, l’engagement des enfants, des adolescent.es et des jeunes en tant qu’agents de changement restent des facteurs déterminants au changement social. L’implication des parents, des leaders communautaires et des enseignants et des comités villageois de veille contre les VFE et les VBG, permettent d’améliorer l’environnement familial et communautaire pour la protection des enfants et la réalisation de leurs droits.
Des points focaux sur la gestion des connaissances ont été désignés dans chaque section afin de mettre en œuvre la Stratégie de gestion des connaissances à moyen terme de l’UNICEF et renforcer la documentation des bonnes pratiques.
Innovations
L’engagement consistant auprès du Gouvernement pour le passage à l’échelle d’initiatives pilotes comme Vaxyrappel, plateforme permettant de rappeler le calendrier vaccinal des enfants aux mamans par SMS, a permis de passer à une appropriation nationale intégrée dans la stratégie e-Santé du Ministère de la Santé, avec un paquet large couvrant la vaccination, le suivi de la femme enceinte et de l’enfant de zéro à cinq ans.
La réforme des centres de promotion sociale, qui seront transformés en guichet unique de protection sociale, est à la fois une innovation et une mutation apportée au système de protection au Bénin pour rendre les services et les prestations plus accessibles aux populations. L’UNICEF a également appuyé le Ministère des Affaires Sociales pour le développement de deux plateformes digitales sur la cartographie géolocalisée des acteurs du secteur social et la gestion des centres d’accueil et de protection des enfants, pour une meilleure coordination des acteurs et l’amélioration des conditions de vie des enfants dans les CAPE. 
La solution « IRELCA », qui vise à partager des messages clés sur la santé sexuelle et reproductive à travers le jeu de Ludo, a été retenue comme l’une des neuf solutions sélectionnées au niveau mondial pour être incubées dans le cadre du ""Challenge Spark Incubator"" de l’UNICEF. Fruit de la collaboration entre les sections Politiques Sociales et Survie à travers le projet UPSHIFT, elle a été développée directement par sept adolescentes. Parmi les solutions développées figurent également la production d’«Ignorance», la première sériée télévisée entièrement écrite, produite et réalisée par des adolescents au Bénin sur les grossesses précoces, le harcèlement sexuel et l’avortement. En termes de perspective, il s’agira de solliciter l’accompagnement financier d’investisseurs et de partenaires pour la mise à échelle des solutions développées par les adolescentes à travers le projet UPSHIFT.
Le partenariat public-privé-jeunes sur le programme Acteurs de Changement 229 a permis d’élargir le réseau de partenaires de l’UNICEF engagés pour la formation et l’emploi des jeunes. Cette approche a démontré l’intérêt du secteur privé pour offrir des opportunités concrètes aux jeunes mais a soulevé des limitations en termes d’inclusion, au niveau géographique comme de genre – la majorité des participants étant des hommes, basés dans le Sud du Bénin. Au regard du manque criard d’opportunités de développement des compétences dans le Nord du Bénin, une nouvelle édition d’Acteurs de Changement 229 focalisée sur les zones frontalières sera lancée début 2023 avec pour objectif d’atteindre au moins 50% de femmes. La plateforme YOMA sera lancée au Bénin pour valoriser l’engagement des jeunes et faciliter l’accès aux opportunités de formation.
Dans un contexte économique, sécuritaire, sanitaire et climatique aux multiples défis, et en anticipation du nouveau Programme de coopération 2024-2028, l’UNICEF s’inscrit dans une dynamique de renforcement des systèmes pour assurer la continuité des services sociaux essentiels pour les enfants et leurs familles, à travers une mobilisation stratégique des partenaires nationaux et internationaux, et une participation renforcée des acteurs locaux et des jeunes dans le plaidoyer et la mise en œuvre des interventions pour la cohésion sociale, le respect et la réalisation des droits de l’enfant, des filles en particulier."
WCAR,Burkina Faso,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lessons Learned  
     
National-level coordination remains essential in converging partners  around shared-value actions to boost progress for the most vulnerable children  and women across sectors. This is also critical in terms of creating  opportunities to advocate for more investments in the social dimensions of the  SDGs within the relevant national sectoral strategies and plans.     The use of Community Health Workers (CHWs) and young people was  instrumental in ensuring the continuity of immunization, nutrition, and birth  registration services in crisis-affected regions in a context marked by  COVID-19 and limited humanitarian space. This has contributed to improving the quality of healthcare  services from a multisectoral perspective. CHWs have played a critical role in  mobilizing men to provide support to pregnant women for their care in health facilities,  but above all, they have worked to transform gender roles and norms to enable  women to decide for themselves when and how to demand healthcare services  without being restricted by their husbands or family members. CHWs therefore remained  the cornerstone of population resilience by ensuring access to health  services in a context marred by the closure of many health facilities.      The implementation of CLTS in emergency in IDP sites, host communities  and peri-urban areas facilitated social cohesion and peace building. The  empowerment of local artisans in conjunction with communal focal points facilitated  the acceleration of the implementation of WASH activities in insecure areas,  as well as water trucking by tricycle/animal traction, and the integration of  women and young people in training on handpump maintenance in hard-to-reach  areas.     The integrated package of interventions and the remote programming  approach boosts UNICEF’s equity agenda as it enables the organization to  reach more vulnerable children in hard-to-reach and enclaved areas. The  engagement of local actors resulted in improved synergy between local  authorities and communities regarding the issue of access to equitable essential  services by the most vulnerable people. More specifically, community  engagement with active and dedicated young people helps accelerate the  localization and nexus agenda as it brings more local solutions to the  evolving humanitarian context.    Social Innovations  The introduction of MMS into antenatal care services for pregnant  women, which was initiated in two health districts demonstrated improved adherence  of women and enabled good coverage of services, compared to iron folate  supplementation. From the field perspective, MMS is a learning by doing  initiative. It is considered as a social innovation that makes ANC  community-based platforms more gender-responsive using women’s feedback.     The deterioration of the security situation has reduced access to the  formal education system, which requires urgent measures to scale up  alternative education models based on the potential of digital technology to  provide solutions to the needs of isolated children who have remained in crisis  affected areas. The Radio Education Programme implemented by UNICEF has  therefore been instrumental in providing an educational routine for out of  school children while they wait for a return to normalcy. Given the protracted  nature of the humanitarian crisis, it is essential to adapt this programme  curriculum to make it a more relevant alternative to independent learning in  the future.     Another successful example of innovative programming was the  partnership between UNICEF, WFP, MENAPLN and EDUCO which provided catch-up  classes (including school feeding) for 15,000 OOSC children/dropouts during  the summer vacation, allowing them to gain a one level of learning with the  opportunity to be re-integrated in the education system at the start of the  new school year.   "
WCAR,Cabo Verde,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the effects of the war between Russia and Ukraine, highlighted the need for coordinated and integrated interventions to deal with this type of crisis. Thus, at the level of the Joint Office, the program approach and joint action, allow the three agencies to respond jointly and in an integrated manner to the various appeals launched by the Government of Cabo Verde in the context of combating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the effects of the war between Russia and Ukraine, with serious repercussions on the food security of the most vulnerable populations, including children and adolescents. 
It is also worth mentioning the leadership assumed by government authorities in partnership with development partners, particularly SNU agencies, in implementing the social protection and socio-economic measures taken by the Government. In the field of social protection, the coordination of actions, particularly regarding the resources mobilization for food security is an example of good practices that should be extended to other areas. In the field of education, the opportunities taken by national authorities to introduce mechanisms for alternative and innovative education, with emphasis on the implementation of digital learning methods, highlight the opportunities to promote inclusion and ensure that no one is left behind, even in an adverse context characterized by the COVID-19 pandemic and armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Another excellent lesson learned has to do with the continued promotion of dialogue with national partners and development partners, which made it possible to overcome administrative constraints and articulate with the EUROPE Union, Government of Luxembourg, World Bank, Spain and Portuguese cooperation in terms of planning and avoiding duplication or overlaps in the programmatic interventions.

WCAR,Central African Republic,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Localisation dans un contexte d’urgence : L’UNICEF a continué à étendre progressivement la localisation dans un contexte d’urgence, pour renforcer son efficacité opérationnelle, tout en s’acquittant de son engagement dans le cadre du Grand Bargain. Le partenariat avec la Coordination Diocésaine de la santé CODIS, une ONG locale, a permis de mettre en place un projet d'assistance humanitaire mobile multisectorielle en faveur des déplacés qui ne pouvaient pas être atteints par les autres partenaires en raison de problèmes d'accès. Dans le secteur de la WASH, le partenariat avec des associations d'artisans réparateurs de pompe d’eau permet que les petites réparations soient effectuées directement par la coopérative. Ces expériences prometteuses de localisation seront étendues dans le cadre du nouveau programme 2023-2027, notamment en facilitant un plus grand nombre de partenariat avec des organisations locales.
Complémentarité intersectorielle pour des résultats plus durables pour les enfants : En ligne avec la stratégie du nouveau programme 2023-2027, l’accent dans les programmes d’éducation a été mis, déjà en 2022, sur des paquets d’interventions intégrées éducation- protection – WASH – et Changement social et comportemental (SBC), en vue de fournir aux élèves de plus de 100 écoles ciblées le minimum requis pour un apprentissage de qualité. Ces paquets sont contextualisés et permettent d’assurer que les écoles sont construites/réhabilitées, les équipements scolaires disponibles, avec des latrines séparées ; les enseignants sont formés, y compris en appui psycho-social, et des kits scolaires et kits récréatifs permettent aux élèves d’être bien équipés pour apprendre. Les filles reçoivent des kits d’hygiènes, et les élèves qui en ont besoin, des actes de naissance (à travers des jugements supplétifs), afin de réduire les facteurs d’abandon. Le dialogue communautaire, l’éducation accélérée et les clubs « Education par la radio » complètent ces efforts, permettant un résultat plus élevé et durable, sans oublier les filles et les enfants laissés pour compte. Avec la réduction des opportunités de financement pour le pays, cette approche de paquet intégré multisectoriel utilisant comme porte d’entrée un secteur dont le financement est relativement prédictible, sera une des stratégies clés pour financer l’agenda Nexus de l’UNICEF dans le prochain cycle de programme.
Plaidoyer réussi dans le domaine de l’éducation: Le soutien apporté au ministère de l’éducation dans le choix des priorités clés présentées par le Président lors du sommet de New York a été essentiel pour garantir l'orientation stratégique du secteur. Des engagements concrets ont été pris par le gouvernement, concernant notamment l'importance des enseignantes femmes, de l'allocation budgétaire interne, et de l'engagement communautaire ainsi que la nécessité de résoudre la crise de l'apprentissage. La collaboration s’est poursuivie avec la Banque Mondiale, l’Agence française de développement (AFD), et l’Ambassade de France, entre autres, pour appuyer l’élaboration d’un nouveau curriculum pour le préscolaire, le primaire et le secondaire et pour un plaidoyer coordonné auprès du ministère de l’éducation sur la question du déploiement des enseignants. Ces approches coordonnées ont donné l'occasion d'influencer l'orientation stratégique du secteur pour les années à venir.
Les nouvelles technologies pour amplifier la voix des bénéficiaires : Dans le cadre de la redevabilité aux populations affectées (AAP), l’UNICEF a collaboré avec le PAM et OCHA pour digitaliser le système de plaintes et de feedback  en vue de renforcer l’anonymat et la traçabilité des plaintes. Avec la mise en service de l’application ETC-Connect, le nombre de plaintes prises en charge en 2022 a nettement augmenté par rapport aux années précédentes, passant de 7,638 plaintes prises en charge contre 421 en 2021. Par rapport à 2021, l’engagement digital, d’UNICEF en RCA s’est traduit par une croissance de 195.4% au niveau des visites de la page Facebook, soit 8,000 visites en 2022. Le nombre de followers sur Twitter a franchi les 10,000, augmentant de manière exponentielle la visibilité des programmes de l’UNICEF et de ses généreux donateurs.
Atteindre le dernier kilomètre dans un contexte de pénurie de carburant : En 2022, le pays a  connu une pénurie de carburant sans précèdent due à la guerre en Ukraine. Ce problème couplé à l’insécurité aurait pu causer l’arrêt temporaire des activités du bureau et par conséquent priver les enfants des services dont ils ont besoin. Pour y faire face, l’UNICEF a tiré profit de la collaboration inter-agence dans le cadre du BOS (Business Operations Strategy) ainsi que de partenariats avec les fournisseurs locaux pour éviter tout épuisement des réserves, assurant ainsi, la continuité des opérations sur le terrain. En outre, le bureau a mis en place une petite station pour desservir les véhicules à Bangui et deux cuves de 30,000 litres pour le bureau de Bangui et de Kaga Bandoro.
Vers la transition écologique de l’UNICEF en RCA : L’UNICEF en RCA a amorcé sa transformation écologique avec l’installation du système de panneaux solaires dans les locaux de Kaga Bandoro. L’installation est prévue en 2023 au niveau de deux autres bureaux de zone (Bambari et Bouar) avec le financement reçu du Greening fund. Par ailleurs, le bureau s’est inscrit comme pays pilote dans le projet « solution globale de gestion de la flotte » permettant ainsi de réduire l'empreinte carbone de la flotte automobile."
WCAR,Chad,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The lessons learned generated in 2022 from the current UNDAF, UNICEF CPD 2017–2021/ext.2023, KRC and other programmatic evaluations highlighted a number of key strategic shifts that the Office will be pursuing in 2023 as it prepares the transition to the new CPD 2024–2026 and revises its theory of change. 

Lessons learned 1:
Synergy between the programme components is favoured when it is thought out from the design of the programme (CPD Evaluation).
To illustrate: KRC1: Integration of SBC strategies into the COVID-19 vaccination campaign allowed to raise awareness of over 6 million people, contributing to a ten-fold increase in vaccination coverage.
Strategic shift 1: Design and scale up integrated programming across a maximum of KRC to achieve synergy, cost-effectiveness and sustainability.

Lessons learned 2:
The implementation of the community-based approach promotes the engagement of communities in the uptake of basic social services/maintenance of infrastructure and the removal of access bottlenecks, especially for women and girls (CPD Evaluation) and the involvement and commitment of traditional leaders is a success factor for achieving rapid, at-scale results (KRC7 Evaluation and KRC8 Evaluation).
To illustrate:
KRC3&4: The training of 6,160 members of local school management committees (including women) on the importance of education (especially girls’ education) and the management of school infrastructures (including latrines) to foster community engagement and accountability, enabled a local increase in education demand and quality. 
KRC8: The involvement of community leaders as well as associations led by youth (including adolescent girls) and women in the cantonal-based scale-up of CLTS accelerated results in ending open defecation almost three-fold in 2021 and 2022 while promoting community dialogue and preventing conflict.
Strategic shift 2. Prioritize decentralized and community-based approaches, localization and community and youth engagement and accountability to rights-holders and communities, through the gender-transformative approach at the centre as a lever of sustainable change.

Lessons learned 3:
Inter-agency collaboration and collaboration with key actors allows for combined efforts and investments in advocacy to strengthen the capacities of national authorities for scale-up and avoidance of duplication of interventions (KRC7 Evaluation).  
To illustrate: KRC7: Inter-agency UNICEF-UNHCR-UNDP collaboration resulted in the validation of the roadmap for accelerating universal BR in Chad. Furthermore, UNICEF-UNHCR collaboration enabled to provide birth certificates to 131,717 refugees and internally displaced people.
Strategic shift 3. Strengthen investment in priority KRCs by focusing on creating synergy with other agencies and partners for scale-up and innovative approaches for locally-owned solutions.

Lessons learned 4:
When interventions target both host communities and refugees/displaced populations, they are more conducive to peace and improve social cohesion and resilience-building (UNDAF Evaluation, CPD Evaluation).
To illustrate: The set-up of AAP in the internally displaced sites and refugee camps enabled 474,864 people to provide feedback on the humanitarian assistance required for both displaced and host households, reducing tensions between the two groups. 
Strategic shift 4: Strengthen the triple nexus (humanitarian action-development-peace) programming approach as the main entry point to ensuring sustainable and inclusive development.

Lessons learned 5:
Routine data collection enables the monitoring of indicators and the regular tracking of results (UNDAF Evaluation).
To illustrate: KRC7: As a result of routine data collection set up in 2021 by the Ministry of Territorial Administration with support from UNICEF, civil registration centres regularly collected and reported monthly data, which together with BR through the one-stop centres, led to a 4-percentage point increase in BR between 2021 and 2022.
Strategic shift 5: Reinforce UNICEF's technical assistance to strengthen statistical data systems and its advocacy role vis-à-vis the Government in monitoring the situation of children and fulfilling reporting obligations.

Lessons learned 6:
A good analysis of the environment (e.g. difference in the situation of rural and urban youth) in which interventions are implemented allows to address development challenges in a context-appropriate and transformative manner (PBF Evaluation).
To illustrate: The surveys conducted by UNICEF among 9,204 young people (24 per cent girls) in 2022 through U-Report to gather information on their differentiated needs and challenges enabled the Office to have critical information to continue adapting the CPD to the specific risks and vulnerabilities facing children.
Strategic shift 6. Strengthen the context-specific analysis and programming for adapted engagement of young people and adolescents, especially adolescent girls, as agents of change, including for the achievement of the KRC.

Lessons learned 7:
The root causes of the persistent humanitarian situation cannot be sustainably addressed in the context of limited access to basic services, environmental degradation and climate change, which exacerbate vulnerabilities, add pressure on services and resources, creating tensions and conflicts (Emergency Response Evaluation).
To illustrate: In 2022, UNICEF ensured nexus-focused programming to broaden access to basic social services while relying on CC-proofing and technology-driven and resilient infrastructure such as solar-panel-powered water systems.
Strategic shift 7. Strengthen systems by ensuring more sustainable and climate-resilient design and provision of basic social services.

As we move forward into the new CPD 2024–2026, the Office will be intensifying and scaling up its innovations, including: distance learning launched during COVID-19 in partnership with the Government and national NGO, which allowed to reach over 1 million school-age children (33 per cent) and is set to become a key strategy for the next Education Plan to fill the gaps in KRC3 and KRC4; the human-centred design and interoperability between health and BR with the integrated immunization and BR approach ""Kulina Sawa"", which has resulted in the vaccination of 13,729 zero-dose and dropout children, and the registration of 3,318 children despite the service delivery barriers initially identified in two pilot provinces, paving the way for greater synergy in the delivery of KRC1 and KRC7; the one-stop digital BR platform ""Tasdjil"", which has enabled the registration of 2,050 one-year-old children in a few months and is set to take BR results to national scale in no time; and the scaling up of youth platforms, including  the Super Banat group for girls on reproductive health issues, the young voices of the Sahel on climate action, and the U-Reporters, the latter of which have crossed the 1 million milestone and positioned Chad among the top seven countries worldwide.

WCAR,Congo,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
A suite de deux premières années de mise en œuvre du programme de coopération, marquées par la réponse à la COVID-19 et un afflux de financements pour la réponse humanitaire, le bureau a constaté lors de la revue annuelle de 2021 un besoin de rationaliser le nombre de priorités dans le Plan Annuel de Gestion (AMP), de prioriser la génération d’évidences probantes qui puissent être mis à l’échelle, et d’adapter la structure du programme afin d’avoir un meilleur suivi des résultats du programme par secteur. 
Aussi en concertation avec le bureau régional (WCARO), le bureau a revu le nombre des KRC et a proposé une réduction de cinq à quatre priorités, tout en gardant une contribution effective pour les autres KRC. Le bureau a aussi révisé la structure du programme dans Vision. Ceci a permis une redevabilité plus claire et accrue pour les résultats et la gestion des fonds par les officiers de programme.
Lors de la revue à mi-parcours du programme a confirmé sa théorie de changement et le focus sur le renforcement de l’environnement favorable, la capacité du Gouvernement à offrir des services sociaux de base de qualité, et l’augmentation de la demande de services par les bénéficiaires. Elle a aussi a permis d’identifier les axes de priorisation jusqu’à la fin du cycle, celles-ci étant l’immunisation ; l’amélioration de la qualité des soins avec l’intégration de la Prévention de la Transmission Mère-Enfant, la santé maternelle et les 1,000 premiers jours ; et une intégration des KRC4 et KRC5 autour de l’approche « apprendre en toute sécurité » dans un objectif de focaliser la contribution du bureau dans la réduction des violences à l’école et les violences basées sur le genre et en ligne, et de piloter les effets sur l’amélioration des résultats scolaires. 
En 2022, le bureau a piloté un modèle de gestion stratégique du district sanitaire en vue de l’amélioration de la qualité des soins primaires. Ce modèle avait pour objectif d’améliorer le pilotage stratégique des districts sanitaires grâce aux données de production et spécifiques adaptées à chaque contexte ; de rationnaliser l’utilisation des financements pour le Renforcement du Système de Santé centré sur la santé de la mère et de l’enfant et de réduire les couts de la non-qualité. Entre juillet et décembre 2022, la disponibilité des intrants pour les soins obstétricaux et néonataux est passée de 38% à 78% et le niveau de connaissance des fonctions Soins obstétricaux, néonataux, d’urgences de base est passée de 31% à 62.5%. Le facteur de succès a été l’utilisation d’une solution digitale qui a permis aux acteurs de visualiser les gaps, en faisant le lien avec les normes de soins et leur propre contribution à la performance du centre de santé ; et une approche centrée sur l’analyse des gaps par centre de santé intégré et par prestataire. Ceci a permis d’accroître la motivation des acteurs et de mieux cibler les éléments d’amélioration. 
Un autre projet pilote dans le cadre d’Apprendre en toute sécurité (KRC4 et KRC5), est la mise en œuvre d’un cadre de suivi scolaire à travers les comités de protection de l’enfant et les services des inspections de circonscriptions scolaires des zones cibles dans le département de la Lékoumou, qui ont permis l’augmentation du taux de rétention passant de 50% en 2020 à 80% en 2022. L’on a également gagné 7 points sur le taux de réussite aux examens d’état qui était de 49% en 2020 et de 56% en 2021-2022. Ces résultats contribuent à l’ODD 4 dont les indicateurs étaient faibles dans ce département.  
Concernant les politiques sociales, l'un des défis les plus importants pour le programme est la mobilisation des ressources, principalement domestiques, mais également des bailleurs, pour certaines thématiques. Pour 2023, le bureau continuera à produire des évidences et à s’engager dans le renforcement des capacités internes de l’UNICEF en matière de mise en œuvre des politiques budgétaires et le renforcement du partenariat avec le ministère en charge des finances et le parlement dans le processus de budgétisation et la promotion des budgets ouverts.
En 2022 le bureau a corrigé le faible taux d’investissements dans l’évaluation par la participation dans des initiatives régionales, tant au niveau des évaluations multi-pays que par l’introduction d’innovations telle que le « photo-voice ». Cette approche permet aux enfants et à la population en général d’exprimer leurs avis sur des avancées programmatiques à travers la photo. En 2023, cette approche contribuera à une planification participative avec les communautés ainsi que leur implication dans le suivi et l’évaluation programmatiques. 
Dès 2020, le bureau s’était marqué comme objectif d’augmenter la proportion des fonds transmis suivant la modalité Cash Transfert aux organisations de la société civile (OSC), qui était autour de 20%. En 2022, cette proportion a été de 27% pour les OSC.  Cependant, hors campagnes de vaccination en urgence et les fonds du Partenariat Mondial pour l’Education liées à COVID-19, cette proportion est de 46 % pour tous les autres DCT. Pour 2023, période où le bureau va diversifier les partenaires des OSC et réduire les risques liés aux transferts aux 20 partenaires à risque élevé ou significatif, dont 16 du Gouvernement.
Bâtissant sur les constatations lors de la revue annuelle 2022, pour 2023, il s’agira de continuer avec les prototypages, évaluations et partage des évidences dans le cadre de la stratégie de Gestion des connaissances du bureau, et de bâtir sur les innovations introduites en 2022. Ceci devrait permettre au bureau de renforcer le positionnement stratégique de l’UNICEF comme knowledge broker, de renforcer les évidences en vue du plaidoyer pour une augmentation des investissements de l’état dans les services sociaux de base, et renforcer la capacité des communautés à demander ces services par le renforcement des capacités et des processus de cocréation programmatique, de participation et d’écoute des populations. Ceci, devrait permettre au bureau de mobiliser les ressources nécessaires pour le programme et être mieux préparé pour accompagner le pays à affronter les défis du pays pour l’atteinte des ODD, tout en ne laissant aucun enfant pour compte. 

"
WCAR,Cote D'Ivoire,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"The cost of COVID-19 campaigns and the related risk of diverting part of the health workforce, to the detriment of other health interventions, led the country office to advocate successfully for the integration of COVID-19 vaccination into the routine immunization system, while continuing campaigns to boost routine immunization. Integrating other interventions, such as the ‘Polio +’ initiative and VAS-D, with COVID-19 campaigns was an innovative approach that contributed to enhancing the cost-effectiveness of child survival and development interventions and accelerating the regionally defined results for child immunization and stunting prevention. 
In response to the learning crisis, the country office enhanced the digital learning platform ‘My school at home’. During 2022 about 4,000 e-lessons were made available, along with quizzes and videos to ensure quality digital learning. Online videos included a window for sign-language translation, encouraging inclusive education. Although digital lessons and videos are quality tools for educational continuity during emergencies, the requirement of internet access means they pose a risk of increasing the digital divide. Thus, UNICEF held discussions with the government and private sector to ensure that no child is left behind. It introduced an SMS-based tool whose use   is not dependent on internet access. Teachers were sent a predefined text (‘dictation of the day’), adapted to different grade levels, via SMS or WhatsApp for classroom use. In 2022 about 3,000 teachers read the ‘dictation’ to 150,000 children in public, private, community and Islamic schools. The text, usually on children’s rights, was accompanied by a tutorial, a scoring grid and online data feedback, allowing teachers to get detailed results. Preliminary results showed that only 24 per cent of first graders could write the alphabet letters, which motivated teachers to develop adapted remedies. Use of the tool also motivated teachers by bringing them together as a community of practice. Digital education initiatives like this constitute an accelerator for KRCs related to equitable access to education and improved learning outcomes.
UNICEF’s partnership with Conceptos Plásticos continued to generate considerable interest from donors, notably through UNICEF National Committees. The production of plastic bricks stabilized in 2022 with the delivery of 192 kits (each containing enough bricks to build one classroom). In March 2022 storms with very high winds struck northern Cote d’Ivoire, damaging four schools built with recycled plastic bricks. UNICEF immediately responded by securing the school areas and setting up tents to host schoolchildren and their teachers, permitting continuity of education. UNICEF engineers assessed all buildings located in the high-risk area to verify their stability. As climate change advances it is expected that high winds and storms will increase in this region. The engineers found that classroom architecture needs technical improvements, notably regarding roofs, to ensure better resistance to high winds. The new school design will potentially impact the cost per school. 
The WASH sub-prefectural level approach created a positive competitive environment among villages and communities and accelerated the scaling-up of the CLTS approach. ODF promotion benefited from strong support by local authorities, particularly prefectural authorities, and resulted in meeting the country programme ODF target with 123,230 additional people living in newly certified ODF communities. This approach could be considered as an accelerator for regionally defined results related to eliminating open defecation.
When the ‘girl power’ programme enrolled new cohorts of girls, the capacity of the national civic service office (NCSO) to monitor quality and support integration of larger numbers into internships, jobs and entrepreneurship opportunities was found to be limited. In addition to strengthening the capacity of NCSO agents and the private sector, UNICEF innovated by setting up peer-to-peer coaching that leveraged the skills and experience of previous cohorts to support the current ones. This strengthened solidarity among the girls and enhanced their leadership skills. Peer coaching could become a key approach for advancing the Gen-U agenda and gender action plan.
Evaluation of interoperability mechanisms for birth registration revealed that involvement by maternity and immunization services had a positive impact, strengthening the link between communities and civil registration services. However, high staff turn-over, particularly in immunization services, calls for new methods of transferring knowledge and competencies to ensure continuity of services and accelerated progress toward achieving the related KRCs. 
During 2022 the security threat in northern regions created additional pressure on the social service workforce, which is limited in number and under multiple demands by partners. UNICEF support for strengthening the social workforce and providing mobile money for social centres was essential to ensure that children received necessary support and quality assistance by qualified social services. Setting up regional pools of champion social workers and civil registrars served as an important means to mobilize frontline workers to develop sectoral plans, by leveraging their commitment and expertise. It also supported UNICEF’s priorities on decentralization by engaging regional-level actors directly in the development of support mechanisms. These two approaches constituted an accelerator for regionally defined results related to protecting children from violence, including in humanitarian contexts. 
Despite serious efforts to actively train and engage girls and young women as ambassadors for peace, very few were active in creating awareness and co-organizing intergenerational dialogues for peace and social cohesion. Factors affecting their leadership are multi-dimensional, including illiteracy, unemployability, early pregnancy, lack of ID documents and social and gender norms.  There is a need to strengthen the ‘Young ambassadors for peace’ programme, including through collaboration and partnership with existing initiatives to improve the outcomes, particularly for girls and young women.
The decentralized semi-annual and annual review process by the field offices in Man and Korhogo, allowed the office to analyse progress in programme implementation in convergence zones and engage government and civil society at decentralized levels, reinforcing the “localized” approach and allowing communities to contribute national-level planning. 
The June 2022 publication of the Global Staff Survey and preceding PULSE surveys offered an opportunity for the office and the staff association to jointly organize small group meetings and wide consultations involving all staff, managers to address issues raised in the survey. This process allowed the office to have difficult conversations and practice ‘speak up’ culture.   "
WCAR,Democratic Republic of Congo,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In terms of lessons learned and innovations, “cash plus for children” and “adolescent girls’ agency and empowerment” have been amongst those interventions that UNICEF DRC will scale in 2023 considering their impactful results on children and adolescents. 
 
""Cash+ for children”
According to UNICEF’s Office of Research, Innocenti, evidence shows that cash transfers help the poorest and most vulnerable families meet their basic needs and generate a wide range of benefits such as increased household productive capacity, improved dietary diversity, and school attendance.
 
In 2022, UNICEF enhanced its internal capacity for managing cash-based interventions and rolled out 2 humanitarian cash programmes assisting 5,100 households (25,080 beneficiaries) with mobile money transfers in Tanganyika province. The first intervention was carried out in the health zone of Manono where UNICEF assisted 1,400 households through a Cash+ Nutrition program complementing malnutrition treatment with multipurpose cash transfers to avoid children relapsing back to malnutrition and improve households’ purchasing power and access to a healthy and nutritious diet. According to initial Post-Distribution Monitoring feedback provided by Third Party Monitoring partners, 90% of beneficiary households reported an increased number of meals for family members during the intervention and the malnutrition treatment cure rate reached 98%. 
 
The second intervention took place in another health zone, Mbulula, always in the same province. A total of 3,606 amongst the most vulnerable displaced population and host community households received multi-purpose cash through mobile money transfers to improve access to basic goods and services. As per the mid-term intervention analysis, 91% of households reported an increase in expenditure for children and 96% reported improvement in their overall conditions.
 
A more detailed evaluation of these promising results is expected in 2023. This will feed into the scale-up of this “Cash+ nutrition” programme with a wider geographical coverage and linkages with social protection schemes to transition from malnutrition treatment to prevention interventions for children.  UNICEF will expand this approach to other sectors in 2023, such as protection and health to maximize investments for the most vulnerable children.
 
Adolescent girls’ agency and empowerment
In November 2022, the first-ever DRC’s Girls Forum, brought together in Kinshasa 100 adolescent girls and young women from across DRC and other 12 African countries. 
 
More than a simple event, led under the slogan: I am here to be heard, the Forum was a unique moment of dialogue allowing the girls to speak freely, most for the first time, about the challenging situations they face daily, in their community, in their home and in their school. Sexual abuse was the most recurrent topic raised. Moving testimonies confirmed that sexual and gender-based violence is still used in DRC as a weapon of war and transactional and survival sex is common practice in humanitarian settings to meet basic needs. 
 
In addition to quality exchanges, the Forum was the platform for launching the premiere of the ""Vaillante"" in the DRC, a television and film production by UNICEF on child marriage to spark dialogue and build another narrative around child marriage in Africa.
 
The Forum was also the springboard for the launch of U-Report girls, a world first. Through a simple click via SMS, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, this platform allows girls to make their voices heard on the issues that particularly affect them and access information on women's issues, to help them make good decisions and ultimately act as champions for girls' rights in their communities. The launch of U-Report Girls is already having a fallout. In only a few weeks after its launch, the participation of girls on the platform rose from 33% to 36%, out of a total of more than 4.6 million registered U-Report users. 
 
The first U-Report Girls survey, selected by the girls themselves and launched in December 2022 with more than 69,000 participants was indeed on sexual violence. The platform and the survey results are also used by the Ministries of Youth and Sports amongst others, to inform policies, actions such as youth focus social services. "
WCAR,Equatorial Guinea,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Integrated response to COVID-19 
 
The CO strategically identified the USAID and the MPTF COVID-19 emergency funds as an opportunity to enhance the emergency-development nexus by strengthening the health system, particularly the vaccination programme, while improving emergency responsiveness. Using MPTF funds to address deficiencies identified in the cold chain equipment and staff capacity in logistics and maintenance will contribute to improving both routine and COVID-19 vaccination. Likewise, the IPC/WASH and RCCE interventions to prevent COVID-19 in targeted health facilities and schools will help prevent a broader range of infections. 
 
Both emergency projects required intersectoral implementation within UNICEF and with external counterparts. This meant strong coordination between various UNICEF sections (Health, Education, Monitoring and Evaluation, Communication, and the field office) as well as between the Ministries of Health and Education national and subnational authorities, which was at time challenging given they mostly work in silos. 
 
The MPTF-funded joint project for COVID-19 vaccination generated other lessons learned. The communication campaign to promote vaccination with donated Moderna vaccines could not occur because an incident happened during the African Immunization Week when adolescent girls in 10 schools in Bata reported various symptoms after being immunized against neo-natal tetanus and diphtheria (Td) with doses procured by UNICEF. Despite the scientific evidence obtained through the collective work of international and national experts proving that this situation was unrelated to the effects of the Td vaccine, the Government decided to suspend all vaccination campaigns, potentially damaging overall vaccination efforts. 
 
Nevertheless, working with WHO, having the RC's support, conducting high-level dialogue with the MoH, and providing timely and sound technical evidence of the rigorous vaccine management by UNICEF to different audiences were instrumental to revert a potential reputational risk and reorient the COVID-19 vaccination efforts. 
 
 
U-Report Advocacy 
 
UNICEF started developing high-level advocacy for the implementation of U-Report in 2019. It took intensive dialogue with stakeholders from different ministries to gain ownership and finally launch U-Report in December 2022. The main challenges were to avoid the perception of the potential misuse of U-Report for political or partisan purposes and to convince the government counterparts about the advantages of adolescents and young people’s participation in the country’s development. 
 
Several advocacy meetings were held with high-level ministers and meetings with technical teams in line ministries. A multi-sectoral steering committee for implementing U-Report, was finally established in November 2022. Likewise, the alliance with strategic partners in the digital communication sector, such as GITGE, facilitated this process and made it possible to launch U-Report in December 2022, during the TEG-Campus, a major annual technological innovation event for youth.
 
The CO mobilized resources to recruit an experienced international consultant to lead the U-Report initiative onsite. This consultancy helped to streamline the process and strengthen the confidence of the Government towards the initiative. The existence of U-Report in neighboring Central African countries was a great motivation for the Government to adopt it. 
 
The CO plans to prioritize adolescent integrated development and engagement in the new cooperation cycle and U-Report will be a critical tool to achieve results.
 
Strategic use of limited evidence 
 
Besides its continued advocacy and support to address data gaps, UNICEF generated pieces of evidence on different subjects (learning outcomes, immunization, birth registration, distance learning, WASH in schools, and the Situation Analysis on children and adolescents). The validation process by the Government of the evidence generated for its use in advocacy and decision-making is complex and time-consuming. For instance, the results of the WASH in schools' study and of the first learning assessments study conducted in 2021 have not yet been validated. The excessive delay in validating represents an opportunity cost the country cannot afford. The preliminary results of the learning assessments conducted at national level in 2022 are consistent with the ones from the previous year and reaffirm the necessity to conduct a profound analysis of the learning gaps and their drivers. A deep dive into the results will allow more robust evidence-based advocacy to promote government ownership and progressive investment to institutionalize the learning assessment for the following years. 
 
UNICEF is adapting its strategy with the MoE by involving technical and decision-making teams right from the start in new evidence-generation initiatives, such as the Teachers for All study. Besides, the MoE signed a formal agreement with clear deliverables and a solid commitment to use the evidence. 
 
Although it is still early to assess the effectiveness of this approach, the CO has learned the importance of initial buy-in from the Government, its active involvement across all the stages of the evidence-generation process, and a formal commitment to disseminate and use it strategically. This approach should be applied with greater emphasis when it comes to national surveys, like the upcoming DHS. Lastly, this experience will guide UNICEF’s strategic decisions on evaluation to be conducted for the following cooperation cycle, with support from the multi-country evaluation specialist. 
 
Looking Ahead
 
The CO is currently developing the new Country Programme 2024-2028. It organized internal and external workshops on RRBM in which preliminary deprivation and bottleneck analysis and theories of change were developed. With the RO’s support and participation of UN agencies, the CO held a SMR. Key takeaways are the need to implement cross-sectoral approaches and deliberated strategies to reduce historical inequalities (mainly gender, geographically and urban/rural based), support the Government to advance in social development, and adopt cross-cutting accelerators of results by working in social protection systems, public finance for children, and social and behavioral change strategies. 
 
The CO is currently producing a new Situation Analysis, which will allow a deeper equity analysis to inform decision-making on geographical focus and UNICEF’s field presence for the following cooperation cycle, considering possible synergies and convergence with other UN agencies, as well as Government’s priorities.  The CO plans to evaluate the experience of the Child-Friendly Districts Initiative in Akurenam, the only district that implemented it. The ongoing Gender Programmatic Review will also provide valuable analysis and guidance for the CO to reinforce and better address severe and persistent gender inequalities.

WCAR,Gabon,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Utilisation sélective des interventions à petite échelle dans des zones défavorisées pour augmenter la capacité de plaidoyer et de changements structurels dans une perspective nationale
           
Dans un pays à revenu intermédiaire de la tranche supérieure où de grandes inégalités sont exacerbées par des crises économique et sanitaire, il s’est avéré capital d’appuyer de manière concrète une stratégie visant à cibler les poches de disparités et influencer le dialogue public par une démonstration de l’efficacité des innovations concrètes pour accompagner le passage à l’échelle. 
           
Dans le cadre du précédent programme, l’approche qui a consisté à utiliser de façon sélective des interventions à petite échelle dans des zones les plus défavorables pour augmenter la capacité de plaidoyer du Bureau et engager les décideurs pour investir plus ou entreprendre des réformes structurelles a démontré un réel succès. 
 
Ainsi, dans le cadre du programme conjoint « Citoyenneté et Protection Sociale » visant le renforcement de l’inclusion et de l’équité du système de protection sociale, l’utilisation des approches multisectorielles a permis de construire une synergie entre différents Départements ministériels. En permettant à plus de 11 700 personnes (soit 0.5% de la population du Gabon) de bénéficier d’un acte de naissance et une éligibilité à l’assurance maladie et autres garanties sociale, UNICEF Gabon a contribué à des réformes légales sur l’enregistrement des naissances, la mise en place du guichet unique pour des opérations de rattrapages pour des personnes sans identité légale, le renforcement de l’état civil et le système d’information de la protection sociale. 
           
Pour y parvenir, l’UNICEF a collaboré avec d’autres agences du SNU (OMS, UNESCO, UNFPA, BIT, ONUSIDA) et a mobilisé son partenariat avec le Sous-Comité des Droits de l’Enfant à l’Assemblée Nationale. Cela a également été favorisé par des initiatives de dialogue politique,  d’influence stratégique et des interventions qui visaient à accroître la capacité des systèmes nationaux à fournir de meilleurs services de qualité à grande échelle, en particulier pour les enfants défavorisés. 
 
Renforcement de la résilience et l’équité des systèmes, programmation tenant compte des risques et adaptation aux changements climatiques
 
Le déclenchement de crises économique et sanitaire a créé des dysfonctionnements importants dans la demande (particulièrement la vaccination de routine) et l’offre de services de santé maternelle et infantile. Ces crises ont surtout démontré l’importance de renforcer la résilience des systèmes de santé. Cela comprend le soutien à la gouvernance en matière de santé (comme la création du Comité de Coordination sectoriel), aux chaînes d’approvisionnement, aux infrastructures, aux personnels, aux systèmes d’informations et aux mécanismes de financement stable et équitable des services de santé pendant et après les crises. Ces financements doivent être protégés, faute de quoi les frais officieux à la charge des utilisateurs se généralisent et compromettent l’équité d’accès.
           
En effet, la chute des prix du pétrole (60% des recettes budgétaires de l’état) sur la période 2014-2020 a contribué à faire stagner la part des dépenses publiques consacrées à la santé qui se situent à 11% contre 15% préconisé. La part des dépenses de santé supportées par les ménages, estimée à plus de 25% n’a cessé de progresser malgré l’existence d’un système d’assurance maladie. Pour contribuer à la résilience du système de santé, l’UNICEF a élevé son plaidoyer en faveur des mécanismes stables de financement de la santé, à travers l’appui à la génération des évidences (étude sur l’espace fiscal de la santé). 
 
L’appui de l’UNICEF s’est également étendu au renforcement de la chaîne d’approvisionnement. Ainsi, UNICEF Gabon, en collaboration avec l’OMS, UNFPA, ONUSIDA, a aidé à l’élaboration d’une stratégie nationale des approvisionnements et de gestion des produits de santé. Grâce à un appui du Gouvernement japonais, UNICEF Gabon a contribué à renforcer la chaîne de froid de la vaccination en mettant un accent sur les équipements, la formation du personnel, les systèmes d’information tout en tenant compte et en corrigeant les disparités entre les différentes zones sanitaires. Une des stratégies utilisées par le Bureau a consisté en la promotion des technologies vertes (solutions énergétiques durables, gestion des déchets, réduction de la pollution) respectueuses de l’environnement et adaptées aux changements climatiques. 
 
Renforcement des partenariats, du plaidoyer et des approches décentralisées comme stratégie majeure
 
Le statut du Gabon comme un pays à revenu intermédiaire de la tranche supérieure (UMIC), la fragilité du contexte macroéconomique mondial et la réduction de l’aide publique au développement vers l’Afrique sub-saharienne exposent les difficultés du Bureau pour augmenter les ressources supplémentaires et atteindre de meilleurs résultats. Pour ce faire, le Bureau a mis une emphase sur le développement des partenariats, le plaidoyer et la coopération décentralisée.  
           
Conformément aux Principes des Droits de l'Enfant et des Entreprises (CRBP), UNICEF Gabon a accru sa collaboration avec le secteur privé. Ce partenariat en cours de développement a déjà permis d’engager la Fédération des Entreprises du Gabon (FEG) qui produisent près de 80% du PIB et emploient plus de 90% de la main-d'œuvre formelle. La collaboration s’étendra également au renforcement des capacités, au développement des plateformes communes pour porter le plaidoyer en faveur des droits de l’enfant, tirer profit de l’expertise des entreprises, influencer des politiques (family friendly workplace policies), des pratiques (au sein et en dehors des entreprises) et des produits pour les enfants. 
 
Pour y arriver, le Bureau a créé un position d’Administrateur de programme chargé de partenariat, pour animer et intégrer cette stratégie transversale dans les programmes sectoriels. En outre, la création et le développement de contenus engageants, persuasifs et continus sur les plateformes digitales, ayant touché plus de 900 000 personnes sur ses divers réseaux sociaux a renforcé la crédibilité de la marque UNICEF et d’élargir la base des amis de l’UNICEF. "
WCAR,Gambia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Important lessons have been documented across all of GCO’s programmatic domains as a result of an intense year. These will be useful for the continued improvement of interventions for children, and for the development of the next Country Programme. 
 
In the child survival and development domain, remarkable efforts have been made on institutional systems strengthening with a bottom-up community engagement approach, involving the active participation of youth, adolescents, religious leaders and the social media in the multiple vaccination campaigns. However, the AKI outbreak and Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy negatively impacted the trust of the population in the public health system resulting in less-than-optimal outcomes. A key lesson is the need to intensify continuous social mobilization through empowerment and retention of these stakeholders to generate greater confidence in the system.  Multi-agency platforms such as the Intra-Action Reviews are valuable opportunities to position this lesson.  
 
The Mother MUAC, a low-cost, equity-focused and effective innovation to treat malnourished children, is paying dividends, and is ripe for rapid escalation, as it successfully reached an increasing number of vulnerable families in many communities.  It represents an alternative to high-cost nutrition surveillance, which has been difficult to finance. In line with the Regional Office recommendation, GCO will do a scale-up analysis to develop a theory of change and identify public and private financing streams and partnerships, as well as potential bottlenecks for removal. The integration of nutrition activities, such as vitamin A supplementation and deworming, with immunization campaigns represents an example of multi-sectoral programming that can be taken to scale and replicated in other sectors. 
 
The key lesson learnt related to water and sanitation is the need for an equity-based balance between rural areas, concentrating the majority of vulnerable communities, and urban areas, which tend to be neglected, and yet have equally pressing needs as demonstrated during the recent floods that disproportionately affected the urban poor.  GCO will not be able, nor is mandated, to respond to these enormous needs, therefore it will be critical to continue leading coordination mechanisms and engage with larger multilateral partners to ensure that infrastructure development and rehabilitation are equity-driven.  UNICEF can play a role in developing innovative, low-cost and replicable small-scale water and sanitation infrastructure and advocate for national authorities to ensure that they are rolled out to vulnerable households and communities. Similarly, amplifying the country’s commitment to end open defecation requires a bottom-up approach, thus working with youth organizations and local leaders will be instrumental to scale up efforts.  
 
Notwithstanding the important gains advancing the policy and legislative framework to support an effective national child protection system, there is ample room to improve service delivery for the most vulnerable children.  This will require, inter alia, accelerating the number and types of interventions, including more integrated services such as one-stop centres and Safe to Learn Schools, where vulnerable children and women can access health, psycho-social counseling and legal support.  This must be accompanied by stronger government commitments to ensure that national and local enforcement and compliance mechanisms are in place to address and prevent child rights violations, also requiring more investment in the social service workforce.  The newly available training modules for the case management of vulnerable children is an important step forward.  GCO must also accelerate its support to an effective national child protection steering committee.  The first-ever situation analysis of the child protection sector confirms the urgency of sustained investment in data collection, analysis and dissemination for improved planning and implementation.  
 
Against the pandemic backdrop, GCO will continue strengthening the resiliency of the education system to be more shock responsive.  The Transforming Education Summit confirmed foundational learning and sector financing as core priorities, whilst the World Conference on Early Childhood Care and Education exposed the government to best practices and innovations to continually improve this sub-sector.  A lesson derived was the need for more homegrown research on the first 1,000 days of a child’s life to better inform programming for young children.  The revamped focus on out-of-school children is an excellent opportunity to strengthen the equity and inclusion agenda, and to expand it to other vulnerable children. 
 
The important strides made in social protection, social policy and public financing for children (PF4C) have generated important lessons.  As part of the development of the new country programme, the theory of change behind our policy work will be reviewed to identify the resources and enabling environment required to transform policy commitments into results for children.  The evolving PF4C agenda will sustain the capacity building of National Assembly Members and ministerial budget officers on public financing processes, accompanied by more GCO leadership in developing policy and budget briefs and expenditure reviews in key child-focused sectors.  GCO will advocate for the establishment of a social sector budget allocation committee to promote Program Based Budgeting and support the National Assembly to conduct mid- and end-line budget reviews and tracking.   GCO will continue supporting the National Social Protection Secretariat to improve coordination efficiency and monitoring instruments, as well as stronger legislative backing of the national social protection policy. 
 
GCO’s continued strengthening of coordination mechanisms and collaborative partnerships has yielded successes and resources for children.  National institutions have been strengthened, but there is still room for improved governmental leadership. GCO has adopted a participatory approach with active engagement of government, UN agencies, development partners, CSOs, private sector, and academia, as well as children and adolescents, in the CPD development process, ensuring capacity development of partners in results- and rights-based programming. Relatedly, strengthening data management systems (including surveys and administrative) and the culture of monitoring and evaluation across all sectors is urgently needed to ensure the availability of accurate and timely data to monitor progress. 
 
Taking early actions on staff welfare concerns is fundamental to ensuring a conducive and respectful work environment.  The organization of deep dives on psychological safety and internal communications have empowered staff to be more engaged and proactive. Despite positive Global Staff Survey results, lingering concerns on performance management, workload distribution, and work-life balance must be addressed using the same approach. 
"
WCAR,Ghana,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Several lessons were learned, and innovations introduced by UNICEF directly or through its support to government in 2022. 

UNICEF explored new channels such as community-based volunteers for community surveillance and leveraged universities for SBC capacity building. It continued to Reimagine Education through digital learning solutions, strengthened information management systems, and drove denominator-based planning approaches in its programme design and implementation. 

2 assessments conducted in 2022 have implications for UNICEF programming inter-sectorally and cross-sectorally.

1. Key Findings from the VNR: Ghana launched the 2022 VNR report on the implementation of the SDGs. The report, the second since 2019, was prepared through a collaborative process which involved the UN (including UNICEF), development partners, CSOs, private sector and the youth (engaged by UNICEF through U-Report). Its findings demonstrated the need to redouble efforts to bring about critical socio-economic transformations and fulfill the promise of the SDGs. Key learnings and next steps relevant for UNICEF programming included:

The assessment of the progress on implementation of the SDGs showed a high level of access to water and electricity (almost at universal levels), gender parity at the KG, primary and JHS levels and high completion rate despite the COVID-19 pandemic. 
However, unemployment and inequality have been exacerbated by COVID-19. Open defecation, waste collection and management are improving but at a slow pace. Other challenges include a huge funding gap, low adoption of science, technology and innovation, and timely access to reliable and disaggregated data.
Achieving the SDGs largely depends on sustainable and innovative financing mechanisms. While GoG demonstrated its commitment to ensuring SDGs are aligned with the national budget, financing gaps persist within the current macroeconomic context. This requires a deliberate effort to connect private sector, development partners, social entrepreneurship, innovation, and research to critical SDGs action. Though some gains have been made in private sector contributions, there remains enormous and untapped investment opportunities for SDGs.
Investment in youth must be strengthened to address rising unemployment. GoG’s YouStart initiative provides opportunities to support youth entrepreneurs with start-up capital. The African Continental Free Trade Agreement is an opportunity to boost the productive sector of the economy and address unemployment. Addressing vulnerabilities including persons with disabilities requires the widening of social protection coverage and intensification of infrastructure provision in key sectors such as health, education and sanitation services.
Effective research, monitoring and evaluation systems are required to evaluate the impact of programmes and identify critical success factors, bottlenecks and population groups which are being left behind. Collaboration between local and international research institutions and implementers at all levels must be advanced. Collaborative efforts to build the capacity of MMDAs and MDAs and establish strong connections between CSOs and research institutions will encourage tracking progress.

2. Key Learnings from the Country Assessment of Youth: Ghana’s rapidly growing population of 31 million with 56% of the population under the age of 25 has led to the emergence of a youth bulge. This has the potential to create a demographic dividend. UNICEF, in support of GenU, commissioned a country assessment of the youth ecosystem in Ghana focused on secondary education, technical and vocational training (TVET), employment, entrepreneurship, and engagement.

In secondary education, poor educational outcomes (access and quality), lack of relevant career counseling services, barriers to tech-assisted education and online learning, and misalignment between curriculum and pedagogy for learning transferable and ICT skills persist. Progress against these constraints will need public-private partnerships for accelerating connectivity and digital skills training, a focus on pedagogy for ICT skilling, and in-school and out-of-school counselling services in collaboration with the private sector.
In TVET, inconsistency in curricula and certification for apprenticeships, no well-functioning skills anticipation system, inadequate infrastructure and training, and an overall low demand for TVET due to socio-cultural biases emerged as constraints to build an industry-ready workforce. Targeted skills development programmes for vulnerable groups, private sector engagement for better alignment on skilling needs in the country, and increased advocacy and awareness of the value of TVET will help alleviate these constraints.
Challenges in employment include demand-side factors, supply-side factors, and a mismatch between demand and supply. Unemployment rate among youth (15-35 years) is 19.7%. Underemployment persists with 45.5% of youth working less than 30 hours per week across the formal and informal sectors. Gender and regional inequities are exacerbated by lack of pre-employment support. A review and restructuring of government pre-employment services could improve employability of youth, supported by an improvement in the provisioning and quality of internships, apprenticeships, and induction trainings. Youth-focused investment in growth sectors of the economy will help realize accelerated gains from youth employment.
Youth entrepreneurs have limited access to capital, operate in a challenging business and legal environment, and are concentrated in the informal sector. Despite this, 80% of entrepreneurs consider entrepreneurship to be a good career choice. Scaling up of support services such as business counselling, mentoring, and business development support, especially for female entrepreneurs, is critical. The entrepreneurship curricula should include social entrepreneurship, have an experiential component, and emphasize entrepreneurship skill building. GoG programmes such as YouStart have the potential to accelerate youth entrepreneurship, if designed and implemented well.
Lastly, civic engagement among youth is low, and there are gender and regional inequities in access to civic engagement and participation opportunities. This is driven by a lack of leadership training in school, negative socio-cultural norms and attitudes around youth engaging in public discourse and low digital engagement due to lack of access to ICT tools. To overcome this, adults and community leaders’ capacity to include youth in social dialogue can be improved. Youth capacity to engage constructively in advocacy efforts can be strengthened and decentralized youth spaces to engage with policy makers should be created"
WCAR,Guinea,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Innovations
 
Interoperability between programme components proved beneficial in several ways. In addition to achieving the goals regarding Vitamin A supplementation, deworming, and birth registration, and child marriage, the joint campaigns implemented by the child protection and health programmes had other benefits: (i) Strengthening coordination between the child protection and health sectors; (ii) Improving the scale, scope and reach, of multi-sector interventions that cater for a greater number of vulnerable children across the country; (iii) Improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the program by sharing operating costs (media, logistics, communication and supervision) during joint interventions; and (iv) Strengthening the capacities of wider communities and families on the universal and multidimensional nature of children's rights.
 
The use of SMS reminders to mothers, in local languages, via the existing DHIS 2 digital platform is an innovation than can significantly contribute to the reduction of immunization dropout rate, while improving vaccination coverage as in the municipality of Matoto in Conakry city up to 51% for the 1st dose of pentavalent vaccine. The use of georeferenced data to conduct the head count of children in Conakry helped improve the denominator of immunization measurements and is a good methodology to integrate in urban vaccination strategies for a better control of vaccination target population.
 
The networking of community radios allowed further mobilization of the media on the promotion of children's rights, to strengthen their capacities in a coherent manner. It also helped create a synergy between community radios and other State technical services so that they can pool their efforts and work together to promote essential family practices. 
 
The Teaching at The Right Level (TaRL[1]) approach to education was implemented for the first time in Guinea. It is a three-step approach of accelerated learning at the classroom level, comprising: i) assessment of children, using simple tools, in reading and mathematics; ii) grouping of children by learning level rather than by age or class; iii) development of fundamental skills through an interactive teaching and learning methodology and play-based activities, adapted to each student's level.
 
Lessons learned
 
Lessons learned during programme implementation, and those formulated in the above-mentioned evaluation reports, will feed into future UNICEF actions, starting with the finalization of the next CPD.
 
The ‘ODF Prefecture’ approach based on the leadership of municipalities (the triggering and follow up of municipal council with the support of local NGOs and prefects) has added value to the sanitation strategy: acceleration of the certification of triggered communities, reaching out many people (the aim is to reach all communities in the prefecture), support the post ODF strategy to reduce slippage while creating a conducive environment for more improved sanitation facilities (sanitation marketing).
 
As demonstrated by an independent evaluation conducted in 2022, the convergence municipalities approach proved successful, bringing essential services to local communities and positively impacting the wellbeing of children and their families. The results recorded in the municipalities not covered by the ICC were not as good, underlining the efficacy of the approach in the 40 pilot municipalities. In order for the approach to be successfully scaled up, the commitment of government partners is indispensable.
 
 
Emerging Opportunities and Adjustments for 2023 
 
In order to strengthen social inclusion, domestic financing of child rights interventions the national budget is key to achieving the SDGs for children. Thus, the African Partnership for Children (APC) proves to be an innovative approach to sustainably improve the domestic financing of child rights programs.
 
The noticeable engagement of the transitional government to improve health sector governance and accountability, which resulted in changes across programs and projects, represents an important opportunity for the improvement in health-related indicators. Guinea’s adherence to the vaccine independence initiative with the Prime Minister as a vaccination champion, and the ambition to increase the vaccination coverage rate of the Pentavalent 3 vaccine by 20 percentage points by the end of 2023, will help to relaunch the immunization program sustainably. The launch of the APC by the Prime Minister will help mobilize substantial domestic resources needed to fund the priorities related to immunization, nutrition and community health. The signing of the Conakry Declaration and Roadmap by the Prime Minister will enable mobilization of resources for better preparedness to epidemics.
 
The adoption of the law on local public services and the signing of the implementing texts of the Code of local communities offer new prospects for consolidating the decentralization process in Guinea, by enabling municipalities to recruit the human resources necessary to implement the competencies that have been transferred to them.
 
The rollout of the new GPE financial model and UNICEF's current role as technical and financial lead partner provide opportunities to boost the education sector and advance the realization of children’s right to education. In addition, the update of the national preschool policy integrating a year of preschool is seen as a positive opportunity.
 
To ensure a risk-informed programmatic approach and to mitigate the impact of hazards on children and the basic social services on which they depend, UNICEF, in collaboration with the Government, conducted a Child Risk and Impact Analysis (CRIA)[2]. The results showed that children are disproportionately affected by these ""high-risk"" changes in all aspects of their lives, with multiplier effects depending on their individual and specific vulnerabilities, socio-economic status, age category, gender, and geographic location. Along with other evidence-based data, the results are informing ongoing reflections for the elaboration of the new country program (2024-2028).

"
WCAR,Guinea Bissau,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"While working on strengthening the leadership and coordination capacities of the Ministry of Health, partnerships with national and international NGOs have proven critical. The resumption of partnerships agreements with international NGO partners improved the implementation of community health activities. These NGOs undertake third user monitoring for UNICEF to ensure the appropriate use of funds transferred to the MoH. They also contribute to capacity building at regional level on resource management. 
 
Risk management strategies are systematically applied to ensure continuity in service provision and to improve national accountability. In 2022, an important risk management strategy was the use of mobile money payments sent directly to health workers. This strategy significantly reduced administrative bottlenecks and inefficiencies; for example, a COVID-19 vaccination campaign using Mobile Money transfers facilitated the payment of approximately $US927,582 in stipends to vaccinators. This action addressed the difficulties of liquidating expenditures by implementing partners and delays in funds transfer to targeted recipients.
 
The effort to fully integrating COVID-19 into routine immunization needs to continue. The COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the polio and measles outbreaks became opportunities for strengthening health care delivery, particularly on immunisation. As complicated as integration of several activities were, it was still worth the effort of integrating Vitamin A supplementation and deworming into the first polio campaign. Direct staff participation in the polio campaign, provided a renewed sense of purpose, particularly for those whose functions often keep them in the office.
 
This year, WASH programming leveraged immunization activities, particularly cold chain strengthening, to enable mobilization for the adoption of safe sanitation and hygiene practices with the view to eliminating open defecation. Similarly, the Immunization program will also benefit from the WASH expertise in data collection and the use of real-time monitoring tools, notably with mWater to improve vaccine stock management. This innovation allows for community mobilization to achieve ODF status and is concurrently promoting vaccination in hard-to-reach communities and facilitating knowledge transfer to vaccination managers both at the local and central levels.
 
An important constraint identified by MEN and key education partners is the lack of a comprehensive, clear, and transparent planning and budgeting process for the education sector. National directorates do not have the funds necessary to buy materials and/or implement activities that are crucial for the effective functioning of the system. For example, teacher and student attendance logs are not included in annual budgets, nor are data collections forms. As a result, MEN requires donors to purchase these items on an ad hoc basis, which has a negative effect on both access and quality. In 2023 UNICEF must work with counterparts from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy and Planning to improve budgeting and planning at MEN to ensure key operational needs are fully funded. 
 
South-south, regional, and continental cooperation to achieve SDG 16.9 (legal identity for all) is a trigger for change. The participation of the Guinea-Bissau delegation in the 6th Ministerial conference of the African Union for Civil Registration and Vital Statistics raised awareness and strengthened the capacities of the multi-sectoral team (Minister of Justice and Human Rights, Ministry of Health and Ministry of Planning/statistical department). The learning experience and exchange of challenges and best practices in the interoperability with the health sector and the digitalization of the CRVS system motivated the Guinea-Bissau team. In 2022, the Government became more aware of the best practices in similar contexts as and has demonstrated interest to accelerate full interoperability between civil registration and health sectors, including testing and scaling-up digital solutions. The Ministry of Justice is discussing strategies with the Ministry of Health for stronger collaboration and high-level decisions to implement innovative approaches in this area. 
 
UNICEF is providing technical support to expand the use of mWater to monitor WASH interventions in communities, schools and health centers, the use of RapidPro to collect data on birth registration in registration centers installed in health facilities, as well as the use of Kobocollect to collect data and monitor the results of interventions in health centers at national level. Technical support enabled capacity building of users, determination and definition of indicators to be selected, analysis of data collected, and reporting.
 
In a context where routine management information systems remain weak, strategies to strengthen public sector data collection, quality assurance and use through periodic reviews at the subnational level, as is the case with the community health programme must be updated and institutionalized for different UNICEF supported programme components. The deployment of UNICEF consultants improved collection of gender and age disaggregated data in all regions for immunization and community health services. The approach can be expanded with partner support. 
 
Partnerships with traditional power structures, in the context of RCCE during health emergency campaigns significantly contributed to reducing fear, stigma, and misinformation, improving turnout and uptake.  During the Polio campaign, most partner radios were shut down by the Ministry of Social Communication for regularization of their status, and SBC unit resorted to traditional power structures as an alternative platform and communication channel to disseminate information nationwide, which proved to be an effective mechanism for community mobilization, with positive results.  
 
The collaboration with Young UNICEF for the organization of the Youth Mobilization Meeting has allowed space for innovative thinking. It brought the teams to reflect on social mobilization strategies and allowed UNICEF Guinea-Bissau to acquire a new strategic partner in young people. The office will leverage the power of youth in mobilizing communities to accelerate Key Results for Children in Guinea Bissau. The country office needs to mobilize resources for the expansion of digital engagement tools and the introduction of platforms such as U-Report, including dedicated human resources. The office still needs to develop/acquire appropriate tools to collect data on the direct effect of SBC interventions on behavior change and programme results.  

"
WCAR,Liberia,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Field presence in hard-to-reach counties characterized by the low level of human development parameters has proved to be instrumental in accelerating the achievement of key results for children. UNICEF Liberia created an outpost in Zwedru (Grand Gedeh County) that enhanced the visibility and reach of UNICEF's work in four southeastern counties. This field presence has further strengthened the multi-sectoral approach that has been catalytic to the achievements of Key Results for Children. The outpost established a close collaboration and coordination mechanism with the County Superintendent and county team. The reactivation of the coordination actors working in Grand Gedeh County facilitated improved monitoring and tracking of programme implementation, contributing to accelerating the key results for children, notably immunization, birth registration and monitoring of children's rights.
 
Building on the potential and initial learning from the field presence at Zwedru, UNICEF signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA) to work with County Government. This is to improve multi-sectoral coordination among all actors, improve tracking and monitoring of the programme implementation, and build local capacities of county superintendent's office to plan, budget, implement, and report. 
 
The alternative payment modalities continued to improve in managing cash transfers and mitigating multiple risks. These alternative payment modalities (Direct payment and Mobile Money payment) were implemented in response to the Harmonized Approach to Cash Transfer. The continued trust in alternative payment modalities has been effective and contributed to building internal and external capacities for risk management. 
 
Proactive engagements with various line ministries and parliamentarians to increase domestic resource allocations to key priorities for Liberian children have gained momentum. UNICEF has initiated dialogue and advocacy with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund on issues of fiscal space and the impact of debt on the needs of children and the most vulnerable segments of society. This has made initial gains on various platforms. For example, following the Transformation Education Summit, the Government took the opportunity to organize a National Conference on Education supported by UNICEF. This conference was held under the leadership of the Vice President of the country, bringing together key national stakeholders, including traditional leaders, legislative representatives, the MoFDP, and education sector partners such as UNESCO, GPE and the World Bank. This national conference ended with a demonstrated political will to increase the budget allocation for the education sector gradually and to undertake the systemic and strategic reforms to launch the initiative ""1 billion USD in five years for the education sector"".
 
UNICEF collaborated strongly with Government entities to generate evidence to support policymaking and improve programme implementation. The implementation of recommendations of the formative evaluation of Key Results for Children #7 – Birth Registration conducted in 2021 has been instrumental in bringing transformational changes in the Birth Registration system and its financing. The formative evaluation was conducted jointly with MoH with strong technical support from the UNICEF Regional Office. A pilot of integrating Birth Registration Information Management System into DHIS 2 successfully concluded, and the integration has been initiated throughout the country. Similarly, the cost of human resources engaged in birth registration has been included in the annual health budget. However, allocations were not made as per the planned budget. UNICEF continues to advocate for allocations in the next financial year.
 
Building on evidence generation in the past two years through supporting the conduct of a Demographic and Health Survey, ongoing Population Census, Child Poverty Analysis, multiple programme evaluations, and RFSNLMS in 2022, UNICEF partnered with the Liberia Institute of Statistics and Geo-Information Services and MoFDP to undertake a Data Landscape Diagnostic and development of Data Strategy for UNICEF. The data landscape diagnostic informed the development of the data strategy with extensive technical support from UNICEF regional office and headquarters. Data Strategy will inform and guide UNICEF’s investments for 2023- 2025. However, in this process, it was realized that investment in further strengthening the routine data systems deserves priority and continued support. More technical assistance and investments in the integration of data systems and timely availability of disaggregated data are critical to reaching the most marginalized children and women and addressing the challenges of inequality and inequity. 
 
To ensure sustained community engagement, UNICEF deployed 15 United Nations Volunteers. These UNVs proved critical in enhancing community engagement in programme implementation and programme coordination at the community level.  The UNVs were recruited, assigned to all 15 counties, and embedded in the County Health Team, increasing UNICEF’s presence at the sub-national level. UNVs engaged communities, religious and traditional leaders, and local authorities. This engagement has strengthened the community feedback mechanism; it allows the communities’ concerns and grievances to be addressed. The role of traditional leaders as part of community engagement has proven effective in advancing the prevention of harmful social norms and behavioral practices which put women and girls at a disadvantage. Targeting specifically the influencers such as Zoes, traditional and religious leaders, parents themselves, and teachers continued to stimulate interest in wanting to change social and gender norms which discriminate against women and girls.

WCAR,Mali,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"
Constraints 

The safety of all staff continued as major concerns especially in the north and centre of the country, with numerous reports of assault, intimidation, arbitrary detention and other forms of mistreatment.  Agencies were also vulnerable to the theft and looting of relief supplies.  These concerns constrained programme implementation across all sectors.
  
Restrictions on field visits led to a lack of reliable data and inaccurate estimates of measles and COVID-19 cases.  UNICEF and others are trying to use alternative data collection instruments including such as Level 3 and third-party monitoring.  During the last quarter of 2022, UNICEF developed a data strategy framework, “One Stop Data Management Point”. 

Opportunities

UNICEF can provide more budgetary and other support than at present to scaled-up, long-term and risk-informed local systems so that they can play an appropriately important role in pre-empting and responding to shocks and stressors and mitigating the impact of conflict, displacement, hunger, poverty and climate change. 

UNICEF can build on relations with local institutions and community leaders to develop holistic and integrated approaches and reposition Social Behaviour Change as a cross-cutting strategy rather than standalone programme.

The ‘agile’ approach, using mobile teams of social workers, psychologists and others to visit families and communities and provide psychosocial support to the most vulnerable children through individual and small-group activities could contribute to ending violence against children and gender-based violence.

Lessons learned

Outputs and activities that systematically incorporate the views and voices of children speaking out against violations of child rights contribute to improved results and contribute to the sustainability of outputs and outcomes.
  
Children and young people are often more at ease than their elders with the role of digital technology in their lives.  

Communities, families and children of either sex can often have greater trust in Community Health Workers and other local actors than in civil servants or other government workers.

The socio-political crisis, ECOWAS sanctions and the COVID-19 emergency showed not only how effectively national systems can meet humanitarian needs but also why it is important to link humanitarian and development interventions

A multi-country FGM evaluation showed that community engagement in the reduction of child marriage and FGM contributed significantly to programme success.  In response, the child protection and gender sections are developing targeted interventions based on the real costs of community engagement. 

In 2022, UNICEF supported research on the empowerment of women and girls for the programme to support resilience, food security and nutrition. Recommendations were made for advancing equality between women and men, and girls and boys. 

UNICEF consolidated its technology for development (T4D) portfolio and developed technology platforms to monitor results in emergencies, with protocols for data collection and analysis such as WASH-FIT, computer-assisted personal interviews (CAPIs), the educational management information system (EMIS) and open data kit (ODK) platforms for real-time monitoring of interventions.

A PSEA specialist in the country office is helping counterparts from government and NGO structures to conform with UNICEF PSEA standards and procedures. 

Information from field trips and interviews with beneficiaries can be used to strengthen resource mobilisation and relations with donors. The use of this type of personal evidence at the various public and private events organised by UNICEF has built confidence in UNICEF's capacity and led to the mobilization of additional resources. 

Taking lessons learned forward  

UNICEF will continue to help young people and children express their views, voice their concerns and explore and implement solutions to the problems they face. 
 
Emergency stocks will be pre-positioned in all regions as an essential requirement for reaching those in urgent need in a timely manner.

To strengthen Malian leadership and ownership of the country programme, the life-cycle approach will be used to develop local integrated monitoring and evaluation systems.  This could also lead to a more holistic, coherent, and coordinated UNSDCF than at present.

Digital awareness and skills development for staff and their counterparts will be a priority to facilitate the use of new technologies in the Country Programme.

"
WCAR,Mauritania,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Programmes ensured the geographic convergence of interventions promoted by the 2018-2022 UNDAF, and several opportunities have been seized to strengthen complementarity and intersectoral synergies.

The implementation of preventive interventions using Community awareness and learning woman Groups (GASPA) is a gateway to rationalize resources for the implementation of integrated multisectoral interventions around the ‘First 1000 days’ approach on which UNICEF is positioning itself for the next programme cycle 2024-2027. Indeed, these first 1000 days constitute a unique and critical window of opportunity for the physical, psycho-motor, intellectual and cognitive development of the child. The office refined its vision of the participatory community approach as a model for integrated interventions to achieve the decentralisation policy. The approach aims to empower people in a process of dialogue, learning, decision-making, and action where all members of a community, including the vulnerable and the marginalized, become aware of their strengths, assess themselves, and work collectively to identify and analyse the challenges they face, and develop practical solutions to their problems.

Thanks to the strengthening of intersectoral interventions with health-nutrition, education and social protection sectors, child protection services have been delocalized and universal prevention of violence strengthened as advocated in the child protection 2021-2030 strategic plan. Indeed, by integrating child protection in 263 GASPAs, 3,945 women have been sensitized to violence against children, creating a protective environment for over 4,000 children. Similarly, families receiving cash has allowed the identification of 1,301 children and their referment to the protection services. In school, teachers have been trained and codes of conduct put in place, as well as mechanisms for reporting violence. All the relays and teachers trained will enable the identification and care of children living in localities where protection services are non-existent. The multisectoral approach built the community resilience and reinforced social cohesion.

Two external evaluations of the IYCF plan were carried out in 2022 on the 5 years of implementation, and the link between the cash social protection programme and the improvement of optimal IYCF practices. These evaluations showed an improvement in knowledge and in the practice of exclusive breastfeeding, but there is a need for community and household close supervision and the sustainability of IYCF interventions. Thus, it was recommended to integrate the scaling up of IYCF practices in the Regional strategy for accelerated growth and shared prosperity and in communal development plans, and to promote the coherence and integration of the IYCF dimension in the sectoral vision of the MASEF.

The involvement of UNICEF in the education sector diagnosis process, leading to the elaboration of the National Education System Status Report (RESEN), offered the opportunity to place the issue of out-of-school children and preschool as a sub-sector in national priorities, and to address risks and vulnerabilities to reinforce the resilience of the system. Although UNICEF is not the lead of the technical and financial partners for education, it maintained its position as champion of the right to education. It is therefore essential to maintain this position to continue supporting the levers for strengthening human capital.

The initiative on disaster prevention and preparedness is a relevant experience to promote risk-based planning and prevention of climate change impacts on the education sector and protection of learners. This has enabled the mobilization of a standby partner with NORCAP, the continuation of the policy dialogue on climate change, and the positioning of UNICEF as an essential partner in education and consequently in the mobilization of related funds.  

Using the Social Register platform to transfer cash to beneficiaries has reduced the risk of duplicate payments and claims. Thanks to the geolocation system, payments are tracked in real time by all stakeholders. Reconciliation of figures between the social register, programme implementation teams and the bank are also done automatically. Coordination with other programmes using the register is also automatically synchronized.

The SAFIA approach, based on an integrated community participatory process, is a new model of engagement with youth that involves them as actors of change. The services offered in the SAFIA centres correspond to the wishes and grievances of the young girls. The challenge identified remains that of sustainability for which UNICEF is working at establishing synergies, particularly with the private sector.

The country has long been confronted with the weak integration of climate change into sectoral programmes. The recent experience with the Ministry of Water and Sanitation (MHA) is a model for the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development (MEDD). The support to the MHA at integrating climate change in the programmatic framework documents has led to a sustained dialogue between the two ministries. The MHA is now the first ministry to initiate this process in alignment with the Nationally Determined Contributions. The approach is supported by the MEDD and advocates for a better involvement of the sectoral departments and their partners in similar processes.

The WASH intervention model developed in the peri-urban area has ensured convergence and coordination of key actors. This model involving local authorities, private operators, water and sanitation services, and communities, has accelerated the access to water and sanitation services for the populations of these areas. This model has fostered multi-sectoral coordination at the operational level, with a focus on strengthening governance systems in municipalities while ensuring the involvement of young entrepreneurs to provide innovative solutions, particularly in sanitation, hygiene promotion and waste management.

All these lessons learned, and innovation are being taken into account in the development process of the next CPD 2024-2027, and will inform the implementation of the programme in 2023, which is a transitional year that will allow for new, more effective and efficient multisectoral approaches, especially in the communities, to strengthen resilience and participation.

WCAR,Niger,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Face aux crises multidimensionnelles, liées à l’insécurité, aux épidémies, aux crises climatiques, à la pression démographique et aux retards d’approvisionnement, la continuité des services essentiels a posé un défi majeur auquel l’UNICEF a dû s’adapter. Le financement de l’intégration de la vaccination contre la COVID-19 dans la vaccination de routine a été un bon levier pour le renforcement du système de santé, avec pour conséquence directe l’amélioration de l’offre et de la qualité des services de vaccination. Le recours aux AEP multi-villages dans un contexte hydrogéologique difficile a permis de maximiser les coûts en termes d’investissement et a facilité l’accès à l’eau potable à plusieurs villages, et le raccordement des écoles et centres de santé. La confection des tables bancs par les apprenants des centres de formation aux métiers dans les Directions Régionales de l’Enseignement Technique / Formation Professionnelle, a permis d’accélérer l’acquisition de compétences de ces derniers et d’améliorer la qualité des produits fabriqués localement. L’utilisation de la modalité cash pour les dotations en kits BNA a permis à l’UNICEF de pallier les ruptures de stock en kits.  
Afin d’assurer l’accès pour les populations les plus vulnérables, y compris les personnes déplacées, il a été nécessaire d’adopter des approches intégrées. Les restrictions des mouvements ont eu un impact négatif sur le monitoring des activités du programme, d’où le recours accru à RapidPro et le suivi à travers les autorités municipales et les Directions régionales/départementales. Le renforcement des capacités des communautés vivant dans des zones d’insécurité a permis une meilleure implication et appropriation lors de la mise en œuvre des activités préventives de distribution de masse des moustiquaires imprégnées et de la vaccination. 
Face aux traumatismes subis par les enfants affectés par les violences des GANE et les capacités limitées des partenaires à fournir une réponse en santé mentale et un soutien psychosocial adaptés, l’UNICEF a travaillé sur le développement d’une véritable stratégie de santé mentale à travers des projets intégrant trois approches : survie, apprentissage et protection. 
L’UNICEF a également poursuivi ses efforts pour soutenir le développement, de manière participative dans 15 communes pilotes, d’une approche de contrat social qui synthétise les outils et approches utilisés dans la gouvernance participative du développement local au Niger. Basé sur la méthode de recherche action participative développée par la CAPEG, le contrat social inscrit dans l’action publique locale une démarche participative associant tous les acteurs de développement dans la recherche d’un consensus sur les problèmes et solutions à apporter à une thématique prioritaire.  Dans le cadre du processus de décentralisation, l’UNICEF a contribué à renforcer les capacités des collectivités territoriales de base, précisément dans la région de Diffa où des activités pilotes d’opérationnalisation des Plans Communaux de Sauvegarde (PCS) ont été mise en œuvre. Ces activités visent, à terme, à rendre les communes plus aptes et outillées en matière de préparation et réponses aux chocs.  Le manque de données fiables a incité l’UNICEF à poursuivre des initiatives innovantes pour renforcer l’assurance qualité, le suivi des informations et les approches communautaires. Face à la faiblesse dans la remontée des données, la formation des travailleurs sociaux et leurs superviseurs sur les outils de travail avant leur mise en place a eu un impact positif sur la capacité d’utilisation desdits supports et le rapportage.  Les réunions de coordination avec les districts sanitaires ont constitué un cadre de surveillance et d’analyse des données et d’identification des défis et des besoins spécifiques adaptés aux conditions locales et utiles pour surmonter les difficultés rencontrées début 2022 pour le suivi des informations de nutrition L’UNICEF a profité de la mise à jour du système d’information sanitaire (DHIS2) pour améliorer et intégrer des indicateurs nutrition sur la malnutrition aiguë, la vitamine A, l’alimentation du nourrisson et du jeune enfant et la nutrition maternelle. 
En termes d'innovation, l’investissement fait par l’UNICEF dans le renforcement du système d’information sanitaire communautaire à travers la digitalisation (mHealth) contribue à l’amélioration de la qualité de l’offre de soins par l’algorithme de prise en charge, le suivi des données communautaires en temps réel et leur intégration dans le DHIS2. Les applications RapidPro et Kobo Collect développées par l'UNICEF en collaboration avec la Direction de la vaccination ont permis de prendre des décisions en temps réel, notamment en matière de redéploiement des vaccins et de réduire le nombre de doses périmées et de jours de rupture de stock. L’évaluation réalisée dans cinq régions pour mesurer la disponibilité et l’utilisation des intrants nutritionnels jusqu’au niveau des bénéficiaires offrent aux partenaires gouvernementaux et l’UNICEF tous les éléments pour améliorer la chaîne d’approvisionnement. Le renforcement des capacités des prestataires a joué un rôle important dans l'amélioration de la qualité de la prestation de services sur le terrain. 
Le projet pilote « e-Commune » en cours d’expérimentation dans 8 communes des régions de Diffa et Zinder vise à mettre en place un système d’information simple, centralisé pour gérer les données des communes, désagrégées jusqu'au niveau village. Ce projet, dont les bases de données « e-Commune » sont déjà en place dans les communes pilotes, accessibles en ligne sur https://niger227.cyou/commune/ et comptent 230 indicateurs sectoriels, va contribuer à améliorer la planification du développement et le suivi de la mise en œuvre des priorités locales, la transparence de la gestion des ressources communales et la diffusion des informations statistiques communales à travers des tableaux de bord communaux. Sur la base des leçons tirées du programme national actuel et de l'analyse actualisée du contexte du programme, le nouveau CPD s'orientera vers une programmation plus intégrée et vers une convergence géographique renforcée. Plus spécifiquement, le CPD se concentrera sur deux domaines : contribution à la réalisation de la couverture nationale des services sociaux; et le renforcement de la résilience, l'approche nexus et la préparation et la réponse aux situations d'urgence. L'UNICEF Niger entend ajuster sa stratégie de gestion à travers le renforcement des capacités opérationnelles des programmes et des opérations ; la décentralisation de l'expertise du personnel ; le renforcement des capacités du personnel ; et des changements dans la structure organisationnelle et hiérarchique. "
WCAR,Nigeria,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Innovation and digital transformation are change strategies to accelerate achievement of programmatic results. For example, for birth registration UNICEF is piloting an electronic civil registration and vital statistics (eCRVS) innovation that meets international standards and can handle Nigeria’s large population needs as one component of a multi-sector change management and legal framework strengthening approach.
 
In 2022, UNICEF adopted a new framework for innovation, expanding focus beyond digital solutions. While lightweight, the innovation framework supports the decision-making process on where to focus the office’s time and resources to efficiently scale up new solutions. 
 
UNICEF leveraged the COVID-19 prioritization of and investment in oxygen
systems to address the chronic oxygen gap for RMNCAH needs. UNICEF Oxygen System Planning software was piloted and adopted nationwide to inform placement of procured oxygen equipment, as well as investment plans at the national level and in 14 states. In 2023, UNICEF will assess oxygen plant and power supply product innovations as part of the model to increase oxygen access. 
 
Over the past five years, UNICEF with state partners has invested in integrating foundational literacy and numeracy into Qur’anic schools. By training school facilitators, rehabilitating infrastructure through small grants and providing instructional materials to learners, foundational literacy improved from 4 per cent in 2017 to 29 per cent in 2022, outperforming children in public schools. 

An Individualized Learner Unit Record Information Tracking System (LURITS) was piloted across 18 LGAs in four northwest states in 2022. This tracks admission, attendance, movement and progress and will be replicated in 2023 and advocated for scale-up. In addition, UNICEF and government are co-designing a blended modality for upskilling teachers through the Nigeria Learning Passport (NLP) referred to as Learning Labs, to be field tested in three states in 2023. 

UNICEF is harnessing innovation to deliver results with and for adolescents and young people through partnerships. With over 65 million young people aged 10–24 years, Nigeria has one of the youngest populations in the world and represents an extraordinary opportunity for development and growth. Through the UNICEF Generation Unlimited Nigeria partnership, twelve private sector partners including Jobberman, Google, and Facebook have upskilling and youth engagement opportunities on the Youth Agency Marketplace (YOMA) digital platform. 
 
UNICEF U-Report polls provide Nigerian youth with an opportunity to share their opinions, needs and aspirations and direct young people to the skills and engagement opportunities on the YOMA platform and youth-friendly HIV prevention services as part of Yah Naija, formerly U-Test. In 2022, 1.1 million new U-Reporters were registered, a massive growth bringing the total number of U-Reporters to just over five million. Currently 38 per cent of U-Reporters are female, and 53 volunteers were recruited for the Young Person’s Action Team at state level to mobilize adolescent girls and young women aged 10–24 years. 

Working with the private sector UNICEF supported increased digital access through expanding broadband internet coverage to over 400 underserved communities, connecting 207 schools to the internet, and getting the Nigerian Learning Passport and YOMA whitelisted by IHS Towers and Airtel. With improved access, the current users of the digital learning and skilling platforms, Nigerian Learning Passport (122,000) and YOMA (115,000), are expected to grow significantly. 
Connectivity and digital access are enablers of the new adolescent girl strategy and initiatives such as ‘Building Back Equal’ being undertaken in the northwest to address the gender gap for digital and financial inclusion and advance both education and child protection strategies, girls’ agency and leadership. 

UNICEF pioneered innovative financing for construction of improved toilets by the private sector in two states. This resulted in the construction of an estimated 95,113 improved household toilets with over US$1.2 million mobilized from sanitation revolving loans, sanitation pool funds and household self-financing. Lessons from this innovative approach to financing results for children are assessed for replication including in other sectors. 

Preparations have been completed for a 2023 assessment called MICS PLUS, a new longitudinal real-time data collection tool for population data gaps that are best measured with high frequency, and which change seasonally. The aim of MICS PLUS is to compliment MICS and provide policy makers with time-series information on selected indicators to inform their programmatic and management decisions.

UNICEF has enabled and expanded private sector partnerships for the local production and procurement of RUTF. To address 2022 production challenges, UNICEF is applying lessons learned from nascent industries to advocate and coordinate pre-financing mechanisms to ensure a ready supply of raw materials and an uninterrupted flow of RUTF. UNICEF will invest in end user monitoring to quantify access, application, product quality and caregiver knowledge.

The creation of a budget code for child-related public expenditure (ages 0–18) in Lagos is an innovative approach to address data gaps regarding public expenditure for children and the extent to which children are directly benefitting from public spending. Adoption beyond Lagos will be explored.

In the coming years UNICEF will position itself to continue delivering change for children and adolescents in Nigeria, as the country faces pivotal issues such as rapid population growth accelerating the already very young population; high levels of child poverty affecting children’s outcomes across sectors; and climate change driving another unstable layer of tension and conflict in the country. 

Moving forward, UNICEF will strengthen programme integration across sectors and linkages between development and humanitarian programmes, while continuing to focus on the most underserved areas towards leaving no one behind. 
"
WCAR,Republic of Cameroon,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Lesson #1. Emergency response 
Reduction in resource mobilization due to donors' fatigue in face of protracted crisis has impacted on UNICEF’s ability to efficiently respond to the complexity of humanitarian situations. Over the past two years, the HAC appeal mobilized less than 50 percent of the planned amounts. A key lesson learned to partially resorbs the financial stress, was the reinforcement of the localization approach to optimize efficacy in both humanitarian and development interventions. UNICEF, as co-lead of the Working Group on localization, with the active involvement of UN agencies and donors, has contributed to strengthening the capacity of national Civil Society Organizations (CSO) to deliver assistance in accordance with humanitarian principles. Additionally, engagement in nexus programmes is proving to be more effective in the reinforcement of ownership by stakeholders at the regional level and fostering complementarity between agencies. This strategy is being implemented in Mandjou and Garoua Boulaï councils with ILO, WFP, UNHCR, FOA, UNESCO. After one year of implementation, this reinforced collaboration is yielding promising results in resources leveraging amongst agencies and with municipalities. Additionally, the participation of communities is more effective.
Lesson #2. Convergence and collaboration with Municipalities
The decentralization process initiated by the Government represents a major opportunity to advance children’s rights at local level. Seizing this opportunity, UNICEF is spearheading the Child-friendly municipalities initiative, which includes building the capacity of municipalities to enable them to effectively lead on local development priorities, through the implementation of child-sensitive plans. Within the framework of this initiative, UNICEF has signed partnership with two municipalities committed to supporting the implementation of an integrated package of interventions for children with a forward-looking perspective on accountability and prioritization on investment in children at the local level. 
Innovation: maintenance of WASH infrastructure in Ngoura Municipality
One of the sector's major challenges across the country is ensuring the functionality and management of WASH services.  This is one of the causes of the high level of water supply system breakdown in the country (50 to 60 percent). To address the issue, UNICEF supported the development of a new operation and management model, taking the opportunity of the decentralization process. This new model is being implemented in the municipality of Ngoura (40,000 inhabitants), in the East region, where the level of functionality of the water supply system was as low as 45 percent. The model has led to a sharp increase of financial resources for maintenance of equipment and investments in services, as well as helped reinforce community management of WASH services. As a result, the water points functionality rate increased from 45 to 80 percent between January and October 2022. 
After one year of CPD’s implementation, ensuring continuous alignment of UNICEF’s interventions with the national priorities (NDS30) and UNSDCF’s strategic priority results remain relevant. 
Country Programme programmatic environment will continue to be affected by shock waves from COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine. This will impact on both supply and demand of basic social services. Henceforth, the Country Office will continue to harness opportunities provided by decentralization to reinforce partnership with municipalities, by leveraging on the 15 percent public budget special allocation for municipality to advance child rights at the local level. UNICEF will continue to diversify and reinforce partnership with a range of stakeholders (including business, and private sectors) lobbying to influence public resources allocation and seize opportunities to mobilize domestic resources for children. 
UNICEF will continue to strengthen its leadership in humanitarian response by reinforcing the coordination of nutrition, education, WASH, and protection clusters. Complementary work will be done through cash, localization and gender working groups. This will increase the efficacy and efficiency of the humanitarian response.
In 2023, capitalizing on the results of the ongoing Gender Programmatic Review, and reinforcing risk-informed programming based on the results of the Child Risk and Impact Analysis (CRIA), UNICEF will strengthen its strategic positioning, build new partnerships, and improve its strategies to accelerate results for children. Three key strategies are prioritized.
·       The First 1000 days approach. UNICEF aims to widen the number and typology of stakeholders engaged in the implementation of the First 1000 days approach and develop a strong monitoring mechanism to track results and changes for children at local level. Dissemination of the conclusions and recommendations from the evaluation of the Office work on birth registration (KRC7) will inform the preparation of the national forum on birth registration to be held in 2023.
·       The Child-friendly municipality initiative. By engaging municipalities in the child friendly initiative, UNICEF lays stronger foundation stones for the efficacy and sustainability of results achieved for children at local level. The initiative also helped in promoting integrated and targeted interventions across UNICEF programmes and accelerated results on all KRCs. Additionally, municipalities-focused interventions will enable to reinforce the nexus strategy in the Far North, Adamaoua and East regions.   
·       The child sensitive public budgeting. Based on the dialogue engaged with the Ministry of Finance, UNICEF will continue to advocate and influence in favor of a significant increment of public budget allocated to social sectors. This will reinforce the capacity of line ministries to support investments in infrastructures and well-staffed basic social services. 
·       Community engagement. To accelerate demand of basic social services and encourage community engagement around KRCs, community platforms will be reinforced to incorporate human rights and inform Social and Behavior Change. The setting-up of consultative groups of adolescent girls and several dedicated service platforms will reinforce the social accountability of children and transform adolescents into real agents of change.
·       Data and evidence generation. Availability of updated data remain a key challenge for effective evidence-based programming. Completing the 7th Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS#7), planned evaluations and research will be amongst major priorities in 2023.
Programme governance and internal control. Finally, the revision of Field Offices’ business model, audit and peer review recommendations will serve as building blocks towards reinforcement of accountability.

WCAR,Sao Tome & Principe,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Adequate financing and efficient public spending are core to addressing inequities for faster progress for children. The crisis resulting from the COVID-19 and the current Ukraine conflict have affected the trajectory of the country towards the SDG. In the current context, there is a challenge in terms of public spending, to minimize the negative impacts of these shocks on children, especially the most vulnerable; while maintaining and increasing equitable and sufficient financial resources for social sectors for longer term development.  As a result, it is key for UNICEF with other United Nations agencies, World Bank and civil society stakeholders to advocate for increased domestic funding in social sector and improved budget execution to tackle inequalities and build inclusive growth. 
The country suffers from a general lack of reliable and disaggregated administrative data, which impedes the strategic planning, the efficient monitoring and evaluation of results and impacts. One of the lessons learned is that national and district capacities need to be enhanced to generate quality disaggregated data to identify inequities, improve planning processes and investments for children. In 2022, alongside the five goal areas, UNICEF worked with governmental partners to improve data generation with adequate capacity building and introduction/ scale up of dedicated tools or systems. In 2022, the Country Office invested successfully on research and data analyses with SitAn, sectoral budget briefs, the MODA and several evaluations, which informed strategically the planning process. As a result, emphasis was given in the new CPD to the strengthening of administrative data systems to improve the quality of evidence, supporting the country to document progress towards SDG indicators. This will also benefit a more robust monitoring mechanism and the reporting on outcomes/outputs.  
2022 confirmed the need to reinforce evidence-based planning and advocacy. The CO invested in an evidence-based-planning training to build UNICEF capacity to use data to identify inequities. In the next programme, UNICEF will support evidence-based planning, helping the Government to identify excluded children, and orient budgets and plans to support children’s development. Evidence-based advocacy was also reinforced, capitalizing on the analyses and research conducted in 2022. The Country Office is committed to building upon the significant progress made in creating capacities and opportunities for evidence-based advocacy, with a particular focus on advocating for an increasing and more effective allocation of public resources. The social policy programme will lead and support the Health, Nutrition, HIV and WASH programmes to develop budget briefs as well as to disseminate findings and influence allocations and expenditures. The MODA will be disseminated in 2023, as a high-level advocacy tool for child-friendly decision-making. UNICEF will pursue advocacy efforts for increased equitable domestic allocation with a focus on priority areas, such as hygiene and environmental health to enhance the resilience to climate change. 
UNICEF's contribution to the implementation of the National Social Protection Policy and reinforcement of the system, has been leveraged through the Parental Education Program (PEP). Feedback from the partners indicated gaps in key expertise such as alcohol consumption and psychological support.  Based on these lessons, in 2022, UNICEF scaled up the scope of the programme through partnerships with CSO to provide specialized care. This significantly enhanced the professional service delivery while strengthening the management of cases of violence and abuse against children. Coordination of multi-sectoral services, information management and evaluation mechanism were consolidated with the adoption of an operations manual, the mapping of existing basic services to promote interoperability and the restructuring of the central and district leadership. Significant investments were made to consolidate the capacity of frontline workers from different programmes and social work force. 
Building on the increased collaboration with Health, Education and Child Protection sectors, the PEP programme has laid strong ground for multi-sectoral programming. The 2022 mid-term evaluation underlined the need to improve coordination and supervision mechanisms of the PEP implementation platforms. As multi-sectoral interventions have ramped up, the weak coordination, lack of alignment and ownership have hampered the effective implementation of multi-sectoral programme. Multi-sectoral approaches need clear coordination and monitoring systems with defined roles and accountabilities, alongside strong capacity building. 
The country fell short from achieving key results, related to ending open defecation, nutrition and violence against children with key bottlenecks linked to social norms and demand-related barriers. In 2022, the team transitioned from Communication for Development to Social and Behavioral Change, increasing the support to all programmes with dedicated interventions together with the adolescent programming. Several lessons emerged and will inform the new CPD. Evidence generation is a cornerstone for solid social and behaviour approaches, to have better understanding of the root causes. The lack of a coordination mechanism and synergy between different social mobilizers represents a missed opportunity to expand these interventions and is wasting limited resources available. There is a need to develop evidence-based sectoral and multi-sectoral social and behaviour change plan, at national and subnational levels with a strong monitoring framework, while ensuring community engagement for effective scale-up.
The support of young interns under the social affairs department to reinforce the capacities of the social workforce, at decentralized level, provided a good and effective solution, especially during the pandemic to respond and provide care to children at risk or victims of violence. However, challenges were met with regard to the sustainability of the programme and the absorption of the capacities. It highlighted the needs to include such initiatives in a more comprehensive and budgeted human resources strategy for the reinforcement of the workforce and the system.  
In view of the constraints and the lessons learned, UNICEF in Sao Tome and Principe identified the necessity to adjust its pathway to change towards a programme with a stronger focus on system strengthening and an increased technical assistance role at policy level. 2022 was a transitional year to progressively shift towards this new way of working which will be reflected in the new country programme 2023-2027 to accelerate contributions to longer term results towards the realization of the rights of the child and the SDG"
WCAR,Senegal,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"In 2022, UNICEF Senegal continued to spearhead innovations in youth development and private sector partnerships and drew lessons from gender transformative programming and investments in the well-being of its staff. 

Recognizing that the development of young people’s skills and the improvement of their employability play a key role in integrating the youth into the labour market, a key innovation was supporting youth employability throughout the country programme. In the COVID-19 response, for example, youth employability was facilitated through the partnership with MasterCard Foundation, where young people were involved in the design and production of innovative handwashing equipment for household and public use. This initiative finally can serve as a lever for other initiatives led by and for youth to better engage with them in the preparedness and response for future crises. 

In the context of the ‘Reimagine Education’ initiative, several digital learning innovations were developed with the Ministry of Education and Simplon and Salmaitou project partners, providing young people with opportunities to acquire 21st century skills, life skills, and skills for work. The private sector is a key player to accelerate these outcomes and ready to invest in building a qualified workforce while providing products and expertise instrumental for UNICEF, the Ministry of Education and partners to achieve results at scale. In this context, UNICEF had promising shared value partnerships conversations with mobile network operators and companies such as Nokia, to provide funding and technology. Another innovative area in entrepreneurship development for young people, especially young girls, was UNICEF support for the local production of dignity kits, which fostered young people’s vocational training, entrepreneurship, and social development.

Valuable lessons were learned in 2022. Regarding the eradication of harmful practices, while the partnership with the Youth Ministry continued to show tremendous potential in mobilizing young people and engaging them in social dialogue within communities and families on VAC and harmful practices, the End FGM Steering Committee visit made it clear that shifts needed to be made towards more gender transformative and rights-based approaches. Greater collaboration with civil society will also contribute to greater impact at community level. 

There is also a need to define how to apply a positive deviance strategy, to identify early-adopters of innovations and further engage young people as future parents, and men in the decision-making process. Despite decades of interventions and 14 years of the UNICEF-UNFPA Joint Programme on FGM, progress remains slow. To go to scale, accelerating the engagement of key sectors such as education and health is crucial. Community-based interventions need to be monitored, documented, and analysed so that they can be scaled up to reach a critical mass of people that will trigger change in FGM-practicing communities. When religious leaders have a strong stance against FGM, it is easier to eliminate FGM. It is therefore important to accelerate engagement in high-level advocacy with religious leaders.

Strategic lessons learned were identified during the Gender Programmatic Review. While there are gender equality champions at all levels in Senegal, there is overall a limited understanding of gender-related concepts, among professionals across sectors and at central and decentralized levels. This highlights the importance of further analyzing and integrating gender equality in all existing programmes. To achieve gender-transformation it is important to institutionalize gender in all spheres, beyond only designating gender focal points/units and hiring women at decision-making levels in ministries. All aspects of system strengthening, structures and services, should continuously identify, analyze and address underlying causes of gender inequalities. Knowing how to communicate and promote gender equality among families, communities and leaders resistant to change is critical, requiring culturally sensitive social and behavioral change approaches and increasingly gaining female and male gender champions in all walks of life from community to national levels. 

Finally, important lessons were learned in 2022 with the positive outcomes from the substantial investments made in strengthening the duty of care and staff well-being, particularly focused on career development, psychological safety, as well as gender equality and women’s empowerment. With a strong triangular partnership between the newly elected staff association, the human resources team and the senior management, as well as buy-in by all staff and involvement of the gender specialist, a coaching programme was implemented on the organizational culture and practices focusing on a positive/appreciative inquiry approach– with specific sessions focused on the women’s experience of the workplace environment.  Two all-staff retreats were held to identify quick-wins and longer-term actions, whose implementation has been systematically monitored in a participatory manner. Staff members, in particular managers, and all teams benefited from the ambitious coaching programme throughout the year, with frequent mini retreats to reinforce positive approaches on team leadership and collaboration. 

An independent review of the UNICEF sub-office in Kolda (covering the southern part of Senegal) was held to identify measures that will improve the duty of care of staff working in this remote location. The recommendations have been implemented, including with the imminent move of the team to new premises as of early 2023. 

Career development opportunities of staff in the General Services category were also prioritized with proactive encouragement of stretches, swaps, learning activities and field visits. Staff members achievements and contributions were systematically acknowledged and celebrated during bi-weekly all staff meetings and special events – with staff identified as ‘gender champions’ and ‘best managers’ praised for their accomplishments. As documented through the systematic staff well-being pulses and the global staff survey, UNICEF is assessed as a positive environment by most staff, especially regarding personnel empowerment, two-way communication, work-life balance, and standards of conduct. UNICEF will continue to invest in staff well-being efforts and promote active engagement and participation of all in the upcoming change management processes, in the context of the new UNICEF Country Programme Management Plan (2024-2028), the move to the UN House common premises and the rolling out of the UN Common-Back Office process in 2023.

WCAR,Sierra Leone,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Following three years of implementation, an evaluation of the current CPC is scheduled for 2023. Ahead of that evaluation, the CPC theories of change developed in 2019 remain relevant. In fact, much of the experience from 2020 to date appears to confirm key assumptions of the CPC and provide a better understanding of important elements of the assumptions. One of such assumptions is the importance of effective coordination of work by government, UNICEF, and other partners for the achievement of results. It has however emerged that UNICEF often needs to play a convening role in support of such coordination to work effectively with all stakeholders. This was the case when UNICEF coordinated work between the two government ministries responsible for education (MBSSE and MTHE), the World Bank, and FCDO to prepare the Sierra Leone ESP 2022 - 2025. The shared commitment created engendered more timely and up-to-date information flow that was crucial for all parties to play their respective roles. UNICEF replicated this successful approach to promote inter-sectorial and inter-ministerial collaboration in the school-Related Gender-Based Violence (SRGBV) pilot project and OOSC study and strategy. Monthly coordination fora brought together MBSSE, Ministry of Gender and Children’s Affairs, donors, civil society partners, and research institutes to update progress and share information around SRGBV work. The key lesson is that investment in effective coordination, though time-consuming and challenging, continues to be indispensable for achievement of more impact.
 
Access to financial data is a major challenge in the public sector thereby limiting the type of analyses that can be carried out. The current budget structure, which is aggregated at a high level, makes it difficult to undertake detailed analysis on child-sensitive spending based on published data. UNICEF engagement with the Ministry of Finance (MOF), leading to a mention of child budgeting in the 2022 National Budget Call Circular, is an entry point for future data input and analysis. Training of government personnel at the MOF and other sector ministries is however needed to build capacity in data and financial management area to close the gaps in data and evidence generation for decision making. 
 
Medical equipment/device management require reasonable inputs, systems and procedures, human and technology management, monitoring and supervision for them to produce desired effects and results. While this is the responsibility of all stakeholders, particularly the MoHS, there remains need for clear governance structure at the MoHS. While such a structure is yet to be solidified, strategic inventory taking of medical equipment and devices at PHUs was rapidly completed by leveraging the countrywide cold chain equipment assessment process. 
 
Technology, especially digital solutions, if used strategically and efficiently with clear objectives, can have transformative effects, particularly in enhancing transparency and accountability to drive sustainable development. It is in this context that there is an ongoing UNICEF-supported Digital Public Goods (DPG) initiative in Sierra Leone to assist the Government in developing, adopting, and deploying DPG products for sustainable development. For example, UNICEF supported the MoHS to develop a digital health roadmap to help the country operationalize its 2018 National Digital Health Strategy and prioritize adoption of digital health solutions to address health system bottlenecks. One of the potential digital health use cases is the 'PReSTrack' (Pregnancy registration and tracking application developed by DSTI) which can be improved to promote 'continuum of care' (through digitalizing the “Maternal and Child Health (MCH) handbook”). UNICEF and MoHS are also conceptualizing the MCH emergency room, which will maximize the use of real-time data. Once operationalized, this will be a game changer in enhancing accountability and timely actions. 
 
UNICEF continued to lead the UNCT Emergency Preparedness and Response (EPR) group in 2022, taking over from WFP, and co-chaired several of the Sector Pillars within the NDMA response system (also aligned with the UN Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC)) in WASH, Education, Communication, Nutrition, Child Protection /Psychosocial Support (PSS), and contributed to coordinating the humanitarian responses (floods, urban fires and civil unrest) and building local capacities. UNICEF is also a member of the inter-pillar coordination (MDAs, UN Agencies, NGOs/CSOs). Further joint UN efforts are needed to capacitate and support the GoSL (especially the NDMA and relevant MDAs) in the field of emergency preparedness and response. 
That notwithstanding, there is a need to re-focus efforts towards SBC skills development and expand skills development and integration beyond health and WASH sectors to prevent SBC work from being implemented in silos and/or in a manner that duplicates efforts and does not promote efficient use of resources. There is also a need for contextualization of SBC strategies and approaches for urban contexts, including in use of mass and social media instead of duplication of community engagement strategies applied in rural context where the bulk of UNICEF-supported initiatives may be found.
 
Looking forward
 
The year 2022 started as the penultimate year the current CPC 2020–2023. Mid-way through however, the Government and the UN system in Sierra Leone agreed to a one-year extension of the UNSDCF and the associated CPCs involving UN agencies, funds, and programmes. The extensions were agreed to accommodate the fact that general elections are scheduled for June 2023 and, in the build up to the elections, government partners and decision makers may not be available to participate in the process of developing a new UNSDCF and the associated CPC for a new programme cycle to start in 2024. At the time of reporting, documentation for the GoSL-UNICEF CPC extension was being put together for formal approval by the UNICEF Executive Board. Unless the evaluation of the country programmes scheduled for 2023 and other evaluations point otherwise, UNICEF-supported work in 2023 and during the CPC extension year (2024) will continue to be carried out within the framework of the current GoSL-UNICEF CPC. In doing so, efforts will draw strongly on lessons learned and the momentum that had been generated by the end of 2022. Thus far, based on current state of knowledge, 2023 and 2024 should be the beginning of the post-COVID-19 era for even more rapid achievement of results for children in Sierra Leone.

WCAR,Togo,Lessons Learned and Innovations,"L’approche périmètre brachial, une lueur d’espoir pour les enfants
 
L’avènement de la COVID-19 a révélé la fragilité du système de santé face à des évènements majeurs imprévus, avec des risques élevés de défaillance et des difficultés d’adaptation aux changements intervenus.
Pour atténuer les effets de ces risques, le pays doit renforcer les capacités du système de santé, des communautés et des individus à devenir plus prévenants et plus réactifs aux chocs afin d’éviter d’être confronté à une grande urgence épidémiologique.
 
Selon MICS 2017[1], le retard de croissance concerne 23,8 % des enfants de moins de 5 ans, atteignant 29,7% en milieu rural et 14,2 % en milieu urbain, 33,2% chez les ménages pauvres et 10,9% chez les ménages riches. Le taux d’insuffisance pondérale était en moyenne de 15%. La pandémie COVID-19, la flambée des prix consécutive à la crise ukrainienne et le débordement de la crise du Sahel sont des facteurs susceptibles d’aggraver cette situation nutritionnelle.
 
Le pays dispose d’un vaste réseau d’agents de santé communautaire pour renforcer l’accès aux soins de santé de base. L’approche périmètre brachial familial (PB mères) a été introduite au niveau village en s’appuyant sur ce réseau communautaire par le ministère de la santé avec l’appui de l’UNICEF. Cette approche se révèle être une stratégie pouvant atténuer la dégradation de la situation nutritionnelle grâce à une large participation au niveau familial. Cette approche vise à renforcer les capacités des mères/gardiens d’enfants de moins de 5 ans à surveiller l’état nutritionnel de leurs enfants à l’aide de la mesure du périmètre brachial. Au total, 21.023 mères/gardiens d’enfants de trois districts ont été formés dans la région des Savanes. Elles ont été suivies par les agents de santé communautaire pour s’assurer qu’elles prennent correctement les mesures. Cette approche a contribué à une meilleure détection précoce de la malnutrition aigüe au niveau communautaire. Par exemple, 50% des cas de malnutrition aigüe sévère ont été détectés grâce au périmètre brachial mesuré par les mères dans le district de Kpendjal. Tous ces enfants ont été référés dans les centres de santé pour la prise en charge. Le taux de guérison dans les centres de récupération et d’éducation nutritionnelle est de 76%.
 
Cette approche s'est avérée être une approche efficace, pouvant être assurée par les communautés elles-mêmes, pour prévenir la malnutrition dans les zones éloignées des centres de santé et dans celles où une chute de la productivité agricole est enregistrée en raison par exemple des sécheresses répétées ou des inondations du fait du changement climatique. En plus, cette approche favorise une prise en charge précoce des cas de malnutrition qui permettra de réduire le risque de mortalité liée à la malnutrition sévère grâce au mécanisme de référence existant entre le niveau communautaire et les formations sanitaires.
 
Le principal défi d’ancrer durablement la mesure régulière du périmètre brachial des enfants dans les habitudes des mères. En effet, après l’engouement des débuts, beaucoup de mères arrêtent de le faire et finissent par perdre les techniques de prise du périmètre brachial. Par conséquent, les agents de santé communautaires ont été invités à faire des visites à domicile régulières et à organiser des sessions de recyclage pour les mères déjà formées.
 
Pour le passage à échelle de cette approche, les groupements de femmes, les leaders religieux et communautaires sont autant de plateformes à exploiter pour toucher davantage de pères, de mères et de gardiens d’enfants. En outre, le renforcement des capacités des leaders naturels dans le cadre de l’Assainissement Total Piloté par la Communauté sur le périmètre brachial (PB) mères permettra de l’étendre à d’autres communautés. La société civile jouera également un rôle clé dans la mesure où toutes les Organisations Non Gouvernementales œuvrant dans l’Assainissement Total Piloté par la Communauté ont introduit dans leurs cahiers de charges l’implication des acteurs dans la promotion de cette approche.

Les plans de développement des établissements scolaires pour une gouvernance participative
 
Pendant longtemps, l’absence de plans de développement des établissements scolaires n’a pas permis de définir des priorités consensuelles pour les écoles au niveau communal et communautaire. Les conclusions de l’évaluation de l’initiative Ecole Amie des enfants, réalisée en 2020 avec l’appui de l’UNICEF, ont mis l’accent sur la nécessité de développer des mécanismes de recherche de sources de financement local durable des Plans Triennaux de Développement d’Ecole et l’importance de l’implication de l’Etat, des communautés et des communes dans le financement de ces plans. Ainsi l’UNICEF en tant que chef de file des partenaires techniques et financiers de l’éducation, et co-lead du groupe thématique de la gouvernance participative, a conduit un plaidoyer auprès du Ministère de l’Education et des partenaires techniques et financiers du secteur pour harmoniser la méthodologie d’élaboration des plans de développement et permettre la mise à l’échelle de ces Plans Triennaux. 
 
Un groupe technique national a été mis en place pour le développement et la validation du manuel avec l’assistance technique de l’UNICEF. 
 
Les capacités des inspecteurs, des directeurs d’école et des communautés ont été renforcées sur l’utilisation du manuel d’élaboration des plans triennaux de développement d’Ecole. 
 
En 2022, dans le cadre du co-financement du Partenariat Mondial pour l'Education et de la Banque Mondiale, les communautés éducatives ont utilisé ce manuel permettant à 100% des établissements scolaires du Togo de préparer leurs plans de développement et de pouvoir bénéficier des subventions au cours de l’année scolaire 2022-2023, pour la réalisation de leurs priorités en matière de qualité des apprentissages. 
 
Le plan de développement des établissements scolaires est un outil adopté par le Togo pour la gouvernance participative des écoles pour l’accès et la qualité de l’éducation. Le suivi de la mise en œuvre efficiente de ces plans de développement devra permettre d’assurer un impact réel sur la qualité des apprentissages. 
La Banque Mondiale s’est engagée à soutenir cette initiative durant la période d’exécution du projet PAQEEB qui s’achève en 2025. Le Gouvernement a intégré cette approche des Plans de Développement des Etablissements Scolaires dans le Plan du Secteur Education 2020-2030, ce qui constitue un gage pour sa durabilité.

WCAR,"WCARO, Senegal",Lessons Learned and Innovations,"Creation of regional repository for KRC accelerating practices
WCARO was influential in orchestrating cross-fertilization of innovations and practices in Cos  through knowledge-sharing and peer-to-peer learning sessions. The RO plans to create a single regional repository for KRC acceleration practices particularly those with potential for creating  transformational change. 
Strengthen monitoring and reporting of child protection violations
To achieve KRC# 5 Protect  children from Sexual Violence): it is vital  to continue strengthening systematic monitoring, reporting and disaggregation of results by types of child protection violations, including sexual violence. Such efforts are critical for SDG tracking (notably target 16.2.3). They also serve as a proxy for availability and uptake/use of quality and accessible services for survivors. Integrated case management and information-sharing between the justice sector and social services remains challenging. Long-term work on child protection information monitoring systems should be part of wider support to the data collection and analysis capacity of government partners. 
Resource gaps constitute a key constraint for advancing work on violence prevention and response. An investment case was developed with inputs from countries with KRC5 related programmes. In addition to seeking to mobilize external financial resources, WCARO is exploring opportunities across both humanitarian and development programming to leverage funds from within child protection and other sectors that play a role in preventing violence to strengthen resilient systems with effective referral pathways and that function across humanitarian and development contexts.
Collaboration to advance birth registration
While UNICEF has invested heavily in consolidation of evidence on the effectiveness of interoperability between civil registration and health, a critical challenge to further advance KRC7, is to move towards results at scale. To this end, child protection is seeking support from other sections (tech, data, monitoring and reporting, social policy) for better and more strategic use of data to improve planning and budgeting for scale.
 
Innovative methods for data collection
Both in crisis and regular programmes, insufficient funding from donors and govts make it difficult to use current tools (surveys etc) and requires innovative methods to collect key indicators in hotspots and reduce reliance on large surveys. Efforts to support government capacity to strengthen routine data collection should also be intensified while increasing efforts to raise and leverage funds for data work. 
 
Looking forward to 2023
In 2023, WCARO will take forward the lessons mentioned in this report and build on the achievements of 2022. The key guiding principle underpinning these efforts will be optimization of WCARO’s strategic contribution to accelerating progress towards the KRC-focused Regional Office Management Plan 2022–2025 and UNICEF’s Strategic Plan 2022–2025, in alignment with the SDGs and AU Agenda 2063.
Strategic and holistic support to country offices, with a focus on child rights advocacy, leveraging public/private partnerships, generating evidence on policy options that bring positive results for children, nexus, resilience and adaptive programming, and high-level advocacy and policy dialogue with regional institutions will remain WCARO’s key strategies to support the progressive realization of children’s rights in the region. "
